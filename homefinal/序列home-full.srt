1
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,833
OK. Hello.

2
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,233
Banana.

3
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,016
Hello, guys.

4
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:47,433
What's up?

5
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,116
What's up?

6
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:51,416
Hey. Hey. Hi, everybody.

7
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,550
I told Leeds in the You didn't.

8
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,916
You didn't hear that, OK?
No one heard that.

9
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:00,450
Oh, my fucking God.

10
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,450
There are days.

11
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,950
Where I'm just like, I'm
so on top of it, right?

12
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:08,433
I'm thinking so straight.
I'm thinking so clearly.

13
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,366
And then I fuck up with laughter
with, like, one thing, and it's

14
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,433
usually always the microphone. Oh,

15
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,566
But good morning, everybody.

16
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,400
A good morning. Good morning.

17
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh, my God.

18
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,683
Well, you're having a great day so far.

19
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:28,466
Are you having a great morning so far?

20
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,516
You just woke up.

21
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,733
I am super, super excited.

22
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:36,116
I really hope that our Internets doesn't
grief us again today.

23
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,383
For people
that don't know what happened last night

24
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,800
because I didn't mention I forgot to post
on Twitter by post on Discord, but

25
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,083
basically what happened

26
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:51,066
yesterday was our Internet
kind of baulked at self.

27
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,816
So I couldn't really continue playing.

28
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,316
Poor I could.

29
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,383
Turn off at the turn of text
the speech real quick.

30
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,916
But, um, yeah,
I had some issues with the Wi-Fi

31
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:06,666
and it wasn't working properly.

32
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,450
Like a stream
kept going on and off at times.

33
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,133
So I had to end to end the live
broadcast early.

34
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,416
So I'm really, really sorry about that.
I don't know why.

35
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,816
Um, I've been having that issue, but,

36
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,583
you know,
I really hope it doesn't happen today.

37
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,516
And I'm really,

38
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:25,300
again, I'm really sorry for the people

39
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,933
that, you know, couldn't

40
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,516
that were there last night.

41
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,816
But, you know, all those issues happens.

42
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,816
Like, I feel bad about it, you know, like,
I really do.

43
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,633
I think that's like
one of the biggest things that make me,

44
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:43,300
you know, a little sad,
if I'm going to be honest, is that,

45
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,433
you know,
I get those small discord problems or not

46
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:52,500
discord Internet problems because, like,
you know, my service provider is sucky.

47
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:58,316
So I think I'm going to be changing
my service provider because that's not OK.

48
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,933
It's pretty bad, bro.

49
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,500
It's pretty bad. Yeah.

50
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,350
And it's happened like,
you know, every now and then.

51
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:08,883
But som the fact that's happened
this much is kind of

52
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,516
kind of blair it's kind of cringe. So

53
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:16,000
I try and avoid that from happening again.

54
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:16,833
Yeah.

55
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,300
You are there for all.

56
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,900
The donations
and for the good service guys. It's OK.

57
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,616
I'm fine.

58
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:26,133
I like I rarely I.

59
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:31,833
Get a rarely do I ever get sad or, like,
genuinely upset over anything on stream

60
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:36,066
except for like,
you know, internet problems because, like,

61
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,700
that stuff it's, like, hard to control
or it's like, hard to manage, right?

62
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,716
Like, you really can't saw
you only can't do much

63
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,300
since you just got to sit
there and, like, sit with it

64
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:49,050
and you know, it sucks, bro.

65
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,366
Everybody
that has Internet problems know it sucks.

66
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:54,216
Like, you know,
you have plans of friends, like, online

67
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:58,066
or if you have stuff that you want to
see will far you know other people.

68
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,033
If you're a streamer like me, then,

69
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,766
you know, having those issues,
it just sucks, bro.

70
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,116
That's kind of frustrating, but

71
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,533
it's not the end of the world.

72
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,000
I think it's OK today.

73
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,500
I let's hope it's OK today.

74
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,333
If not, then. Oh, my goodness.

75
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,350
I am going to
I am going to stab, stab, stab a person

76
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,450
that's not a demon,
which is kind of rare for me.

77
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,000
You guys.

78
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,300
But aside from that, I am super duper

79
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,100
excited to play through and finish
little nightmares today.

80
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah, we're going to finish lol nightmares
still.

81
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,516
And also after that, I think we're going
to have time to finish home sweet home

82
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:37,900
because

83
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:40,266
we still haven't finished Home Sweet Home.

84
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,566
But I heard that there's like
a couple of hours left in the game, so.

85
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,783
I thought we could just do it all today.

86
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:46,566
Right.

87
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm also really liking Home Sweet Home.

88
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,316
You know why?

89
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,683
Because it's like

90
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,783
weaving in our nice.

91
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,550
What's it called?

92
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,916
It's we've in good cultural beliefs
and myths from, like, you know,

93
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,033
a different hour.

94
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:04,166
I just enjoy.

95
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,566
It when a game, like a good horror
game can, like, implement good,

96
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:12,383
you know, like, culture into the game
and be respectful of it

97
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,766
and like, you know,
I mean, it is a Thai horror game, right?

98
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,166
So like, of course it'd be.

99
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,950
And the people that made it are
I think they're Thai.

100
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,350
So is very accurate.

101
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,516
So like, you know, their beliefs
and their mythologies and all that stuff.

102
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,800
So I think that's really cool.

103
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,766
And I want to play
more games like that because

104
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,333
I don't know.

105
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,216
Just it's cool.

106
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:35,516
To learn about other people's like myths

107
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,516
and beliefs and like their urban legends
and all of that.

108
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:42,700
You know, that's why I really enjoy,
um, chilli's art games as well

109
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,266
because it's very like heavy on, aside

110
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,266
from like some of the more real or things
it's heavy on like, you know, those

111
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:53,850
Japanese culture and like different urban
legends and stories you know.

112
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,433
You can see side.

113
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,666
Well, that's why I'm been.

114
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,500
Having a lot of fun with it
and I want to keep playing through more.

115
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,400
And I don't know, I just can't I.

116
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,566
Can't hold myself back.

117
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,416
I really just want to play more of it.

118
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:10,633
It's kind of like an excuse
for me to just play more because I can sor

119
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:15,116
I'm not patient and I see more of the
I see the game because I've been enjoying

120
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:15,900
myself a lot more.

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,300
I love working so much.

122
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,516
There's so many people playing
horror games they still like.

123
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,100
It's so cool. Right?

124
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,550
I just really, really fucking love
the fact that, you know,

125
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,950
I can

126
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,566
that so many more people are like,
you know, getting their feet wet

127
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:39,100
and so horror to that aren't
like very much like experience before it's

128
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,033
so it's getting to see more of my friends
try it out

129
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,633
and seeing other,
you know, other streamers straight out.

130
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,150
It makes me happy

131
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,750
it makes me Alvey Dog Boy.

132
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,583
Roll the dice.

133
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,266
They're fake.

134
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,450
No, look, look,
I can take him off anytime.

135
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,500
Look, it's gone. Wow. Wow.

136
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,633
All Where's a dog, huh?

137
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,850
Rawalpindi. The dog. There's no. Dog.

138
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,750
Oh. Oh.

139
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,866
And then now it's back.

140
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:05,433
Now it's back.

141
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,333
But it's.

142
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,150
You can take it on and off.
It doesn't mean I'm the dog. Though. Okay.

143
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,133
It's just like, uh.

144
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,200
It's just like an accessory
you can put on.

145
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,416
It's like when you put on hair
clips, right?

146
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,800
No, I'm talking about.

147
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,516
So then you put on hair clips. Horror.

148
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:22,916
Horror? Yeah.

149
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,233
Where? Horror. Horror, horrors.

150
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,100
Mm hmm.

151
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,683
Okay,
I'm going to turn off the music, though,

152
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:34,416
and I think it's a good time
to operate on into the game.

153
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,100
Hi. Oh, today is my birthday.

154
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,900
Happy birthday.

155
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,600

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,366
It's OK.

173
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:27,816
We we're back now
and hopefully everything will be fine.

174
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,300
Manifest good internets today, please.

175
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,683
If you guys believe in manifesting,
then do that for me.

176
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,700
Manifest that.

177
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,550
We don't have any issues
for the rest of the stream.

178
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,283
Because, man,

179
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:43,450
Comcast has been
has not been making me happy.

180
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:45,216
And that's probably the reason why, right?

181
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,350
Because it's Comcast. Comcast, it sucks.

182
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:51,116
OK, Alvey didn't hear that

183
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,216
and decided to pull the plug on me
because I'm down.

184
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,416
All right.

185
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,000
By the way, I do want to talk about
something real quick

186
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,683
because like I did
see people talking about this

187
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,050
I thought was really funny,
but I just want you guys to remember,

188
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,933
like, hey, I am an independent

189
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,933
streamer slash receiver, okay?

190
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm by myself.

191
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,883
So that means like, I don't have

192
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,683
I'm not part of a company, right?

193
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,716
I don't have Gen mates.

194
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,600
Bloxham
and Narcotics are not my gym mates.

195
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,283
So, I mean, I.

196
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,183
Don't mind

197
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,266
I really don't mind being drawn with them
all the time because like, it's cute.

198
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:30,333
They're they're my friends are
all of them are really friendly to me.

199
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,883
And I love hanging out with them
because they're cool. They're my friends.

200
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,766
That's, that's, that's totally fine.

201
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:38,700
But I just want to make sure people know,
like, hey, I'm not, I'm not part of that.

202
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,283
I'm not in league. All right.

203
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,533
And and that's.

204
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:43,316
Completely. Fine.

205
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,350
Like, I know some people thought
I was for some odd reason,

206
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,650
but I'm not I'm just I'm just my own.

207
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,566
I'm just not though I am.

208
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:52,900
I have my own guild.

209
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,666
We are our own.

210
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,450
You know,

211
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,783
we're our own community.

212
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,566
Aside from that.

213
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:01,266
But like, they're still
they're still my friends.

214
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:02,350
They're very much still, like,

215
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,066
very great and amazing people
they like to hang out with and,

216
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,366
you know, play games with.

217
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:10,650
But I just wanna make it clear
that they I'm not part of that, and

218
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:14,800
it's I don't have to be a part of it,
you know,

219
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,616
like, I'm happy
the way I am on my on my own.

220
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,300
Like, that's why I'm sure.

221
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,316
All right. That's the only reason.

222
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,316
That's
the only reason why I'm shopping right now

223
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:28,766
is because I'm I'm not,
you know, part of a company.

224
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:33,716
And I decide to be who I am by myself
and on my own.

225
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:34,200
Right?

226
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,716
I just wanna make that a distinction

227
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:39,933
real fast so people don't get confused.

228
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,366
Mm hmm. Shop for is shopper

229
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,950
I know you guys understand, but
I just want to make that because I guess,

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you know, you there's new people around,
and they might not know,

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,066
and there's a language barrier,
so it'd be a bit confusing, I think.

232
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:58,350
And it's honestly like,
not the worst association because, like,

233
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,966
I do talk to them a lot, but,
you know, it's like

234
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,633
they're they're my friends,
so and I like talking to my friends

235
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,250
a lot.

236
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,516
Oh, bowel.

237
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:13,300
Bowel me.

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,866
Thank you for the eats and gifts also.

239
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,966
And I think if that's and gifts are
still Sam, thank you for the donation and.

240
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,050
Friend.

241
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,766
See I think there's a lot another said.

242
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:28,050
Donations are friendly I can't read.

243
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,216
Your name.

244
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:30,116
Hold on.

245
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:31,833
I want to see company.

246
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,800
See, I'm. Lovely.

247
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,950
Thank you for the gift sub. Yeah.

248
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,700
Thank you so much, bro.

249
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,450
Ah, that's for the sub.

250
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,650
Your old house. Okay.

251
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, that's Claire.

252
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,650
I think it's time we get into some horror
games for tonight.

253
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,300
I'm super excited, dude.

254
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,766
I really, really was looking forward.

255
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:55,150
So finishing up a nightmares
one more time, and then we can head on.

256
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,383
Saw actual on

257
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,016
the main.

258
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:01,750
Day last week,
I only had the chance to be the main.

259
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,900
Star of the. Show. They slept with you.

260
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,116
I'm happy to have come since last year.

261
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,116
And you really are my fave three months.

262
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,566
Thank you for being here.

263
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,866
There is no problem there.

264
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:17,016
And hope you had a great birthday
last week till.

265
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,766
My God, there's only the amount of odds.

266
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:20,250
On nations.

267
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,900
That come by, and we're like,
hey, it's my birthday. Today.

268
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,116
It's my birthday
today. It's my birthday today.

269
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,600
It's like, wow. Oh, my God.

270
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,450
But like I said before,
I think it makes sense because, you know,

271
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:34,983
there's a lot of people
and there's only 365 days in a year.

272
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,150
So it's very likely today's your birthday.

273
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:40,883
Like,
I feel like statistically it could be like

274
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,600
ten people's
birthdays right now. Right? So yeah,

275
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,366
OK, let me switch on over to

276
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,716
the video game

277
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,416
oh, wait.

278
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,166
I didn't click something.

279
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,416
I didn't mean to

280
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,016
oh, yeah, right.

281
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:07,650
Hold on.

282
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,400
My heart rate monitor hasn't
been working at all for some reason.

283
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,950
Like, I have it connected and hooked up

284
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:24,150
um, maybe I need mm.

285
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,733
I've never had
this issue before is the thing

286
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:33,033
where, like,
my heart rate monitor wasn't working,

287
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:35,400
you know,

288
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,550
like, it only started happening

289
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,850
recently for some reason,
and I'm trying to figure out why.

290
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,783
That's why that's the problem.

291
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:49,083
Not sure mm.

292
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,033
Yep. I have a heart.

293
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,233
And while there,
I installed the conveyor widgets

294
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,583
stall. Yup,

295
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,450
yup, yup, yup, yup.

296
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,600
But I really want to have
my heart rate monitor on the screen.

297
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,066
I don't know why. It's like.

298
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,116
Oh, says it's off line.

299
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,716
Oh, now it's all mine.

300
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:13,166
Huh huh. What, what?

301
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,100
What bruh?

302
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,900
My maximum heart rate is 179,

303
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,450
and my minimum heart rate was like 50
white.

304
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,850
How's it know that?

305
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,750
Oh, that's crazy.

306
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:37,000
OK, use the euro and just launch it.

307
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:41,766
Launch OK.

308
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,600
It should be there now.

309
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,650
What's not there?

310
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,500
Why is it not there?

311
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,866
Yeah, once I, you know, I was.

312
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,916
My heart was the highest it's ever
gone. Hm.

313
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,466
I I'm confused.

314
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,283
Why is it not showing up?

315
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:05,216
Do you guys see anything on your screen?

316
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,200
Hmm? And use window capture

317
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:20,016
uh, hold on a second.

318
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,716
I could just use window capture.

319
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,866
Right?

320
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:30,000
That that's definitely an option.

321
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:38,216
Mm. I'm not sure.

322
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,216
All guys, it's not my birthday.

323
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:43,016
I think. I think you guys.

324
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:46,866
I think you guys are confuse because like,
no, I didn't say it's my birthday.

325
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:47,800
It's, um.

326
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:49,466
I'm just

327
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:52,716
saying that saw a lot of people say that,
hey, it's my birthday today.

328
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:54,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

329
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,666
Right?

330
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:58,600
I wasn't trying to say it was my birthday.

331
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
It's not my birthday.

332
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,566
Sally.

333
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,016
Oh, there it is.

334
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,216
Oh, my God.

335
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,700
Oh, my God.

336
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,816
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

337
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,100
It's back, baby.

338
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,500
Whoa! Oh, my God.

339
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,133
We got to work again.

340
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Judah.

341
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,550
Holy shit.

342
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,650
That made me so fucking happy.

343
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,150
What the hell?

344
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,700
It works.

345
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh, I got to works.

346
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,700
OK, nice.

347
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,550
Mm hmm.

348
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,366
Now we don't talk.

349
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,016
Now we don't have to worry about that
anymore.

350
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,100
Okay, cool.

351
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,900
Yeah, cool.

352
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,883
Also, hold on really quick.

353
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,200
Let me just

354
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:49,683
do one more thing

355
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:55,050
oh, you are.

356
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,266
You're very on time. You're very on time.

357
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:57,966
Who is it?

358
00:23:57,966 --> 00:23:59,816
I need to like I need to figure.

359
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:01,166
Out which one of.

360
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,150
You motherfuckers is doing that.

361
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:05,666
Who is it, huh?

362
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,116
It's been so many times.

363
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,850
That they are
that they activate that sound or who.

364
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,200
Is. It's call them out right now.

365
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:15,750
Who's doing that, huh?

366
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,316
Who's doing that?

367
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,316
I still don't know who it is.

368
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:23,050
Like after all this time,
there's always one person.

369
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,833
There's always that
one person who does it.

370
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,200
When I try to hide myself,
they're so fast.

371
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,950
Today. Deal.

372
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,816
Was it because last night
I said, your slow ha Dianne your Dianne

373
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,750
your nerves all gone.

374
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,466
Your fucking nerves
will baby. Oh, fucking baby.

375
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,383
Come couldn't embarrass me last night
because you were too slow.

376
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,833
All stupid.

377
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,200
Who was it?

378
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,216
Who the fuck was it? It

00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,250

380
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,133
Send gifts
obviously would appreciate it, man.

381
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:54,816
Awesome.

382
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:56,416
Some kind of blue

383
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:58,166
I know it's a little.

384
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,483
Blue invites
like to match with the background.

385
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know how I don't know
how much you guys like that but.

386
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,216
All is shit.

387
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:06,933
Annie thank you.

388
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,066
For the 50 gift subs.

389
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,450
Holy fuck.

390
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you so much for 50 gifts.

391
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,316
Obviously I'll be having a great day.

392
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:14,883
Oh, one.

393
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,083
We give you a

394
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,050
uh. Uh.

395
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,766
That's for everyone.

396
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:21,816
But, like, you know,

397
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,916
as a as a little gift.

398
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,566
Yeah, I'm a little blue right now, but I.

399
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,816
Hope that's OK.
Do you guys do you guys prefer.

400
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,483
On on I want to know your preferences.

401
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:32,883
Do you guys like it when I'm a yeah.

402
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,116
Do you guys like it
when I'm blending with the background?

403
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,966
A little bit like natural,
the environments a little bit more?

404
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,783
Or do you do you prefer it if it's

405
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,150
you prefer if it's off like this,

406
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,816
so when you blend in

407
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:54,483
or do you want it to be off

408
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:58,883
OK, you can get a vote on it.

409
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,850
Sure, sure, sure.

410
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,250
I have myself
I'll blend in or not blend in

411
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,800
because either way, I really don't mind.

412
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,816
It's based on like what you guys want.

413
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,100
I thought I'd try out because I don't I
rarely.

414
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,850
Gets the, you know, blend myself in.

415
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,016
By the way, if you guys got any gift
subsidy or from your series till be shirts

416
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,016
give the people that's gifted subs a big
thank you.

417
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:23,583
All right.

418
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,383
If you got one yourself

419
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,566
I think a lot of people want the
the blend.

420
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:32,616
OK, you know what?

421
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:33,633
I'll do that

422
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:37,316
yeah.

423
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:39,550
Seems like a lot of people do.
All right. Give me a second.

424
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,883
Give me

425
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:45,250
another second.

426
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,250
OK? Should be good now.

427
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,150
Last time we left off,

428
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:04,750
we were like
about to go into the city hmm.

429
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,116
I wonder.

430
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:12,783
Hold on. Give me a second.

431
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,650
Give me a one.

432
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,716
One second.

433
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,166
This is weird.

434
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,150
Yes. Because, like,
I want to make sure, like,

435
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,033
everything works properly, OK?

436
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:30,966
So blue.

437
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,950
I feel so blue.

438
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:35,666
I feel so blue.

439
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:43,150
Attack OK.

440
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,716
I think that's all it's
how it's supposed to be

441
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,666
is the environment's really blue chill?

442
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,266
So I think that's why
there's a lot of blue light.

443
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,750
Or back of mono and sex.

444
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,316
Hey there, buddy.

445
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,616
Go hold your hand now.

446
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:01,900
Yeah.

447
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,333
This dude died

448
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:06,066
yeah.

449
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,266
He ran into the TV for some reason. Why

450
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,016
I think I.

451
00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:17,200
Right.
I think these guys, like, are, like,

452
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,916
hypnotised or something.

453
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,650
By it.

454
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,883
Have I found in the hats in the game?

455
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:29,583
Yeah,
I have found hats in the game already.

456
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,850
A few hats

457
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:37,266
I think the real horror here

458
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,950
is going to be avoiding.

459
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,716
All this, huh?

460
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:53,883
Oh. Oh, hey there.

461
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,950
I'm happy to meet with you live today.

462
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,450
Oh, I turn off Texas beach, dude.

463
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,333
I keep forgetting to do that. Are

464
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,500
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,616
I'll read out the donations
and stuff at the end of stream

466
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,883
he doesn't see me right

467
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:18,316
so I think I'm fine.

468
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:22,566
Yeah, these guys don't see me.

469
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:25,683
They're just focussed on the TV.

470
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't, do I?

471
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,316
But if I throw it out her,

472
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,316
I throw it out.

473
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:48,883
You on

474
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,166
no. She doesn't give a shit.

475
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,116
Really.

476
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,800
Low top.

477
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,383
OK. OK, yeah, she gives a shit also.

478
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,050
Hold on.

479
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,566
I think, I think it might be broken.

480
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:16,000
Guys are for some reason
the arm. It's not doing

481
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:21,400
exactly the way that I wanted to
so I might have to actually turn it off

482
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,833
for today because it's been staying blue
the whole time and it's not supposed to.

483
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:32,100
And it's like a very awkward,
it's very awkward how it's doing it.

484
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,083
So I don't like that.

485
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,333
We're just gonna turn off for now. Yeah.

486
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,016
And then maybe we'll fix it.

487
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:40,116
So next time

488
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:42,416
that's ok.

489
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,916
Yeah. Thank you.

490
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,666
Thanks for understanding.

491
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,050
Because, like, when it goes to black,

492
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,916
it should also blend in with the black,
but it doesn't do that. So

493
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,950
it's weird.

494
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,433
But. Yeah, but

495
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,650
that doesn't look safe.

496
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,300
Isn't that, like, you know what?

497
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,200
If it falls into the.

498
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,716
Bathtub and you get electrocuted,
is that like, how people say,

499
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:18,783
don't use your hairdryer
near the bathtub and stuff to

500
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:26,650
oh, that's fine.

501
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,616
We're just gonna ignore him.

502
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:30,600
That's not our problem.

503
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,250
Can I push the TV?

504
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,516
You only push the TV.

505
00:31:36,516 --> 00:31:39,816
And so that's cruel.

506
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,716
That's cruel, bro.

507
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:47,666
On boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

508
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:50,316
It sounds like the Barney song.

509
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:51,716
I love you.

510
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:53,700
You love me.

511
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,100
You all that.

512
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,733
I hated the Barney song.

513
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,850
Life is super creepy, man.

514
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:06,483
Wait, how do I. Huh?

515
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:16,566
Oops.

516
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,450
Oh, OK.

517
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,466
Fuck.

518
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,800
Barney was cute.

519
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,366
Barney's creepy, Vanya scary.

520
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,483
And there are like,
that purple fucker the.

521
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,700
Sorry, guys.

522
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,450
I just he
he scared me a lot when I was a kid.

523
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:45,366
Yeah.

524
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,966
Let's see what's over here.

525
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,833
Check inside

526
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:52,316
Barney got arrested.

527
00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:54,416
I think. You know what?

528
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,400
It adds up.

529
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
It adds up to me.

530
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,633
Makes sense.

531
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:02,100
It's it's creepy.

532
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Oh, that's how we got up here.

533
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,533
OK, nice

534
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,816
lie. I'm sorry.

535
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,316
It's a lot to everybody else.

536
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:17,616
I just. I couldn't. I couldn't really.

537
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:18,550
I he.

538
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,850
Sports. He's so spooky, man.

539
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,866
I don't like his beautiful eyes and just

540
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,083
his smile.

541
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,416
His creepy little smile.

542
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,050
We found a key

543
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:38,283
as long as I like Thomas the Tank Engine.

544
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,866
I you know, I kind.

545
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:41,950
Of like Thomas the Tank Engine.

546
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,133
Yeah, he's OK.

547
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,316
He didn't really carry me all that much.

548
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,666
Teletubbies creeps me out, though.

549
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,650
I don't like Teletubbies.

550
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,850
A funky so you can come inside now.

551
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,950
Hey, a friend. Friend

552
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,350
are you going to help me?

553
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,933
Come on. Come on.

554
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:07,766
Thank you.

555
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,250
Wait, what was I supposed to do?

556
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,516
Oh, ok. OK.

557
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:23,883
Never mind.

558
00:34:23,883 --> 00:34:24,550
I think I get it.

559
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,066
No, I think I get it.

560
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,950
Teletubbies are a nightmare in itself.

561
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,350
Why not? It's not really the.

562
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,933
Teletubbies that scared. Me.

563
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:36,000
It was the sun, the baby sun.

564
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,833
And, like, the way that they talked

565
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,483
the way that they talked, it's like

566
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:43,983
it reminds me of the way mist.

567
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:44,400
That's OK.

568
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,533
Sometimes

569
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,133
does that mean.

570
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,716
I don't know. I don't think that's mean.

571
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,750
You know, that voice,
that silly little voice.

572
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:01,316
He does oral

573
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:04,533
yeah. The baby.

574
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,666
The sun was just weird to me.
I didn't like it.

575
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,700
I didn't like looking at it.

576
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,000
Wow. Yeah, that's cool.

577
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:16,950
That's really cool.

578
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,550
I fully
expect to see a sea art of mystery.

579
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,200
The Teletubbies.

580
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,900
Now, I think they'll make him really,
really mould.

581
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,683
You know, you guys

582
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,416
seeing him as what's it?

583
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,733
Because on

584
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,316
the the whole high school musical

585
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,866
character.

586
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,466
Who's this guy.

587
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,916
Oh, hey there, my friend.

588
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,366
Now I think.

589
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,350
Oh, my God, there's rats inside.

590
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,900
Are these rats

591
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,416
like all these rats?

592
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,216
Look at the boys.

593
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,266
They're all dead though.

594
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:03,716
Them after the after the boys

595
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,450
squeak, squeak, squeak.

596
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah.

597
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,200
And I think he actually
was like moulding over

598
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,766
the fact that people kept what's in

599
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,216
making that association,
and it makes me laugh.

600
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,566
It's funny.

601
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,133
No, I can't open the door one more.

602
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,000
I suppose all.

603
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,683
I can open the door

604
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:39,750
the rats are kind of cute, though.

605
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,916
You guys are kind of cute.

606
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,083
I like to be.

607
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,883
Let's try and be a little sweet.

608
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:58,766
Once in a while. We.

609
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,483
How do we get that over? Oh, no, no, no.

610
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,333
I think.

611
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,666
Hey, you lift me up

612
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,850
lift me up, boost me, boost me, bro.

613
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:12,266
Boost, boost, boost. And get a boost.

614
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,416
Thank you.

615
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:20,500
Yeah.

616
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,466
And then I think she's supposed to grab on
to that and roll over also.

617
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,216
Michael
And thank you for that. Sincere ones.

618
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:29,666
There's a. Lot of. Yourselves for us.

619
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,233
Thank you so much.

620
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:37,383
And share all the support and love

621
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
give you a smooch

622
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,266
on the forehead for that, if that's OK,

623
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,933
if that is acceptable.

624
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,216
I still like I'm still like wondering

625
00:37:57,216 --> 00:38:01,300
why we're even on this little journey
together anyways.

626
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,366
Is this like, a

627
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:04,833
we're trying to get out

628
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,766
of here or like,
what's the what's the objective?

629
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:12,066
I know we've been walking around and
running around to try and like you know,

630
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:13,800
get away from those weirdos.

631
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,350
But at the same time,
why are we doing this?

632
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:20,616
Why we are why are we here?

633
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,116
You're shot.

634
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:23,166
The game was multiplayer.

635
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,600
Imagine if the game was multiplayer.

636
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,050
Oh my God, I'd be so. Cool, right?

637
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,600
I thought the.

638
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,900
Game was going to be multiplayer
on the first game out but no,

639
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:32,766
it wasn't

640
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:38,066
I would have loved to play a friend

641
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,816
I'm just a little guy.

642
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,650
We're all just little guys.

643
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,050
Those little world.

644
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:51,600
Little guy
can conquer the world on his birthday.

645
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,450
Would you

646
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,333
want functional games?

647
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,516
Birthday? Would you? It's happening

648
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,416
hello.

649
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,616
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's bad.

650
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, that's bad.

651
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,233
Oh, we got to run.

652
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,766
Over which way?

653
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:15,750
Oh, no.

654
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,500
I thought we died.

655
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,266
Oh, six.

656
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:26,850
Whoa!

657
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,800
Oh, no sex.

658
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,633
Wait, hello?

659
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,800
Sex. Sex.

660
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,033
How are you?

661
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,500
Still alive.

662
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,566
And you get crushed under all of that.

663
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:56,816
I am glad she's OK.

664
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,833
But it looked like she got destroyed
underneath that stuff down.

665
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,066
Lucky

666
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:09,100
Earth.

667
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,116
I hold your I hold your hand.

668
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,750
So, Beth, thank you for the laugh.

669
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,583
I guess up still.

670
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,083
Thank you so much.

671
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,150
Dude.

672
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:27,216
If if she actually, like,
broke her legs there during that part,

673
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,316
I would have been so sad, like,
genuinely upset.

674
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,283
And we can't
we have to, like, move on without her.

675
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,550
That would make me really fucking

676
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:40,600
what? Why jump so high there?

677
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, my God.

678
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,716
What?

679
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,800
Why me?

680
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,400
Why am I able to jump so high here?

681
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,716
This doesn't look right it doesn't feel

682
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,350
right. Huh?

683
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,116
That's weird.

684
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:06,983
OK, I just didn't expect

685
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,150
that from

686
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,266
I hope she never dies.

687
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,450
No, not again.

688
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,600
You just walk away from it.

689
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,566
You just walk away from it.

690
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:39,216
It's time to go back in.

691
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:41,583
So I go back into the TV world

692
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,733
and see what the fuck is up

693
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:51,016
oh, this is weird.

694
00:41:55,916 --> 00:42:00,700
Why are

695
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,466
every time we do that, I don't.

696
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,616
I know we're trying to, like, tune it

697
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,050
to frequency, but

698
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,950
I only wish you'd open that door, bro.

699
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,183
It seems like a bad idea.

700
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,833
I think we should open that door.

701
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,533
Or six.

702
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,250
He's outside.

703
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,350
Not in the not in the TV.

704
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,833
Or hello.

705
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,483
Who's inside

706
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,600
oh, hey, it's Slenderman.

707
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,266
Oh, wait.

708
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,416
Is he coming?

709
00:43:26,216 --> 00:43:27,416
Is he coming?

710
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,050
Always, always.

711
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,466
Hey, we should run.

712
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:39,566
I think. I think we should run, dude.

713
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:43,016
Yeah, yeah.
This is not very funny anymore.

714
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,116
It's not funny anymore.

715
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,666
Put, don't run.

716
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,533
What are you doing?

717
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:15,100
Oh, oh, oh.

718
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:40,750
Oh, wait.

719
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,383
Sex. Sex.

720
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:54,566
Are we alone?

721
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:56,400
She's gone.

722
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:01,316
She's.

723
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:02,583
She's gone.

724
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,350
Oh, I mean.

725
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,900
We've just got to go back inside

726
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,266
and get her right

727
00:45:21,183 --> 00:45:21,616
yeah.

728
00:45:21,616 --> 00:45:22,116
Where

729
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:24,183
the fuck.

730
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,383
Dude?

731
00:45:28,383 --> 00:45:32,750
What's all of the the creepy look and I
and all the all the guts and

732
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,583
and squishy bits.

733
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,483
That's sad, though.

734
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:42,366
Was that was like our buddy
since the beginning.

735
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:43,916
Now she's gone

736
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:48,783
now he's all by himself again.

737
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,716
He's all alone.

738
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,500
Yeah. I go. I'll go save her friend.

739
00:45:58,016 --> 00:46:00,033
From the weird TV man with the fedora.

740
00:46:00,183 --> 00:46:03,000
He has a fucking fedora

741
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,416
I like that a lot.

742
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:10,650
The it's cool way of transporting. And.

743
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:15,900
Why you want

744
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:24,400
oh, ok.

745
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,700
OK. Right. I think yeah.

746
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:29,850
That's a bring the TV to the other side

747
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,283
and use the portal

748
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,233
that's going to be like

749
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:39,216
it's going to be a little

750
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,650
portal puzzle.

751
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:45,900
I don't know what to call it.

752
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,583
Now. There's basically portal puzzles.

753
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:48,216
Yeah.

754
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,200
I like it.

755
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,033
I like it though.

756
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,500
It's, I think a bit more

757
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,866
now. What I don't like though,

758
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:06,816
are those weird motherfuckers.

759
00:47:06,816 --> 00:47:10,050
Those guys of the warped
faces are looking at the TVs.

760
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,633
What are those monsters called?

761
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:13,850
Do they even have a name?

762
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,666
Are they just the adults are going crazy
because all of them are like looking at

763
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,533
the TV's are being absorbed by it.

764
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:25,166
Oh, I died. Oh.

765
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:29,066
What high die

766
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:31,233
I mean, how do you mean aliens?

767
00:47:31,233 --> 00:47:32,850
I jumped the fuck off.

768
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,066
What am I supposed to go, though?

769
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,933
Up here?

770
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:43,833
Oh, dude, I'm my my my eyes are.

771
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,000
Just I'm just blind sorry.

772
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,600
I don't have a good depth perception

773
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm cringe, Your Honour.

774
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,466
No cap

775
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:08,166
you know

776
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,833
the TV noises that are coming from it
like it sounds like.

777
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,083
It sounds like.

778
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:19,150
How how do you die from that brawl, mano?

779
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:22,050
Sorry, Mano. I'm sorry.

780
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:22,783
It kind of reminds.

781
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,416
You of

782
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:26,733
oh, I live.

783
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:27,566
Holy shit.

784
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:29,316
I lived there.

785
00:48:29,316 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah. Reminds me of them.

786
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,700
What's it called?

787
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,016
Arcade

788
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:37,450
soft.

789
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,666
I would hear from an arcade

790
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,050
at the games.

791
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:53,916
Oh, hmm.

792
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,966
They just gives that particular vibe,
I guess.

793
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:02,666
Yeah, like those.

794
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:06,483
There's certain, like, arcade games and,
like,

795
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,866
crying games that make like, a lot of,
like, music.

796
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:13,533
So silly music noises like that.

797
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:19,150
Hold on.

798
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,333
I think that's a move. This

799
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:25,233
if I move,

800
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:29,466
that is to be a platform
for me to jump over.

801
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,600
Wow. This e

802
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:42,416
arcade music real a lot.

803
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:43,983
Sometimes it's really.

804
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:46,683
Arcade music is nice,
though. Gives me some.

805
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,866
It gives me a nostalgia boner

806
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,150
you ever hear of that term
nostalgia boner?

807
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,150
Me neither.

808
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,116
It makes zero sense.

809
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,716
I still use it anyways.

810
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,050
You're probably drunk right now.

811
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,800
I'm not drunk.

812
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,516
Sir. It is

813
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,866
9:43 a.m.. In the morning.

814
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,700
Why would I be drunk?

815
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,950
I have not consumed any alcohol.

816
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:30,666
Well, e

817
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:38,016
as you

818
00:50:38,016 --> 00:50:55,500
know, I'm here ah.

819
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,550
OK. That's creepy.

820
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,516
But what the fuck am I supposed to do?

821
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,450
Yeah, how am I supposed to

822
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:12,350
am I?

823
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,766
Am I supposed to hide from her?

824
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:17,933
Yeah, I think I'm supposed to
do something off the TV.

825
00:51:18,266 --> 00:51:20,800
Well, I'm not sure what it is.

826
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,266
Yeah, I think I had to, like, get
through the TV by to get her away from it.

827
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:29,016
Well, how

828
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,300
you hide first?

829
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:39,700
Yeah. Where do I hide?

830
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,883
Where should I hide?

831
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,400
She ate me.

832
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,066
What was I supposed to hide there? Hmm?

833
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:02,650
Damn it!

834
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,216
Damn it, Jim. It's

835
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,766
what's that song, though?

836
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:11,800
I don't know.

837
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:17,100
To keep the door open to the door open.

838
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:21,716
Fuck, no, no.

839
00:52:21,716 --> 00:52:23,700
The door is closing

840
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:28,166
yeah.

841
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,916
Where am I supposed to hide from her?

842
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:31,466
Like back here.

843
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:37,600
Oh, guys,

844
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,650
I don't know where to go,
or I must watch the fridge.

845
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,683
Maybe throw something.

846
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:55,450
There's a TV.

847
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,116
Oh, you're right. There's a TV outside.

848
00:52:58,116 --> 00:52:59,066
It's right there.

849
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:01,133
Wait, so maybe she'll go to that one

850
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,666
that you happen to have?

851
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:25,383
That was stupid. OK.

852
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:27,033
So now I can go through this, right?

853
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:27,416
And where is it?

854
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:36,216
Take me now.

855
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,966
OK, turn this off.

856
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,233
Let me turn the TV off. OK,

857
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,166
you want the kitchen to call her stupid?

858
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:46,716
Of course.

859
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:47,616
Yeah,

860
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,533
I don't know why.

861
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:56,016
They turn into those, like, warped face
creatures, though.

862
00:53:57,216 --> 00:53:59,366
If they're, like,
just if they were regular people

863
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:02,433
and then they just suck you in.

864
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:03,633
Like this guy right here. It's you.

865
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:04,600
Look at him.

866
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,316
Hold on. Wait.

867
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:10,950
Like an.

868
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,066
Evolved.

869
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,783
That's fucked up.

870
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:21,450
That's so fucked up, bro. All

871
00:54:23,816 --> 00:54:24,483
by me, I guess.

872
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:26,550
Better. Better him than me.

873
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,166
I don't want to die.

874
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,516
Oh, oh, oh.

875
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,550
Off mono, mono

876
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:39,683
yeah.

877
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:41,350
Yeah.

878
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,866
I guess they're so obsessed of it

879
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:46,350
that they don't even pay attention
to their to their own surroundings.

880
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,633
They just walk off anything.

881
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:51,566
They only fixate on the TV.

882
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,266
I Jarvis nor

883
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,700
I press the jump button.

884
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,516
I swear.

885
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,316
I swear I did

886
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,716
you hear that?

887
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:09,366
I'm pressing jump right now.

888
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:11,350
I press the jump on.

889
00:55:11,366 --> 00:55:13,116
I do that to me

890
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:14,500
as I do.

891
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:14,816
That's me.

892
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:15,550
You guys

893
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,250
Bruce.

894
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,616
No, I thought those were bodies
hanging out there.

895
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,800
And now these are people huh?

896
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:45,400
Why are they falling off the building?

897
00:55:55,266 --> 00:55:56,050
Why are they all falling

898
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,833
off the building for

899
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:04,533
the aliens? No,

900
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:07,700
I don't think so,

901
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,350
bro. Bro, what

902
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,683
am I supposed to not do that

903
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:16,900
hold on.

904
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:18,566
What the fuck?

905
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:19,466
Give me a second.

906
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:20,733
Give me a second.

907
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:25,733
Let me try and save myself

908
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:27,783
one, ok? OK.

909
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:31,500
Maybe I should go outside and pull the TV.

910
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:35,466
So that I don't. Die

911
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:44,200
or maybe I should push the tv down.

912
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,100
Yeah, I like that.

913
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,566
That makes a lot more sense.

914
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:56,066
I'm not a knowledge on laker.

915
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:56,733
I can't.

916
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:57,950
I can't park

917
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,983
off. Of our

918
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:05,350
buildings, ops and the sides of buildings.

919
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:07,116
OK, he can

920
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:13,216
we that you.

921
00:57:13,216 --> 00:57:17,283
All electrocute

922
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:21,000
the water we.

923
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:30,933
Are there's something
on the other side of that door.

924
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:34,716
I think
we're going to have to run from it.

925
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:40,450
Oh. Ha.

926
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,333
Oh, no, no, no.

927
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,066
Don't hurt me.

928
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:52,833
Come dumb-ass hat.

929
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,000
I forgot four.

930
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,500
Oh, my God. I forgot to turn off the

931
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:04,983
I forgot to.

932
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:07,266
Turn it off before I walked back in

933
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,050
oh, my God.

934
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,366
OK, it's it's fine. It's fine.

935
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:13,983
We know what to do now.

936
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,966
Everything calm.

937
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:23,166
I just. I was.

938
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,200
Look, I

939
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:30,116
I just forgot what

940
00:58:30,116 --> 00:58:30,983
happening.

941
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,683
Now it's turn it back off, ok?

942
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,650
He was a lot faster this time.

943
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,933
I mean, that was just more slow.

944
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,383
Now it's really fucking quiet.

945
00:58:54,383 --> 00:58:55,883
It'll be.

946
00:58:58,016 --> 00:59:03,066
All. Nasty on the creepy music, man.

947
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:07,116
It's really creepy music.

948
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,233
Can weird

949
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,850
a TV.

950
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,216
There's a TV inside the elevator.

951
00:59:28,716 --> 00:59:30,216
I think.

952
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:34,316
Are we supposed to get back inside now?

953
00:59:34,316 --> 00:59:36,033
Oh, hold on, hold on.

954
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:37,083
I think we use this as.

955
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:40,316
Like, our little old stuff stool

956
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,716
it's like, jump up and open up the switch.

957
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:48,516
Yeah. What's that music did?

958
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:50,500
Does anybody know where that music's from?

959
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,700
It sounds familiar.

960
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,600
Unless it's, like,
you know, just some random gibberish

961
00:59:57,116 --> 01:00:00,183
and if it is an OK

962
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,533
womp, womp, whatever,

963
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:28,750
way, I think I understand
what I got to do.

964
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,700
I think.

965
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:42,583
It's you I huh.

966
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,316
Do I understand. What I see?

967
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:52,383
You give me a second. Hmm?

968
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,716
Ha. OK, hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on.

969
01:01:29,316 --> 01:01:29,966
How do I.

970
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:31,600
There's, like, those. Windows at the top.

971
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,550
I know how to get
on the top of the elevator, but how.

972
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:34,983
Do I do that?

973
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,700
Jump through the whole

974
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:40,616
yeah.

975
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:41,883
I don't know how to jump through the hole.

976
01:01:41,883 --> 01:01:48,483
How long oh.

977
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,316
All right, all right, all right.
All right, all right.

978
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:53,016
Paul The pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa

979
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:05,783
wait. Pop.

980
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,850
Oh, hold on, hold on.

981
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,650
No, no, no, no, no, no. I get it.

982
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,666
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.

983
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,833
I understand. Now give me some

984
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,883
Everything's.

985
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:19,950
Everything's connecting. Everything's
connecting. Now.

986
01:02:20,516 --> 01:02:21,266
I got it.

987
01:02:21,266 --> 01:02:22,233
I got it.

988
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,800
Now. Now we're in business.

989
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:39,316
Yeah, we'll get us hmm.

990
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,350
I'm smart.

991
01:02:43,683 --> 01:02:45,250
Fucking smart, too.

992
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,483
Yeah.

993
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:53,916
Unfortunately, like, I.

994
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:56,516
I was thinking a little bit
too hard about it.

995
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:56,733
Yeah.

996
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:58,900
All I had to do was just jump down
the hole.

997
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,566
I completely forgot. Like,

998
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
it isn't shut off the entire thing
when it goes down

999
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,550
like this looks dangerous.

1000
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,183
Because, you know,
because it probably is dangerous.

1001
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:18,483
Shop also.
Why the fuck do. You walk into the water?

1002
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:19,866
Oh, my God.

1003
01:03:24,516 --> 01:03:28,166
How do I get over there without dying?

1004
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:29,516
Jump.

1005
01:03:29,516 --> 01:03:30,400
Just jump.

1006
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:30,933
Easy.

1007
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:35,100
Just jump hop.

1008
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:39,350
I know.

1009
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,433
Then I jump far.

1010
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,350
Enough on. Hop.

1011
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,216
OK, there you go.

1012
01:03:55,316 --> 01:03:56,550
I think I know I got you.

1013
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:04,316
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

1014
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,766
Now, that was good.

1015
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,966
Oh, all the electricity in the in
the apartment turned off, though.

1016
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:20,816
That sucks.

1017
01:04:22,033 --> 01:04:23,766
What was the point of that?

1018
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:25,766
Oh, I just needed to get the stool.

1019
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,333
I was over here.

1020
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,216
All out for a goddamn stool.

1021
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:35,166
OK, sure.

1022
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,300
How many grannies have I killed?

1023
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,783
I think now that was only the first one.

1024
01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:45,183
We've we've murdered

1025
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:52,950
a row.

1026
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,750
Row, and they got gonna make it
more obvious.

1027
01:04:56,766 --> 01:04:57,750
I didn't know how to.

1028
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,266
Fall down into the dumpster.

1029
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:02,550
I miss my jump.

1030
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,066
I saw this TV off

1031
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:17,650
I'll be like, I'm all distracted by it.

1032
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:22,766
Yeah, it's a lot of them.

1033
01:05:22,766 --> 01:05:24,933
Let's just pretend like.

1034
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:28,500
Pretend like we don't see that
move on with the saw.

1035
01:05:28,766 --> 01:05:30,600
Next puzzle was this

1036
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,466
is a shopping cart.

1037
01:05:41,016 --> 01:05:44,433
That's why anything from the grocery store

1038
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,150
my treat, I think

1039
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,766
and I think I to go to the grocery store

1040
01:05:50,766 --> 01:05:53,016
today though to be honest,
I have some stuff.

1041
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,500
In the water.

1042
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,116
What a gun really water electrocuted.

1043
01:06:02,316 --> 01:06:08,350
Bra oh no.

1044
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,566
I cannot get up there.

1045
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:10,116
What's

1046
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:13,566
where I'm stuck?

1047
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,016
Wait, I'm stuck.

1048
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,450
I can't I can't move

1049
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:21,633
to get raw stuff from stuck.

1050
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:25,833
What I actually can't move, guys.

1051
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,300
Oh, my God.

1052
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,133
Why? Why am I stuck here?

1053
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:35,433
How modern move

1054
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,616
all of roll.

1055
01:06:37,616 --> 01:06:39,416
OK, we start from checkpoint, please.

1056
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,383
Thank you.

1057
01:06:48,816 --> 01:06:50,916
I don't know how

1058
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:51,866
I know how.

1059
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:55,416
That is possible that we got,
like, trapped in that scenario.

1060
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:58,416
But, hey, whatever happens, man,

1061
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:06,816
I think

1062
01:07:06,816 --> 01:07:10,766
I'll use the shopping cart this time
rather than trying to use, like, dumb

1063
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:14,966
dumb little

1064
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:17,766
what's it

1065
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,850
tricks?

1066
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:21,750
I wasn't even trying to.

1067
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,066
Use a trick or like, speed or whatever.

1068
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,983
I thought I could just jump over
the legend, walk on top of that on ebay.

1069
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:37,000
I can tell from here no OK.

1070
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,466
Obviously, that's all I need to do.

1071
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,666
Now. The water's off

1072
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,016
I need from here.

1073
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:53,883
There's a wind up key

1074
01:07:55,116 --> 01:07:58,683
huh? Wait,
what the fuck do I even pick up.

1075
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:02,966
All that ill?

1076
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:05,466
It's the fucking finale of toys.

1077
01:08:05,466 --> 01:08:07,800
Again from last time.

1078
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,933
I hate those.

1079
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,133
Cod. They're so creepy.

1080
01:08:20,883 --> 01:08:22,500
I think it's the eye design for them

1081
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,550
that really does it for me.

1082
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:30,750
I guess the main reason
why I don't like it

1083
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,466
this feels weird.

1084
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,766
OK, so what does it mean?

1085
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:38,883
Turning off the power? Do

1086
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,283
like I'm able to walk over here, ok?

1087
01:08:44,283 --> 01:08:46,500
All the TV is over the TV

1088
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,033
I'm going to come.

1089
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:53,433
Please do not come

1090
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,983
can we cuddle?

1091
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,266
I don't know.

1092
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,100
Are you all

1093
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:08,400
I can treat me to dinner first.

1094
01:09:11,883 --> 01:09:12,900
I bring this down.

1095
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,100
Shopping cart

1096
01:09:15,933 --> 01:09:17,933
well, I can't wait. Why?

1097
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,416
I cannot bring the shopping cart down bra.

1098
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:26,716
Oh, it doesn't want to go down

1099
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,766
look at it.

1100
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,700
Oh, now it's us.

1101
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,533
I was weird.

1102
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:33,516
Before.

1103
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,366
It was like it was being stuck on the on

1104
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:37,500
the slants.

1105
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:43,016
That's

1106
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:53,200
a really dumb OK.

1107
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,400
Now wait.

1108
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:03,100
Why was I was I not supposed to do that?

1109
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:09,566
Blah, blah, blah.

1110
01:10:16,616 --> 01:10:17,216
I guess.

1111
01:10:17,216 --> 01:10:19,766
I guess I had to use the cart.

1112
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:20,966
For what?

1113
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:24,216
To get a TV, maybe? Is that it?

1114
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:36,666
Hmm. Uh,

1115
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,550
all right, all right.

1116
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,650
I think I understand
what I have to do now.

1117
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:46,416
Once I turn the electricity back on

1118
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:50,500
to make the TV work,
I just got to park for my way.

1119
01:10:51,216 --> 01:10:53,133
So the shopping cart

1120
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,833
right

1121
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,383
and then I can turn the TV on

1122
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:03,600
and then go somewhere else.

1123
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,616
Easy peasy.

1124
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:13,233
Nice. OK.

1125
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:15,033
OK, you did it.

1126
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,150
Or is it going to bring us.

1127
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:30,783
Oh, what the fuck are we going? Oh.

1128
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:36,750
All the.

1129
01:11:37,216 --> 01:11:38,866
Why are there so many of you?

1130
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:40,000
Are they just doing their.

1131
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,416
They're just standing outside the fence
like they're ready to horde me.

1132
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:53,066
And I'll just

1133
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,416
let's just get away

1134
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:58,983
about that.

1135
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,350
Oh. Hmm.

1136
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:06,516
Oh, I see.

1137
01:12:06,516 --> 01:12:07,716
OK, we turn it off.

1138
01:12:07,716 --> 01:12:10,250
And then they're going to run down
over here and break open the.

1139
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:14,816
Break.

1140
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:16,500
Open the shop for me.

1141
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:21,466
You know.

1142
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:27,633
We know.

1143
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:28,150
They're not.

1144
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,533
Oh, now we can all run in to the

1145
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1146
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:39,516
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1147
01:12:44,216 --> 01:12:47,716
Oh, oh,

1148
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:49,450
oh, I'm sorry.

1149
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm sorry I interrupted your

1150
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,216
your cartoon network nickelodeon.

1151
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:56,366
I don't know what you're watching.

1152
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:57,633
Please don't kill me.

1153
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:05,366
You're in.

1154
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:07,600
No, no.

1155
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,966
You told us to do that.

1156
01:13:09,966 --> 01:13:11,400
You broke the TV.

1157
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,800
You fucking broke the TV.

1158
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:25,766
Oh, I'm

1159
01:13:25,766 --> 01:13:27,033
going to come

1160
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:31,600
yeah.

1161
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,233
We are away from them first try.

1162
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:37,466
I'd be happy about that, bro.

1163
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,016
First try.

1164
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,950
Zero deaths.

1165
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,250
Zero deaths.

1166
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:51,183
Oh, six.

1167
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,516
I'm going to get you out of there.

1168
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:56,666
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1169
01:14:05,516 --> 01:14:08,350
But why is he going to come after me now?

1170
01:14:12,483 --> 01:14:14,800
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

1171
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,650
ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1172
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:21,450
There's an there's an. Oh, my God.

1173
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,600
Oh, my God.

1174
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,733
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1175
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:25,750
Oh, my God. Oh, God. It's

1176
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,866
I did see the axe throw off

1177
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:33,033
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1178
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:35,916
Please, please don't grab me.

1179
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,900
Please don't grab me.
Please don't grab me. Give me a chance.

1180
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,966
Give me a chance. Oh, my God.
Give me a chance.

1181
01:14:39,966 --> 01:14:40,766
Holy shit.

1182
01:14:40,766 --> 01:14:41,766
He you give me a chance.

1183
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:43,150
What the fuck?

1184
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:52,283
Bobby's throwing.

1185
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,866
Or maybe he's playing with me.

1186
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,866
Oh, he's right on top.

1187
01:14:58,983 --> 01:15:00,366
I see you.

1188
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:01,866
I think he knows.

1189
01:15:01,866 --> 01:15:02,950
I see him

1190
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:17,916
like he knows I'm around oh.

1191
01:15:18,783 --> 01:15:22,433
Uh, Raul, uh.

1192
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:25,816
You're creepy.

1193
01:15:26,966 --> 01:15:29,700
That'd be a lot cooler for Dufus
with a fedora.

1194
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:30,900
Well, no,

1195
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,150
I don't like that hallway.

1196
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,400
I don't like all that hallways
looking right now.

1197
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,150
I don't like. It all, man.

1198
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,433
I don't like it. I don't like it.

1199
01:15:47,516 --> 01:15:48,333
I don't want it.

1200
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:51,066
I don't want.

1201
01:15:51,066 --> 01:15:52,450
I don't want it.
I don't want it. I don't. Want it.

1202
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:52,883
I don't want it.

1203
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:53,733
I don't want it

1204
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:56,916
why do you.

1205
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:57,783
He teleports.

1206
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:59,766
He fucking teleports

1207
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,783
did you see that shit?

1208
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:11,466
Was he got to.

1209
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:12,783
Teleport, man.

1210
01:16:12,783 --> 01:16:14,216
That's not fair.

1211
01:16:18,516 --> 01:16:20,366
We're on a train now.

1212
01:16:21,933 --> 01:16:23,066
I like that.

1213
01:16:23,616 --> 01:16:24,966
It's pretty cool.

1214
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:27,300
Oh, it's not cool
anymore. It's not cool anymore.

1215
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,050
He's here.

1216
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,166
How do you get here so fast?

1217
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:51,316
Oh, oh,

1218
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:54,250
my God. I think we're just.

1219
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,983
We're just better. We're faster.

1220
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:56,816
We're faster.

1221
01:16:56,816 --> 01:16:57,966
And better.

1222
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:04,816
You know, ow.

1223
01:17:06,216 --> 01:17:08,166
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1224
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,466
Oh, my God.

1225
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:14,500
What?

1226
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:18,783
Time.

1227
01:17:18,783 --> 01:17:20,766
Knock it away.

1228
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:22,716
What was that?

1229
01:17:22,716 --> 01:17:26,133
You saw the photos? I

1230
01:17:30,966 --> 01:17:31,800
I thought I got it.

1231
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,566
I flipped the switch and everything.

1232
01:17:49,716 --> 01:17:51,866
Oh, I had to flip even more.

1233
01:17:51,866 --> 01:17:54,266
OK, all right. Yes. Sucker

1234
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,850
by loser

1235
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,033
yeah.

1236
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,516
Plan life

1237
01:18:13,983 --> 01:18:16,316
speaking of trains, thanks for the hype.

1238
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:20,400
Train one.

1239
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,933
Oh, what a great sign.

1240
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:23,550
So I'll say thank you for that.

1241
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:29,966
I've train over on the train six

1242
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:34,233
why do we still see six

1243
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:37,450
for, like, guiding me

1244
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,383
or trying to guide me to.

1245
01:18:39,383 --> 01:18:41,066
I'm supposed to go

1246
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,000
on now.

1247
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,483
I'm fucked up

1248
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,216
he looks really hurt.

1249
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:54,566
Mano, you OK?

1250
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:57,033
You're not going to die on. Me, right?

1251
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:02,600
I ask.

1252
01:19:02,816 --> 01:19:07,000
Do the parallels on this reminds me of,
like, when we were playing the first game,

1253
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:11,483
like, walking down the aisle to the exit
i sex just sucking

1254
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,050
souls and stuff.

1255
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,066
Sex is a girl.

1256
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:21,150
I mean, I call everyone
bro or dude, regardless of

1257
01:19:21,566 --> 01:19:23,616
if you're a girl or not.

1258
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:25,950
It's gender neutral.

1259
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:30,450
It's nothing new.

1260
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,316
I've done it all the time.

1261
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:33,300
Yeah,

1262
01:19:36,633 --> 01:19:38,733
I'm really worried right now.

1263
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,966
Like he's not going to die right?

1264
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:20,800
Why we took our hat off her paper bag.

1265
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,683
Hat off

1266
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:29,066
oh, my God.

1267
01:20:29,066 --> 01:20:31,383
We're about to have our anime.

1268
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:32,350
Moments.

1269
01:20:36,016 --> 01:20:38,516
But the clock.

1270
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,516
Show, it's a psychic battle.

1271
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:43,050
It's like that show.

1272
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,316
You see a mob psycho.

1273
01:20:44,316 --> 01:20:45,700
All the time.

1274
01:21:05,133 --> 01:21:06,116
We're winning.

1275
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:06,716
Why the fuck are we.

1276
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:07,866
Winning, though?

1277
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,350
Why you dead.

1278
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:43,766
He started.

1279
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,950
To fucking kill them.

1280
01:22:08,816 --> 01:22:09,350
Oh, my God.

1281
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,783
Lam controlling the city.

1282
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,916
OK, Mano

1283
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,966
OK, Mano.

1284
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:40,800
You're pretty strong.

1285
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:50,000
Oh, I can't.

1286
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:52,050
I want to see his face

1287
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,300
That's impossible.

1288
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,583
I want to look at his face

1289
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,716
It's not going to let me, though, is it?

1290
01:23:01,716 --> 01:23:03,866
Now? I can't see anything

1291
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:07,266
yeah.

1292
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,300
All right.

1293
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:09,966
I'm gonna go get six back.

1294
01:23:09,966 --> 01:23:11,550
Yeah, I go save our friend.

1295
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,816
That's the last thing.

1296
01:23:12,816 --> 01:23:14,500
We killed the weird soul guy.

1297
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,883
With the fedora
who kind of reminds me of Frank Sinatra.

1298
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:20,616
But he's.

1299
01:23:20,616 --> 01:23:22,050
He doesn't. He's not Frank's.

1300
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:24,033
Dude, you know, he kind of does.

1301
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:28,666
Remind me of him
minus the, you know, the super powers

1302
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:29,850
that. Yes,

1303
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:35,050
like a psycho,

1304
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:38,333
like some kind of evil

1305
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:42,750
technology obsessed

1306
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:43,900
like Sinatra.

1307
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,483
So just sucker.

1308
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:48,216
So on to his TV world.

1309
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:50,800
And never stop singing Fly Me to the Moon.

1310
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,583
And New York.

1311
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:55,116
Is not a song that he sang.

1312
01:23:55,116 --> 01:23:57,566
Didn't he sing like

1313
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,633
I wanna be part of it?

1314
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,033
New York.

1315
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:03,866
Something like that.

1316
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:04,350
Right.

1317
01:24:08,983 --> 01:24:12,116
As I say,
this world is really fucking cool.

1318
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,950
This is the same music
from the first game.

1319
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,366
Oh, well,

1320
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:26,583
a lot

1321
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:34,900
I'm lagging.

1322
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,050
I don't think I'm lagging.
Everything seems fine.

1323
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:42,150
Just refresh your browser. On

1324
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,316
I think I got follow the music right

1325
01:25:02,516 --> 01:25:03,300
right.

1326
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:04,683
That seems to be the trick about this.

1327
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,133
We follow the where the music goes

1328
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,166
seems easy enough

1329
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:22,833
and we'll head towards us, I think.

1330
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:25,566
But what it's.

1331
01:25:29,816 --> 01:25:30,866
All the purple.

1332
01:25:30,866 --> 01:25:33,266
And pink, it just looks so goddamn pretty

1333
01:25:35,516 --> 01:25:37,116
it's a little it's a bit eerie.

1334
01:25:37,116 --> 01:25:42,100
So Plotz Barney runs this whole thing.

1335
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,816
God, no, please.

1336
01:25:44,816 --> 01:25:46,983
A fork. No,

1337
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,666
I never want to hear anything

1338
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:52,866
from that purple dinosaur ever again.

1339
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:01,466
Are these doors not hmm.

1340
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:06,483
Here we go.

1341
01:26:09,283 --> 01:26:10,700
How I.

1342
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:13,750
I supposed to get inside, though?

1343
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:17,133
Following me inside the door.

1344
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:20,216
You had to push this one open.

1345
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,950
I should push it open.

1346
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:28,016
Push it, push it open.

1347
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:38,216
Ah. OK.

1348
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:41,700
So instead, use the axe. We.

1349
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,600
I don't see an axe
around. Here is your knocks.

1350
01:26:49,566 --> 01:26:49,800
Yeah.

1351
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,450
Was just a really heavy door.

1352
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,666
God knows why

1353
01:26:55,866 --> 01:26:57,850
although I hope everyone here
is having a great morning

1354
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:00,366
so far
and gets check up on you of all that.

1355
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,716
Yes. Taking care of yourselves.

1356
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:04,766
Everything's chill.

1357
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:05,800
These good,

1358
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:08,866
very cosy, very comfy.

1359
01:27:08,866 --> 01:27:11,466
You got breakfast, dinner,

1360
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:15,116
have a nice beverage, maybe a snack.

1361
01:27:22,766 --> 01:27:26,066
Said milk. Nice

1362
01:27:27,633 --> 01:27:31,000
I think people or I do enjoy drinking.

1363
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,150
Just straight up milk.

1364
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:35,316
No, from a couple.

1365
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,766
I don't think that's bad.

1366
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:39,000
I know some people think it's weird

1367
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,550
gonna push this down.

1368
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:42,216
I think we need.

1369
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,616
We need to.
You. Let's come back over here.

1370
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,716
Not side

1371
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:51,933
Z today.

1372
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,116
Yeah, I had pancakes today.

1373
01:27:54,116 --> 01:27:56,950
I had pancakes and sausage and eggs.

1374
01:27:57,866 --> 01:27:59,733
Is really delicious.

1375
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:03,116
It's been

1376
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:06,266
have been since I had pancakes,
so I was really happy

1377
01:28:08,466 --> 01:28:12,300
any day I have pancakes is a good day.

1378
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:20,483
Here we are married

1379
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,833
I always.

1380
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:29,850
I think we made it oh.

1381
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,966
Wow. Six

1382
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:55,416
here.

1383
01:28:55,416 --> 01:28:56,850
You look a little different.

1384
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:59,583
Sex did you are. Did you get a manicure?

1385
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,550
Get a haircut, I think.

1386
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:03,816
Yeah. Haircut. You've.

1387
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:05,800
Have you been eating more?

1388
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:07,866
I know something of value

1389
01:29:07,866 --> 01:29:09,966
seems a little different.

1390
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,250
I think.

1391
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,866
I think you got a haircut.

1392
01:29:12,866 --> 01:29:14,766
I be sure you show me.

1393
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,116
Would you show me your music box now? OK.

1394
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:27,233
Oh, prosecutor call

1395
01:29:46,866 --> 01:29:47,166
me. Yes.

1396
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:48,116
I can't really see his face.

1397
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:49,033
It's all covered up.

1398
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:51,683
But up

1399
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:56,016
on the hill.

1400
01:29:56,066 --> 01:29:57,550
Oh, all right.

1401
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:00,250
That's a break. The box.

1402
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,616
I don't want him.

1403
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:04,300
She's going to get pissed at us.

1404
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,500
Hey, buddy.

1405
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,116
Buddy, I'm going to.

1406
01:30:12,116 --> 01:30:13,616
I'm going to do something.

1407
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,116
You come over here
and don't look all right?

1408
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:20,950
I know all about all of you.

1409
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:21,550
Just don't all.

1410
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,250
Fuck it, bro. OK, whatever.

1411
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,116
I guess we have to

1412
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,000
let's just say sorry.

1413
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,500
All I know say sorry now.

1414
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,366
Sorry.

1415
01:30:29,366 --> 01:30:32,800
Hey. What

1416
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:46,933
oh, oh, no.

1417
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:49,116
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. They'll run.

1418
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:51,183
I run and run the fuck away.

1419
01:30:51,366 --> 01:30:52,866
Just mad piss.

1420
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:54,366
Just piss

1421
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:56,700
I'm sorry.

1422
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,316
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
01:30:58,316 --> 01:31:00,966
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, bro.

1424
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:04,383
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Six.

1425
01:31:04,383 --> 01:31:05,816
I'm sorry.

1426
01:31:05,816 --> 01:31:06,783
Don't kill me.

1427
01:31:06,783 --> 01:31:07,983
No, I died.

1428
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:10,983
Oh, he died.

1429
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,300
She didn't kill. Me.

1430
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,383
I made my own death.

1431
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:15,250
Perception kills. Me.

1432
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,400
Hey. Hey, how about how about this?

1433
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,916
All right, how about after this?

1434
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:28,150
We we can go to McDonald's together,
all right?

1435
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,133
We can get.

1436
01:31:29,133 --> 01:31:31,266
I'll buy you the spicy chicken nuggets.

1437
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:33,116
You know, they came.
Those came back earlier.

1438
01:31:33,116 --> 01:31:35,283
Yeah, I can buy you some spicy
chicken nuggets.

1439
01:31:35,466 --> 01:31:36,900
Please, please don't hurt me

1440
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:38,950
and the McFlurry.

1441
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,866
I'll get you a McFlurry.

1442
01:31:43,266 --> 01:31:44,283
Oh, what.

1443
01:31:44,283 --> 01:31:45,900
Do you like? My place

1444
01:31:47,933 --> 01:31:48,633
all thorough.

1445
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:49,500
I'll throw now.

1446
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,650
I'll throw in some apple slices.

1447
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:51,350
Still

1448
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,750
why do you look so creepy?

1449
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,466
Look so goddamn creepy?

1450
01:32:14,816 --> 01:32:22,316
OK, oh, he.

1451
01:32:22,316 --> 01:32:23,283
Acts.

1452
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,983
I see that face right there.

1453
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:32,216
His goddamn weird

1454
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:37,300
yeah.

1455
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,450
Her arm is really creeping me out.

1456
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:42,566
I don't like how her arm looks

1457
01:32:45,033 --> 01:32:47,650
the fucking water from

1458
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,616
this. Oh.

1459
01:32:55,616 --> 01:32:57,933
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1460
01:32:57,933 --> 01:33:01,000
No, I was too small.

1461
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,066
Tell it.

1462
01:33:03,266 --> 01:33:06,216
Ok? I think I see why, guys, you know,

1463
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:08,700
I should call her
and then jump into the portal

1464
01:33:09,066 --> 01:33:11,350
and then go over there

1465
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:17,950
the other two.

1466
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,416
Slow there.

1467
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:19,200
Hold on.

1468
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,750
Nice job, mano.

1469
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:42,550
Is it that we keep going, though?

1470
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:46,050
It's like we transport ourselves
into another dimension for a second.

1471
01:33:49,116 --> 01:33:51,150
Wow. Oh,

1472
01:33:57,816 --> 01:33:59,350
oh. Where the fuck are we?

1473
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:01,450
There's another door here.

1474
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,683
Lots of breaking open doors with axes.

1475
01:34:08,766 --> 01:34:12,150
Is this like, is it
because this is how we first met sex like,

1476
01:34:12,366 --> 01:34:15,516
remember back in the house, we,
like, broke down the door, like,

1477
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:20,066
hey, let me ask you a question.

1478
01:34:21,183 --> 01:34:23,816
Is it like trying to remind us of.

1479
01:34:23,816 --> 01:34:25,316
That or something?

1480
01:34:40,766 --> 01:34:50,766
Hard that's really good.

1481
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:54,100
Yeah.

1482
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:57,333
I feel like that's the reason why

1483
01:34:59,516 --> 01:35:01,750
we keep seeing the door break and stuff.

1484
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,133
Go, hello.

1485
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:11,066
And get some more water oh,

1486
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,150
a quick water break because

1487
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:18,983
I didn't drink water a little bit

1488
01:35:21,033 --> 01:35:23,733
I keep my lips moist.

1489
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,433
And my and my throat lubricated.

1490
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:27,516
Of course.

1491
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:34,716
It's just more doors, more.

1492
01:35:34,716 --> 01:35:38,100
Doors open, doors
open, doors open, doors open, doors

1493
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:42,416
again.

1494
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,900
Who is my axe?

1495
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,100
Oh, there it is.

1496
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,650
Oh, can I get my axe back?

1497
01:35:55,650 --> 01:36:01,900
I oh, my God.

1498
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,533
How am I supposed to grab that shit?

1499
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,866
Fuck shit.

1500
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:11,433
I got smashed like a bargain.

1501
01:36:18,266 --> 01:36:18,900
Fuck me.

1502
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,400
Fuck me. No, no.

1503
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,283
Oh, dude, wait.

1504
01:36:24,266 --> 01:36:24,866
I think I see why.

1505
01:36:24,866 --> 01:36:25,866
Guys, you go.

1506
01:36:25,866 --> 01:36:26,700
Hold on.

1507
01:36:35,066 --> 01:36:38,166
No, Raul, I

1508
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:47,016
I died after I walked through the portal.

1509
01:36:47,216 --> 01:36:59,216
How No, no, no, no, no.

1510
01:36:59,216 --> 01:37:01,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. OK,

1511
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:13,500
nice.

1512
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,916
Oh, now.

1513
01:37:19,816 --> 01:37:21,816
That one was a little tricky.

1514
01:37:21,816 --> 01:37:24,700
A little bit a little bit trickier.

1515
01:37:39,066 --> 01:37:41,816
I'm sorry. Sex.

1516
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:46,566
Let me get up to you after after
this is over, ok?

1517
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,300
God, she's back.

1518
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,600
She's back.

1519
01:38:21,933 --> 01:38:25,116
Oh, she's back.

1520
01:38:25,116 --> 01:38:27,516
You're not you, and you're hungry.

1521
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,700
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1522
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,533
Of the entire place is breaking down.

1523
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:40,533
What is that?

1524
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:43,100
Oh, oh.

1525
01:38:43,233 --> 01:38:44,283
Oh, God.

1526
01:38:44,283 --> 01:38:46,500

01:38:47,283 --> 01:38:48,666
Hey, hey, hey.

1528
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:49,916
I want to help me.

1529
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,883
I'm a bit I'm the lost world where we are.

1530
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,650
And why that? What is that? What?

1531
01:38:56,666 --> 01:38:59,850
Why is it drawn to Jesus word?

1532
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:09,916
Is this a tower thing?

1533
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,700
Why is it tower looks so fucking.

1534
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,900
Weird for

1535
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:19,116
I don't know.

01:40:17,216 --> 01:40:19,483
Fuck you.

1543
01:40:20,316 --> 01:40:22,316
I knew I was going.

1544
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:25,383
I knew somebody was going to do that.

1545
01:40:25,383 --> 01:40:28,300
Oh, why

1546
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,150
oh, I yell back.

1547
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:37,766
Stabs, brawl. Mm.

1548
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,700
No, we're stuck in the goop.

1549
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,166
It looks like it looks like a brain

1550
01:40:49,983 --> 01:40:51,933
I can't even see my face either.

1551
01:40:51,933 --> 01:40:52,650
Still

1552
01:40:56,816 --> 01:40:57,750
I was cold as fuck.

1553
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:58,416
It was cold

1554
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:01,600
I don't know why she did it.

1555
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,316
Still

1556
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:08,766
where we're going.

1557
01:41:09,266 --> 01:41:10,200
She's a lover.

1558
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,000
She has a lover or not a lover.

1559
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,816
I mean, are we all over

1560
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,133

1561
01:41:17,133 --> 01:41:19,116
We're alive.

1562
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,766
But I don't know how alive.

1563
01:41:32,616 --> 01:41:35,733
I stop on the I it's so fucking creepy.

1564
01:41:37,316 --> 01:41:37,916
Yeah,

1565
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:40,833
whose eyes are those?

1566
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:42,400
What are you.

1567
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:22,266
Oh. I can't walk.

1568
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,966
I'm stuck

1569
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,800
chilling here.

1570
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,433
By myself, and I'll have sex.

1571
01:42:30,433 --> 01:42:32,850
Say more, my friend.

1572
01:42:33,716 --> 01:42:37,316
I just have that weird eye monster.

1573
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:17,250
We're getting older.

1574
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,600
A lot older.

1575
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,883
On how much time is passed
or if this is, like, happening

1576
01:43:21,216 --> 01:43:22,716
really quickly.

1577
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:30,416
Oh, oh, yeah.

1578
01:43:45,783 --> 01:43:48,183
We got we got a Frank Sinatra.

1579
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:53,166
No. No.

1580
01:44:07,683 --> 01:44:09,783
This entire time, we were the hot man.

1581
01:44:09,866 --> 01:44:17,666
I don't completely understand it, but I

1582
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:21,183
we're just him.

1583
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,800
That's us.

1584
01:44:38,366 --> 01:44:40,300
I know why I like

1585
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:43,883
how we're creepy guy,
but at the same time, you like

1586
01:44:45,633 --> 01:44:47,466
that bird from the TV and.

1587
01:44:47,466 --> 01:44:50,700
Shit, but ok.

1588
01:44:53,466 --> 01:44:54,850
And that's it.

1589
01:44:57,266 --> 01:44:58,300
Michael Jackson.

1590
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,200
Shut up.

1591
01:45:01,233 --> 01:45:02,500
Moves on.

1592
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:09,266
Oh. We kiss more

1593
01:45:15,516 --> 01:45:18,150
there's more. Wow.

1594
01:45:20,516 --> 01:45:21,033
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:45:21,033 --> 01:45:22,650
All right. Six escapes.

1596
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,850
Hey, how's it feel to be a trader, huh?

1597
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:25,416
How's it feel.

1598
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:29,433
To be a cold hearted fucking backstabbing

1599
01:45:29,433 --> 01:45:32,433
traitor? Sex

1600
01:45:34,983 --> 01:45:58,166
what are you hungry?

1601
01:45:58,766 --> 01:46:00,750
Yeah, right.

1602
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:06,633
That's

1603
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:09,783
literally what starts the next part
for a little nightmares.

1604
01:46:09,783 --> 01:46:10,866
One I think

1605
01:46:13,316 --> 01:46:16,983
she gets that never ending hunger

1606
01:46:17,816 --> 01:46:22,383
oh, wow. Wow.

1607
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,416
This game.

1608
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:28,416
Gives me. Chills every single time.

1609
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:33,483
It gives me so much chills
just thinking about that conclusion.

1610
01:46:33,816 --> 01:46:39,666
It's so fucking cool. Man.

1611
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,916
This game is really good.

1612
01:46:41,916 --> 01:46:43,766
It's really fucking good. I think.

1613
01:46:45,116 --> 01:46:48,100
I think I'm willing to say it's better.

1614
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:51,150
It's one of the rare times, like the

1615
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:55,316
the sequel does feel like better
than the original.

1616
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,933
It's. It's like some degrees, right?

1617
01:46:58,766 --> 01:47:01,600
Because there's just a lot more content

1618
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,683
is more story and like the

1619
01:47:04,383 --> 01:47:07,016
the spooks are spookier

1620
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:11,666
like all numbers
one is also like really good too.

1621
01:47:11,666 --> 01:47:15,283
But this is like
you know they outdid themselves the one

1622
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:19,983
they really did outdid themselves

1623
01:47:29,583 --> 01:47:33,816
so the honest lesson

1624
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:35,950
is it really.

1625
01:47:43,016 --> 01:47:44,166
And that.

1626
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,433
Was little nightmares till

1627
01:47:48,783 --> 01:47:50,466
we're going to move on to our next game.

1628
01:47:50,466 --> 01:47:55,833
Don't go anywhere because
I'm about to move on so home sweet home.

1629
01:47:55,833 --> 01:47:56,733
Next.

1630
01:47:59,883 --> 01:48:00,550
Yeah.

1631
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,816
That's our next game with the night
we're finishing

1632
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:07,000
yeah.

1633
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,866
I'm not going to. Go anywhere.
Just yet. We got another game.

1634
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,750
Because again, like I said,
I really want to finish home sweet home

1635
01:48:20,133 --> 01:48:21,450
and see a

1636
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:27,233
see the conclusions of that game as well,
since we have like two more hours

1637
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,616
left of the Oklahoma City home,
I think right.

1638
01:48:31,983 --> 01:48:33,716
God, I can't wait.

1639
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:36,116
Dude, I've been thinking about it all day
yesterday.

1640
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:41,016
The Short by Bandai

1641
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:45,900
you can skip this.

1642
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,800
Hold on.

1643
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,933
Yeah, actually, I'll,

1644
01:48:51,933 --> 01:48:54,266
I'll see you through the entire credits.

1645
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:57,616
In the meantime, on

1646
01:48:58,166 --> 01:48:59,966
we should do I miss the lady?

1647
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:04,533
No, I honestly fuck the she is creepy.

1648
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:08,850
She is soul guards down creepy man.

1649
01:49:11,316 --> 01:49:12,250
The box cutter.

1650
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,416
I don't even know that was box cutter.

1651
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:16,050
I thought it was a screwdriver.

1652
01:49:19,616 --> 01:49:22,450
That's why I like click so much like

1653
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:25,350
that. She's just, like,
moving it up and down.

1654
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:26,100
Up and down.

1655
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,550
For some reason, I
thought it was a screwdriver in her hand,

1656
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:31,866
and it was her
that was like doing the clicking

1657
01:49:40,233 --> 01:49:41,066
the little nightmares,

1658
01:49:41,066 --> 01:49:44,350
two game team, producer, executive team.

1659
01:49:44,616 --> 01:49:48,666
They did a great job, and I hope
they make a little nightmare story.

1660
01:49:48,866 --> 01:49:49,766
I feel like they will.

1661
01:49:49,766 --> 01:49:52,950
There's so much like, you know,
good feedback for low numbers, too.

1662
01:49:53,016 --> 01:49:56,066
I don't like why wouldn't
they make a number three, right?

1663
01:49:56,516 --> 01:49:59,433
And maybe they can make a multiplayer

1664
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,116
I think they can do it

1665
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,900
and make me really happy.

1666
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:10,000
Maybe it doesn't have to be a six,
but it could be a different like

1667
01:50:10,466 --> 01:50:12,450
set of characters

1668
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:16,500
and just getting to play a multiplayer for
this kind of game would be really cool,

1669
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:20,816
cool for Friend, and I really hope
that they consider doing that.

1670
01:50:21,183 --> 01:50:23,916
Like at least
have it as an option to do multiplayer

1671
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:29,316
Oh. I've ever played Puppy Playtime.

1672
01:50:29,316 --> 01:50:32,366
I heard Chapter two for the game came out,
but I'm not sure

1673
01:50:32,366 --> 01:50:33,983
if I want to do it

1674
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:37,016
because I don't know if

1675
01:50:37,016 --> 01:50:39,266
like they still I don't know if like,

1676
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:43,950
you know, ideal

1677
01:50:45,116 --> 01:50:47,766
I'll think about it, I'll think about it
because like not sure

1678
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:50,883
if the supporters still like, you know, do

1679
01:50:50,883 --> 01:50:52,916
NFC and stuff

1680
01:50:55,016 --> 01:50:57,750
or like the creators
of the company mature.

1681
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:01,050
That's a look into that and see what's up.

1682
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:03,483
If not, then OK, maybe I'll consider
playing it, but we'll see

1683
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:13,316
OK, now give me a second, y'all.

1684
01:51:13,316 --> 01:51:16,116
I'm going to quickly uh,

1685
01:51:17,466 --> 01:51:20,816
quickly announce on the server
that we're going to transition over

1686
01:51:20,816 --> 01:51:25,233
it's home sweet home because I think some
people want to be pinged for that game

1687
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:31,766
I like
for a bit because I'm, I'm tabbed out.

1688
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,616
At. Everyone

1689
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:38,950
moving.

1690
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:42,066
It's a home sweet home now.

1691
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:46,233
We finished little nightmares still.

1692
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:51,416
So now we're going to move on
to our second

1693
01:51:51,866 --> 01:51:56,283
game of the nights
and finish that off for today.

1694
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:59,400
See, as soon

1695
01:52:04,416 --> 01:52:09,366
OK, OK.

1696
01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:12,550
I think I think that one thorough

1697
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,816
all right.

1698
01:52:23,883 --> 01:52:25,766
But in the meantime,
so you guys should probably

1699
01:52:25,766 --> 01:52:29,133
go and grab yourself
some some snacks and drinks, right?

1700
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,033
But let me see.

1701
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:41,800
There's no place.

1702
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,316
Like home

1703
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:46,500
is no place like home.

1704
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,483
There's no place like home.

1705
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,750
Pass it home sweet

1706
01:52:56,766 --> 01:53:00,066
home. OK,

1707
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:05,883
close out of that, OK?

1708
01:53:07,566 --> 01:53:08,500
Yeah. Well, thank you, guys.

1709
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,350
For watching through a little nightmares
,too.

1710
01:53:11,650 --> 01:53:13,500
We're going to be moving on
to our next game.

1711
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,533
So where is Home Sweet Home?

1712
01:53:16,866 --> 01:53:17,433
where the fuck is it?

1713
01:53:18,816 --> 01:53:19,533
Hello?

1714
01:53:24,366 --> 01:53:25,383
Is really nice getting

1715
01:53:25,383 --> 01:53:28,466
to, like, refresh myself and live through
that whole adventure again.

1716
01:53:28,466 --> 01:53:30,566
So thanks for

1717
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,716

1718
01:53:33,716 --> 01:53:34,683

01:53:36,866 --> 01:53:37,716
with me as well.

1720
01:53:37,716 --> 01:53:40,716
You know, like bought up some puzzles.

1721
01:53:44,616 --> 01:53:46,083
Oh my God.

1722
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:47,883
Here we go again.

1723
01:53:47,883 --> 01:53:53,400
Here we fucking go.

1724
01:54:04,166 --> 01:54:04,566
I thought.

1725
01:54:04,566 --> 01:54:06,683
Wait. One more thing I forgot to do.

1726
01:54:06,683 --> 01:54:08,250
Let me check , ah

1727
01:54:09,966 --> 01:54:11,683
And let me check

1728
01:54:12,816 --> 01:54:15,083
this caught one more time,
and then we should be fine.

1729
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:17,616
And look,

1730
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,383
I totally recommend, like, if you've never

1731
01:54:21,383 --> 01:54:24,233
if you've never played little nightmares
before, right?

1732
01:54:24,683 --> 01:54:25,950
Like the first one.

1733
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:28,016
And this is like your first introduction
to this series,

1734
01:54:28,283 --> 01:54:30,116

1735
01:54:30,116 --> 01:54:32,616
playing the first one yourselves
or playing the second one on your own.

1736
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:34,466
If you liked what
you saw and support the game

1737
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:38,483
All right.

1738
01:54:38,483 --> 01:54:40,283

I think we can continue
or do chapter select

1748
01:55:19,416 --> 01:55:21,966
hopeless circle the nightmare begins.

1749
01:55:24,383 --> 01:55:25,716
Oh am I missing something.

1750
01:55:25,716 --> 01:55:27,983
It says I'm missing.
A collectable item or whatever.

1751
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:30,533
OK I said and finding whatever that was

1752

01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:41,933
or continue

1755
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,716
I think it's saved everything.

1756
01:55:45,716 --> 01:55:46,050
Right?

1757
01:55:47,483 --> 01:55:48,333
We'll see.

1758
01:55:50,183 --> 01:55:51,683
Oh yeah, it does.

1759
01:55:51,983 --> 01:55:56,100
Oh, well, no, I hear again.

1760
01:55:56,316 --> 01:56:00,150
Oh, I fucking hear her again.

1761
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,166
Jesus,

1762
01:56:03,683 --> 01:56:06,000
the bump up the volume a little bit

1763
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,233
and then get right into this mess.

1764
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:19,233
The cutter sound.

1765
01:56:19,233 --> 01:56:21,866
Yeah, OK.

1766
01:56:22,883 --> 01:56:26,066
The guys remember what we have to do.

1767
01:56:26,783 --> 01:56:28,350
What's our objective here?

1768
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:29,966
Do we follow the

1769
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:31,416
the strings?

1770
01:56:31,416 --> 01:56:32,000
Right?

1771
01:56:42,566 --> 01:56:43,533
She there?

1772
01:56:43,533 --> 01:56:45,566
Oh, no.

1773
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:47,466
We follow the string.

1774
01:56:47,466 --> 01:56:49,983
Where is the string lead us?

1775
01:57:03,933 --> 01:57:04,833
it's going to there's

1776
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:07,716
there's some string inside here.

1777
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:12,616
Oh, man.

1778
01:57:14,883 --> 01:57:18,300
Wow. Oh, no.

1779
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:20,833
Na na na na na, bro.

1780
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:24,050
Well, what is

1781
01:57:29,283 --> 01:57:32,700
oh. Shit.

1782
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:35,466
OK, we're out on more.

1783
01:57:36,366 --> 01:57:39,083
My God.

1784
01:57:46,916 --> 01:57:47,366
All right.

1785
01:57:47,366 --> 01:57:51,383
I guess we'll
maybe we can just find the one over here

1786
01:57:51,383 --> 01:57:53,816
instead since she's in that area.

1787
01:57:54,516 --> 01:57:56,550
All right,
let's follow the string here first,

1788
01:57:57,533 --> 01:57:59,216
see where it goes.

1789
01:58:02,166 --> 01:58:04,416
There's no way she's going to show up
here, right?

1790
01:58:04,416 --> 01:58:05,183
Right.

1791
01:58:13,733 --> 01:58:14,066
Oh, yeah.

1792
01:58:14,066 --> 01:58:15,750
I have the key for it.

1793
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:21,633
Now, why does the source.

1794
01:58:25,716 --> 01:58:31,700
Lock fuck

1795
01:58:35,516 --> 01:58:39,183
know she showed off from the portal

1796
01:58:41,583 --> 01:58:47,433
ah

1797
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,133
That's

1798
01:59:05,433 --> 01:59:06,083
all right.

1799
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:09,083
All right, we're good. We're good.

This alone.

1807
01:59:59,633 --> 02:00:02,066

to be there to

1808
02:00:06,683 --> 02:00:07,733

It's over here.

1816
02:00:58,166 --> 02:01:00,366

02:01:11,633 --> 02:01:13,716

Look away, please. So I can go.

02:02:12,516 --> 02:02:13,716
So I can run

1829
02:02:19,983 --> 02:02:20,483

1830
02:02:20,483 --> 02:02:22,516

02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:45,533
I'm paranoid, man.

1837
02:02:57,266 --> 02:02:58,716
I think we're fine.

1838
02:03:00,266 --> 02:03:01,533
I just got to take it slowly.

1839
02:03:01,533 --> 02:03:03,533
Take it nice and slow. Nice and slow , shoto.

1840
02:03:03,583 --> 02:03:05,700
All right?
There's no need to rush anything.

1841
02:03:05,933 --> 02:03:09,683
You just got to be more patient sometimes

1842
02:03:26,466 --> 02:03:29,933
I don't even want to go down there
just yet.

1843
02:03:32,483 --> 02:03:35,250
You just come back around.

1844
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:38,933
Oh, don't do that.

You want to save me?

1930
02:12:14,933 --> 02:12:18,066
Then why are you stabbing me for
box cutter. Huh?

1931
02:12:18,983 --> 02:12:20,600
I don't think that's saving me. I think.

1932
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:22,833
I think that's trying to kill me.

1933
02:12:22,833 --> 02:12:26,466
I think you have a very different idea

1934
02:12:26,466 --> 02:12:28,566
about saving me.

1935
02:12:31,133 --> 02:12:32,583
Oh, God.

1936
02:12:39,816 --> 02:12:40,883

We got one candle.

1941
02:13:00,783 --> 02:13:07,416
Now what .

1942
02:13:07,616 --> 02:13:09,183
It was back here

1943
02:13:10,116 --> 02:13:13,050
a piece of a mysterious photograph.

1944
02:13:16,533 --> 02:13:17,333
And boxes.

1945
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:19,616
I made it,

1946
02:13:19,616 --> 02:13:21,666
but we still have more candles to burn.

1947
02:13:22,733 --> 02:13:24,600
Yeah, I'll go find them.

1948
02:13:26,783 --> 02:13:28,233
It's not over.

1949
02:13:28,233 --> 02:13:32,333
Shit. here it is. OK.

Hold on.

1952
02:13:40,433 --> 02:13:41,883
Is there more?

1953
02:13:47,216 --> 02:13:47,783
But we?

1954
02:13:47,783 --> 02:13:49,866
Well, we burned it already, didn't we?

1955
02:13:50,516 --> 02:13:53,166
Is there another candle in there?

1956
02:14:00,416 --> 02:14:05,183
Are is there another candle in here
that we have to burn?

1957
02:14:05,183 --> 02:14:06,516
I don't know.

1958
02:14:06,683 --> 02:14:10,466
There is ? Fuck.

Oh, oh, oh.

1961
02:14:32,166 --> 02:14:32,766
Please. Sorry.

1962
02:14:32,766 --> 02:14:36,183
I don't want to burn the candle again.

1963
02:14:38,833 --> 02:14:41,133
Emotional damage.

1964
02:14:43,783 --> 02:14:46,650
God, she's fast. Man.

1965
02:14:46,883 --> 02:14:49,716
I hate how fast she is.

1966
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:53,616
I'm going to go check.

1967
02:14:53,616 --> 02:14:54,450
I think.

1968
02:14:55,133 --> 02:14:57,183
I think we have to burn it again.

1969
02:14:57,183 --> 02:14:59,583

How did she find me?

1978
02:16:00,233 --> 02:16:02,933
I was crouched down and everything was OK
because she saw me walk.

1979
02:16:02,933 --> 02:16:04,433

We got it this time.

1983
02:16:23,516 --> 02:16:24,866
You're cringe.

1984
02:16:24,866 --> 02:16:27,816
Hey, you lady.

1985
02:16:27,816 --> 02:16:29,183
You're cringe.

1986
02:16:39,216 --> 02:16:39,783
This was not

1987
02:16:39,783 --> 02:16:41,700
where I was supposed to go.

1988
02:17:03,666 --> 02:17:05,283
I'm. I'm hiding this time

1989
02:17:05,283 --> 02:17:17,066
so you can't see me, right? Oh.

1990
02:17:17,733 --> 02:17:20,583
How, how,

1991
02:17:20,583 --> 02:17:22,800
how, no.

1992
02:17:26,483 --> 02:17:27,983
Bro, I,

1993
02:17:27,983 --> 02:17:30,533
i walk out the locker
and he's already ready

1994
02:17:30,533 --> 02:17:32,516
on my arse.

1995
02:17:35,133 --> 02:17:35,400
Okay.Should I

1996
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:35,766
wait for him.

1997
02:17:35,766 --> 02:17:37,316
to turn around

1998
02:17:48,033 --> 02:17:51,650
a few moments later,

1999
02:17:59,616 --> 02:17:59,966
come on.

2000
02:17:59,966 --> 02:18:02,616
Turn, turn already.

2001
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:10,016
Cringe, cringe, cringe,

2002
02:18:10,016 --> 02:18:12,000
cringe, cringe.

2003
02:18:34,416 --> 02:18:35,816
Now that's one candle.

2004
02:18:35,816 --> 02:18:38,066
Is there another candle in here?

2005
02:18:38,066 --> 02:18:41,700
Somebody please help me, because I'm
not sure if there's another one or not.

2006
02:18:43,733 --> 02:18:46,500
Hmm? Somebody

2007
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:49,416
tell me, is there another
a candle inside this room?

2008
02:18:49,683 --> 02:18:51,183
Inside this room?

2009
02:18:51,183 --> 02:18:52,416
I know there's other candles

2010
02:18:52,416 --> 02:18:54,566
in like the other areas
that we had to concern too, so.

2011
02:18:54,566 --> 02:18:56,783
But is there more here?

2012
02:18:56,783 --> 02:18:58,833
I think that was it right

2013
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:01,566
oh, that's it.

2014
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:05,450
Then why did I come back here? I

2015
02:19:17,483 --> 02:19:19,583
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

2016
02:19:28,166 --> 02:19:29,816
Then I got trolled.

2017
02:19:29,816 --> 02:19:31,566
I got trolled.

2018
02:19:32,783 --> 02:19:34,133
Somebody said that there was another.

2019
02:19:34,133 --> 02:19:36,966
One in here, and I believe them.

2020
02:19:50,516 --> 02:19:52,200
Let's just wait for it to go out, and.

2021
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,933
And then we can . Wait she turns around.

2022
02:19:55,266 --> 02:19:57,633
No, she doesn't. OK,

2023
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:00,766
that's just.

2024
02:20:11,516 --> 02:20:11,916
That's OK.

2025
02:20:11,916 --> 02:20:12,416
You can go.

2026
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,566
You can go.

2027
02:20:34,016 --> 02:20:34,833
Oh, my God.

2028
02:20:34,833 --> 02:20:36,900
She got you, You

2029
02:20:38,483 --> 02:20:40,100
get the fuck out

2030
02:20:42,416 --> 02:20:42,983
all right?

2031
02:20:42,983 --> 02:20:45,083
We're done with this place.

2032
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:47,666
Get the hell out of here now. Let's go

2033
02:20:50,366 --> 02:20:52,916
let's go to the next spot.

2034
02:20:52,916 --> 02:20:54,366
Next spot.

2035
02:20:55,716 --> 02:20:56,366
you look for?

2036
02:20:56,366 --> 02:20:57,450
You look cool as new.

2037
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:59,333
They the love school. Yeah.

2038
02:20:59,333 --> 02:21:01,016
Let's see a love school.

2039
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:04,866
All right.

2040
02:21:10,233 --> 02:21:10,616
OK, now

2041
02:21:10,616 --> 02:21:12,866
that's a find the candle in this area.

2042
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:19,016
We were already here before,
but she caught us last time.

2043
02:21:19,016 --> 02:21:19,800
I think

2044
02:21:25,333 --> 02:21:25,650
yeah,

2045
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,083
I still hear her

2046
02:21:34,683 --> 02:21:36,866
she has her little shrimps

2047
02:21:36,866 --> 02:21:39,383
watching the hallway too.

2048
02:21:51,666 --> 02:21:53,700
she can come over here.

2049
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:57,300
Are you going to go back

2050
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:59,216
or you gonna come over here?

2051
02:22:01,916 --> 02:22:04,016
Oh, doesn't look like she has

2052
02:22:04,866 --> 02:22:06,116
watch it everywhere.

2053
02:22:06,116 --> 02:22:07,283
It's almost like she's trying.

2054
02:22:07,283 --> 02:22:12,150
I think she's trying to prevent us from,
you know, bringing the candles out.

2055
02:22:12,516 --> 02:22:21,233
So fuck,

2056
02:22:21,433 --> 02:22:24,366
I really wish we had more incense.

2057
02:22:24,366 --> 02:22:26,316
That's what lures them away, right?

2058
02:22:26,316 --> 02:22:27,450
Ha ha ha ha.

2059
02:22:31,383 --> 02:22:33,700
Oh, no. Oh,

2060
02:22:34,733 --> 02:22:37,583
oh, oh.

2061
02:22:37,583 --> 02:22:39,600
She saw me oh.

2062
02:22:43,266 --> 02:22:46,200
That's so lame.

2063
02:22:48,083 --> 02:22:50,316
How does she see me?

2064
02:22:54,966 --> 02:22:57,116
Oh, oh.

2065
02:23:04,133 --> 02:23:05,283
All right.

2066
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:06,216
Yeah.

2067
02:23:06,216 --> 02:23:08,616
I got stabbed again.

2068
02:23:19,950 --> 02:23:21,683
Oh, I'm dead.

2069
02:23:21,783 --> 02:23:23,816
I'm so dead. I'm
so dad. It's not even funny

2070
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:24,866
how dead I am.

2071
02:23:25,883 --> 02:23:26,783
Wait, wait,

2072
02:23:27,633 --> 02:23:29,066
wait, wait,

2073
02:23:29,433 --> 02:23:30,783
wait. What?

2074
02:23:30,783 --> 02:23:31,866
I'm alive.

2075
02:23:32,066 --> 02:23:32,733
What?

2076
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:36,350
What?

2077
02:23:37,533 --> 02:23:38,733
alive?

2078
02:23:39,116 --> 02:23:40,500
Oh, boy.

2079
02:23:43,216 --> 02:23:45,633
This is my birthday. Yes.

2080
02:23:57,066 --> 02:24:00,416
She was just teasing me.

2081
02:24:07,233 --> 02:24:08,133
Well,

2082
02:24:09,450 --> 02:24:11,966
I don't like being teased like that. It's

2083
02:24:18,083 --> 02:24:20,916
ok. OK, ok, ok.

2084
02:24:20,916 --> 02:24:22,650
OK. OK.

2085
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:24,833
You were slick. Were really slick.

2086
02:24:24,833 --> 02:24:26,633
We're slick right now.

2087
02:24:35,633 --> 02:24:36,533
Oh, there it is.

2088
02:24:36,533 --> 02:24:37,966
Is that the. Candle?

2089
02:24:37,966 --> 02:24:39,183
Eh? No, that's not the candle.

2090
02:24:39,183 --> 02:24:39,783
What's

2091
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:44,516
where is the fucking candle then?

2092
02:24:46,233 --> 02:24:47,283
Are you the candle?

2093
02:24:47,283 --> 02:24:49,083
Oh, your incense

2094
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:55,283
oh, my God.

2095
02:24:55,283 --> 02:24:57,833
How am I supposed to get to
that? Is that it down there?

2096
02:24:59,883 --> 02:25:01,266
Where's the incense, bro?

2097
02:25:01,266 --> 02:25:03,900
I don't know where the incense is at.

2098
02:25:14,350 --> 02:25:16,200
that was the incense.

2099
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,716
Yeah, I'm trying to put it inside.

2100
02:25:18,716 --> 02:25:20,883
I don't have any
to put any inside, though.

2101
02:25:35,783 --> 02:25:37,983
Well, maybe there's some in the bathroom.

2102
02:25:37,983 --> 02:25:39,183
It's a ground.

2103
02:25:41,583 --> 02:25:43,650
Yeah, there are some in the bathroom.

2104
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:45,600
We got incense. OK, cool, cool, cool.

2105
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,966
We can get them out the hallway now.

2106
02:25:47,966 --> 02:25:49,183
My God,

2107
02:25:50,816 --> 02:25:52,800
thank fuck for that.

2108
02:26:00,266 --> 02:26:03,266
OK, let's get them out of the hallway.

2109
02:26:06,450 --> 02:26:07,950
He smells it

2110
02:26:10,016 --> 02:26:11,633
nice.

2111
02:26:13,716 --> 02:26:15,033
Oh, thank God.

2112
02:26:15,033 --> 02:26:15,683
Oh, there's another.

2113
02:26:15,683 --> 02:26:16,833
One right here.

2114
02:26:25,566 --> 02:26:26,016
I see. Help.

2115
02:26:26,016 --> 02:26:29,433
So why are they so obsessed
with it, though?

2116
02:26:35,966 --> 02:26:36,866
It's like a lure.

2117
02:26:36,866 --> 02:26:37,766
Yeah.

2118
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,700
Oh, oh,

2119
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:49,133
oh, oh.

2120
02:26:50,766 --> 02:26:52,916
OK. Oh.

2121
02:26:54,366 --> 02:26:55,616
Nice.

2122
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:58,016
Now we got to get the fuck out of here.

2123
02:26:58,016 --> 02:26:59,883
That's true. That's two candles down

2124
02:27:07,666 --> 02:27:11,183
here. And

2125
02:27:21,266 --> 02:27:21,966
don't look in her.

2126
02:27:21,966 --> 02:27:22,766
Please don't walk in here.

2127
02:27:22,766 --> 02:27:24,883
Please don't look in here plz don't look in here.Er.

2128
02:27:25,383 --> 02:27:28,616
Oh. Oh, oh, oh,

2129
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:30,833
dude.

2130
02:27:32,466 --> 02:27:33,933
I think she came and saw the bathroom.

2131
02:27:33,933 --> 02:27:36,750
Otherwise,
I would've heard all the breathing

2132
02:27:56,433 --> 02:27:58,083
so distracted by it.

2133
02:27:58,083 --> 02:28:00,900
Is it like drugs or something?

2134
02:28:22,916 --> 02:28:32,250
Turn around.

2135
02:28:38,166 --> 02:28:40,350
Oh, shit.

2136
02:28:40,733 --> 02:28:42,600
Oh, shit.

2137
02:28:42,866 --> 02:28:45,383
Oh, my God.

2138
02:28:48,116 --> 02:28:50,616
I got the incense in there,
so I think we're fine.

2139
02:28:51,416 --> 02:28:55,350
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

2140
02:28:56,316 --> 02:28:57,900
Oh, dear

2141
02:28:57,900 --> 02:28:59,733
god, bro.

2142
02:28:59,733 --> 02:29:02,666
That's so fucking scary.

2143
02:29:07,733 --> 02:29:08,316
Close.

2144
02:29:08,316 --> 02:29:09,083
Yeah.

2145
02:29:15,516 --> 02:29:16,233
I try to do that

2146
02:29:16,233 --> 02:29:19,233
to get her out of hallway, but

2147
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:28,350
she turned around.

2148
02:29:28,350 --> 02:29:34,783
she is, oh.

2149
02:29:36,483 --> 02:29:38,100
See those so close?

2150
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:40,233
They are so close. Holy shit.

2151
02:29:40,983 --> 02:29:43,583
Why would she go.

2152
02:29:51,783 --> 02:29:53,933
Where am I. I am

2153
02:29:55,266 --> 02:29:56,816
nowhere near you, that's for sure.

2154
02:30:05,366 --> 02:30:07,783
No, close that door now.

2155
02:30:36,183 --> 02:30:37,566
some of you're gone

2156
02:30:42,783 --> 02:30:43,800
I think she's gone.

2157
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,066
I think she's gone.

2158
02:30:46,166 --> 02:30:48,683
Now I hear the box cutter.

2159
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,783
I don't want to leave the locker.

2160
02:30:50,783 --> 02:30:52,283
Dude. I'm scared.

2161
02:30:53,433 --> 02:30:56,366
I don't know if she's
going to come in here or not.

2162
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:01,983
I think she's trying to trick
me, like, oh.

2163
02:31:01,983 --> 02:31:02,966
No, it's totally OK, shoto.

2164
02:31:02,966 --> 02:31:05,133
I'm not looking at you.

2165
02:31:05,133 --> 02:31:07,116
I'm not trying to look for you.

2166
02:31:08,633 --> 02:31:09,250
You can come out.

2167
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:10,783
The locker now.

2168
02:31:12,716 --> 02:31:13,583
I'm not going to kill you.

2169
02:31:13,583 --> 02:31:14,666
Shoto.

2170
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,966
Oh, she's not here, dude.

2171
02:31:19,966 --> 02:31:21,266
Do anything. I did it.

2172
02:31:21,716 --> 02:31:22,283
Oh, my God.

2173
02:31:22,283 --> 02:31:24,750
I think we did it. We did it.

2174
02:31:25,583 --> 02:31:26,316
We're looking at it.

2175
02:31:26,316 --> 02:31:28,583
OK, let's get the hell out of here.

2176
02:31:31,566 --> 02:31:45,750
Oh, oh.

2177
02:31:50,766 --> 02:31:51,966
Is this the last place that.

2178
02:31:51,966 --> 02:31:52,800
We have to go to?

2179
02:31:54,116 --> 02:31:54,483
I swear

2180
02:31:54,483 --> 02:31:57,783
to God, I thought we were here before.

2181
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:00,800
Are we not here already?

2182
02:32:10,833 --> 02:32:14,133
I think we're already here.

2183
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,216


2184
02:32:33,566 --> 02:32:36,066
OK, and now we have one more candle

2185
02:32:36,066 --> 02:32:38,566
right? just one more.

2186
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,950
head in spirit.

2187
02:32:43,950 --> 02:32:45,216
Was this

2188
02:32:47,733 --> 02:32:50,916
all the way over that one before

2189
02:32:53,133 --> 02:32:53,933
I don't think.

2190
02:32:53,933 --> 02:32:57,383
Oh, I don't think we got the red
threatening candles from this area yet.

2191
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:59,483
So let's look around

2192
02:33:00,533 --> 02:33:02,400
oh. All right.

2193
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,966
This should be the last one, right?

2194
02:33:03,966 --> 02:33:05,700
Because there's only three,

2195
02:33:05,883 --> 02:33:06,383
is there

2196
02:33:06,383 --> 02:33:07,583
only three

2197
02:33:12,966 --> 02:33:14,333
I don't know.

2198
02:33:18,516 --> 02:33:20,250
Or were there more.

2199
02:33:27,750 --> 02:33:30,300
Because there's it looks like
there's more threats, Donna, missing.

2200
02:33:30,366 --> 02:33:31,866
I don't know where it's from.

2201
02:33:31,866 --> 02:33:34,016
Oh, here it wait on some down here.

2202
02:33:34,833 --> 02:33:37,316
How do you get over here? Door

2203
02:33:38,366 --> 02:33:39,500
elevator

2204
02:33:41,183 --> 02:33:42,233
let's take the elevator.

2205
02:33:47,250 --> 02:33:50,850
The portable. Crox's without the r,

2206
02:33:52,283 --> 02:33:54,983
so Cox?

2207
02:33:58,316 --> 02:33:59,516
the third floor.

2208
02:33:59,516 --> 02:34:08,616
Yeah, that's
where I'm going right now. No.

2209
02:34:09,116 --> 02:34:12,716
Oh you know, it is the third floor right

2210
02:34:13,833 --> 02:34:16,533
all this doesn't look so good.

2211
02:34:19,533 --> 02:34:22,283
Broadcasting room, broadcasting room.

2212
02:34:22,533 --> 02:34:25,116
Let's go to a broadcasting room.

2213
02:34:26,316 --> 02:34:26,850
Mm hmm.

2214
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:35,616
There's, like, red threads.

2215
02:34:35,616 --> 02:34:36,116
What?

2216
02:34:36,983 --> 02:34:38,800
What? Huh?

2217
02:34:41,116 --> 02:34:42,216
Was that

2218
02:34:46,433 --> 02:34:47,416
what?

2219
02:34:49,616 --> 02:34:50,816
They just can play noises.

2220
02:34:50,816 --> 02:34:53,733
Like that and like that.

2221
02:34:53,933 --> 02:34:54,716
Try to scare me.

2222
02:34:54,716 --> 02:34:56,816
Dude, that's not cool.

2223
02:35:04,983 --> 02:35:05,400
I don't think

2224
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:07,733
this is where we're supposed to go.

2225
02:35:08,483 --> 02:35:10,016
You know, the broadcasting room's lots.

2226
02:35:10,016 --> 02:35:13,316
I only we have the key for that are like

2227
02:35:13,316 --> 02:35:15,116
an access.

2228
02:35:16,716 --> 02:35:17,633
Oh, no, we do.

2229
02:35:17,633 --> 02:35:19,166
We do have the key. What?

2230
02:35:19,166 --> 02:35:20,433
I'm just dumb.

2231
02:35:23,033 --> 02:35:24,983
Attention, attention.

2232
02:35:24,983 --> 02:35:27,266
Rumours spreading around the campus
about a

2233
02:35:28,716 --> 02:35:31,083
about a senior committing suicide.

2234
02:35:31,083 --> 02:35:32,400
In the engineering building.

2235
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:33,033
Mm hmm.

2236
02:35:33,266 --> 02:35:36,150
Please be aware that it was a hope.

2237
02:35:36,150 --> 02:35:40,733
Everyone please remain calm
and do not spread further

2238
02:35:40,733 --> 02:35:41,366
rumours.

2239
02:35:42,833 --> 02:35:46,016
Thank you for your cooperation.

2240
02:35:47,883 --> 02:35:51,533
OK, I,

2241
02:35:51,933 --> 02:35:54,333
that's kind of cre...

2242
02:35:55,416 --> 02:35:58,883
Oh, God.

2243
02:35:58,983 --> 02:36:01,266
Oh, my fucking God.

2244
02:36:01,266 --> 02:36:03,416
Holy shit.

2245
02:36:04,116 --> 02:36:07,800
Oh, oh, oh.

2246
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:12,533
So oh, no.

2247
02:36:13,283 --> 02:36:18,116
why why oh, fuck you.

2248
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:20,366
Game.

2249
02:36:22,716 --> 02:36:26,433
I was just as I was really uncomfortable
like nothing bad was going to happen.

2250
02:36:26,583 --> 02:36:26,883
It is.

2251
02:36:26,883 --> 02:36:29,883
Throw that shit in front of me.

2252
02:36:30,233 --> 02:36:31,133
Oh, shit.

2253
02:36:31,133 --> 02:36:34,666
OK, no,

2254
02:36:35,666 --> 02:36:37,133
this isn't a rumour.

2255
02:36:37,133 --> 02:36:38,766
Yeah, that's not a rumour.

2256
02:36:38,766 --> 02:36:43,683
Literate just happened ok?

2257
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:50,966
I think that's what I should be.

2258
02:36:50,966 --> 02:36:52,583
All of them, right?

2259
02:36:57,816 --> 02:37:06,216
Oh, man,

2260
02:37:06,483 --> 02:37:08,883
this game's unhealthy for my, for my heart.

2261
02:37:12,366 --> 02:37:14,450
Oh fuck with

2262
02:37:14,666 --> 02:37:16,116
what's down there.

2263
02:37:17,133 --> 02:37:19,283
We been down there before.

2264
02:37:20,233 --> 02:37:22,200
You don't think
you got any red threads down there, right?

2265
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:24,066
I think that's everything.

2266
02:37:25,050 --> 02:37:27,266
I believe, right?

2267
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:30,233
What about the fourth floor?

2268
02:37:33,333 --> 02:37:35,066
Also, thank you for another drink.

2269
02:37:35,066 --> 02:37:38,666
Guys, thank you so much for the hygiene

2270
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:40,283
I love you.

2271
02:37:41,633 --> 02:37:42,983
I love my guldies.

2272
02:37:42,983 --> 02:37:44,483
Thank you so much.

2273
02:37:45,416 --> 02:37:47,550
No, I think on the fourth floor,
it looks like

2274
02:37:48,750 --> 02:37:51,033
there's a blood portal here

2275
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:57,900
I hate abandoned schools, man.

2276
02:38:00,783 --> 02:38:03,833
The vibes are atrocious.

2277
02:38:09,883 --> 02:38:10,233
Oh, yeah.

2278
02:38:10,233 --> 02:38:11,483
We've definitely already been here.

2279
02:38:11,483 --> 02:38:13,533
We don't need to be here anymore.

2280
02:38:13,533 --> 02:38:13,833
I know.

2281
02:38:13,833 --> 02:38:16,083
Poke my head around just in case. Nope.

2282
02:38:16,083 --> 02:38:16,800
Nothing

2283
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:19,800
yeah.

2284
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,066
Let's go back down.

2285
02:38:21,066 --> 02:38:22,616
I think we finished

2286
02:38:27,133 --> 02:38:27,450
at least.

2287
02:38:27,450 --> 02:38:29,733
I'm pretty sure we did suck.

2288
02:38:30,383 --> 02:38:32,133
You suck.

2289
02:38:37,683 --> 02:38:41,066
So let's go
and see if the candles are good.

2290
02:38:49,766 --> 02:38:50,750
Hello?

2291
02:38:51,116 --> 02:38:51,966

2292
02:38:51,966 --> 02:38:53,700
Oh, it's open.

2293
02:38:56,700 --> 02:39:00,716
Oh. Oh, why?

2294
02:39:07,566 --> 02:39:09,966
Oh, I don't like this.

2295
02:39:10,433 --> 02:39:11,733
I don't like this one bit.

2296
02:39:11,733 --> 02:39:12,566
Guys,

2297
02:39:15,566 --> 02:39:16,266
what is this?

2298
02:39:19,016 --> 02:39:20,366
I can't grab it.

2299
02:39:20,366 --> 02:39:20,766
Why not?

2300
02:39:20,766 --> 02:39:21,666
Let me grab it.

2301
02:39:21,666 --> 02:39:22,250
What's

2302
02:39:24,666 --> 02:39:26,333
what's this supposed to be?

2303
02:39:26,333 --> 02:39:27,966
It's like meets?

2304
02:39:32,583 --> 02:39:33,266
good luck?

2305
02:39:33,266 --> 02:39:35,316
What do you mean good luck?

2306
02:39:39,483 --> 02:39:39,983
It's locked.

2307
02:39:39,983 --> 02:39:41,066
You have to get it opened.

2308
02:39:41,066 --> 02:39:44,733
How? does use my hands

2309
02:39:46,616 --> 02:39:49,250
all these are a lot of things

2310
02:39:50,133 --> 02:39:52,133
that it doesn't let me grab.

2311
02:39:52,383 --> 02:39:53,933
For some reason.

2312
02:40:01,466 --> 02:40:02,216
A lot of them.

2313
02:40:02,216 --> 02:40:03,600
Oh, hey,

2314
02:40:04,566 --> 02:40:05,583
what's this?

2315
02:40:05,633 --> 02:40:06,900
Only water

2316
02:40:07,383 --> 02:40:10,566
above holy water. POG

2317
02:40:11,550 --> 02:40:12,450
oh. Where am I

2318
02:40:12,450 --> 02:40:15,083
supposed to use the holy water, huh?

2319
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:19,200
On these things?

2320
02:40:22,583 --> 02:40:28,116
Why uh, do I make myself, like,
a safe zone?

2321
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:44,066
Uh, oh, ok.

2322
02:40:44,066 --> 02:40:44,466
I get it.

2323
02:40:44,466 --> 02:40:46,566
Now I understand

2324
02:40:51,033 --> 02:41:00,266
uh, why is it giving me

2325
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:03,933
is it like these are a lot of, like,

2326
02:41:03,933 --> 02:41:07,433
spots
you know, to try to make me feel safe?

2327
02:41:07,433 --> 02:41:08,133
I don't know.

2328
02:41:13,583 --> 02:41:15,783
I feel
like a boss if I is going to show up,

2329
02:41:17,466 --> 02:41:18,366
you know,

2330
02:41:21,683 --> 02:41:24,450
it's kind of like instincts

2331
02:41:25,916 --> 02:41:27,383
and sticks at my my boss fight.

2332
02:41:27,383 --> 02:41:28,800
Instincts are coming kicking in.

2333
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:29,883
At the moment.

2334
02:41:31,566 --> 02:41:36,416
No way.

2335
02:41:36,416 --> 02:41:44,550
What was that?

2336
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:46,466
Now I need to deal.

2337
02:41:46,466 --> 02:41:49,050
And once I get what I have to do, then

2338
02:41:49,050 --> 02:41:51,083
oh, hey there.

2339
02:41:51,083 --> 02:41:52,583
A hacksaw.

2340
02:41:56,483 --> 02:41:56,983
Right?

2341
02:41:59,883 --> 02:42:02,066
So sorry, sorry, sorry,

02:42:02,433 --> 02:42:04,683

Oh, yikes.

02:42:39,116 --> 02:42:40,350
OK. I think I understand

2349
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:42,083
why I have to do now.

2350
02:42:51,666 --> 02:42:54,600
I think to use the hacksaw slowly
to get out of here

2351
02:42:55,083 --> 02:42:58,383
and try to, like, avoid her

2352
02:43:04,650 --> 02:43:40,350
she doesn't know oh.

2353
02:43:41,366 --> 02:43:46,583
This dude.

2354
02:43:46,650 --> 02:43:47,550
What?

2355
02:43:47,633 --> 02:43:49,916
What up?

2356
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:52,733
Stop, stop.

2357
02:43:57,666 --> 02:43:59,100
Oh, I don't like that music.

2358
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:01,200
I don't like that music doing that.

2359
02:44:08,966 --> 02:44:09,816
I'm so fucked.

2360
02:44:09,816 --> 02:44:11,566
I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked up.

2361
02:44:11,566 --> 02:44:15,066
Both my good.

2362
02:44:16,083 --> 02:44:17,633
Hey, I'm here, I'm here. Disappear.

2363
02:44:17,633 --> 02:44:19,683
Come over here and disappear.

2364
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:24,283
OK? OK, ok.

2365
02:44:24,283 --> 02:44:26,016
Now I have a chance to.

2366
02:44:26,016 --> 02:44:26,966
Cut more

2367
02:44:27,866 --> 02:44:29,850
those happening time.

2368
02:44:33,966 --> 02:44:49,433
Pop oh.

2369
02:44:50,750 --> 02:44:52,466
Oh. This is bad.

2370
02:44:52,466 --> 02:44:54,816
This is really bad.

2371
02:44:57,183 --> 02:45:00,700
Oh,

2372
02:45:22,266 --> 02:45:22,916
oh, fuck.

2373
02:45:22,916 --> 02:45:26,133
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

2374
02:45:26,133 --> 02:45:27,816
No, no, no.

2375
02:45:27,816 --> 02:45:29,816
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I have holy water.

2376
02:45:29,816 --> 02:45:31,650
I have the power of holy water on my side.

2377
02:45:31,650 --> 02:45:33,633
You can't hurt me now.

2378
02:45:43,716 --> 02:45:44,566
Wait,

2379
02:45:45,183 --> 02:45:45,450
wait.

2380
02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:47,066
Why is it not working?

2381
02:45:48,266 --> 02:45:49,350
Well, you want

2382
02:46:00,716 --> 02:46:02,133
it doesn't work anymore.

2383
02:46:02,133 --> 02:46:04,233
What if it wasn't gonna work anymore?

2384
02:46:04,233 --> 02:46:07,750
Laughs My holy water I.

2385
02:47:18,266 --> 02:47:20,016
She hear that.

2386
02:47:21,966 --> 02:47:22,433
Oh, my God.

2387
02:47:22,433 --> 02:47:24,300
I think she does hear it.

2388
02:47:41,883 --> 02:47:43,316
Stop counting it.

2389
02:47:43,316 --> 02:47:45,783
Go somewhere else. Leave me alone.

2390
02:47:50,616 --> 02:47:53,016
Does she know where I am?

2391
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:02,733
I think she does.

2392
02:48:02,733 --> 02:48:04,233
Yeah, it was.

2393
02:48:04,233 --> 02:48:04,866
Why was she?

2394
02:48:04,866 --> 02:48:07,183
We should be moving like that.

2395
02:48:16,533 --> 02:48:18,183
Oh, yeah.

2396
02:48:18,183 --> 02:48:19,433
I'm safe here.

2397
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:23,283
We won't know.

2398
02:48:23,283 --> 02:48:25,133
Not what?

2399
02:48:25,583 --> 02:48:26,666
I'm confused.

2400
02:48:26,666 --> 02:48:28,116
What was that?

2401
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:39,416
Oh, no.

2402
02:48:39,966 --> 02:48:41,516
Get off of me. Get off of me!

2403
02:48:41,516 --> 02:48:42,833
Get off of me.

2404
02:48:49,050 --> 02:48:51,066
Why? Why, why?

2405
02:48:51,366 --> 02:48:54,116
Why, why?

2406
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:57,066
Why didn't you work that time?

2407
02:49:06,833 --> 02:49:09,000
Oh, God, this is bad.

2408
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,583
Oh, sorry,

2409
02:49:14,350 --> 02:49:16,833
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2410
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:36,933
I'm not even halfway done.

2411
02:49:36,933 --> 02:49:37,766
Yeah,

2412
02:49:38,616 --> 02:49:40,466
that sucks, man.

2413
02:50:06,266 --> 02:50:06,833
You think it has?

2414
02:50:06,833 --> 02:50:07,533
It's high.

2415
02:50:07,533 --> 02:50:09,616
I don't think so.

2416
02:50:10,950 --> 02:50:12,816
I doubt it does.

2417
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:33,983
Let's just hurry up.

2418
02:50:33,983 --> 02:50:36,450
Let's just hurry up and get some done.

2419
02:50:59,383 --> 02:51:05,450
I'm I think she hears us

2420
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:11,566
oh, hold on.

2421
02:51:11,566 --> 02:51:14,916
I think you should lower down the
the music, though, just a tad bit.

2422
02:51:16,466 --> 02:51:18,900
So it's not like too obnoxious.

2423
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:21,183
So we're going to be here for a bit.

2424
02:51:46,733 --> 02:51:48,566
Yeah, ok.

2425
02:51:48,566 --> 02:51:51,283
OK, ok. Punk pocket, pocket,
pocket, pocket.

2426
02:51:51,633 --> 02:51:52,583
I've time now. I have time.

2427
02:51:52,583 --> 02:51:54,216
I have time, I have time.

2428
02:52:20,283 --> 02:52:24,066
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. No.

2429
02:52:25,166 --> 02:52:27,083
No, don't.

2430
02:52:27,083 --> 02:52:30,866
Oh. Why?

2431
02:52:32,016 --> 02:52:35,250
How did she get me that time?

2432
02:52:35,766 --> 02:52:39,416
Oh, oh, oh.

2433
02:52:41,316 --> 02:52:42,083
No way.

2434
02:52:42,083 --> 02:52:43,650
It's gonna make me redo it.

2435
02:52:43,650 --> 02:52:46,016
It's gonna make me fucking redo it.
This game is cruel.

2436
02:52:46,166 --> 02:52:46,616
This game is.

2437
02:52:46,616 --> 02:52:50,216
So. Cruel. Why

2438
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:53,466
oh, son of a bitch.

2439
02:52:53,466 --> 02:52:55,616
Dude, this isn't.

2440
02:52:55,616 --> 02:52:57,150
This is not going to be easy.

2441
02:52:57,150 --> 02:52:59,883
All this is hard.

2442
02:53:00,966 --> 02:53:03,416
I'm going to learn to despise that chick.

2443
02:53:04,416 --> 02:53:09,966
I all right.

2444
02:53:12,966 --> 02:53:16,866
I just want to try again.

2445
02:53:17,100 --> 02:53:17,666
I listen.

2446
02:53:17,666 --> 02:53:19,683
I know, like, fully what to do now.

2447
02:53:19,683 --> 02:53:21,833
It's just going to be difficult.

2448
02:53:22,350 --> 02:53:24,116
You know, it's going
to be fucking difficult to

2449
02:53:25,866 --> 02:53:27,666
get away from her

2450
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:31,433
or trying to avoid her
while we saw away at it.

2451
02:53:31,683 --> 02:53:34,566
It's just such a serious thing
to sort through, though.

2452
02:53:35,916 --> 02:53:38,066
Do we even have this all?

2453
02:53:38,066 --> 02:53:41,483
Well, was saw it

2454
02:53:46,233 --> 02:53:46,650
all right.

2455
02:53:46,650 --> 02:53:47,300
There

2456
02:53:50,333 --> 02:53:51,983
I believe this time, I think we can.

2457
02:53:51,983 --> 02:53:54,533
We can do it now. We can do it this time.

2458
02:53:54,533 --> 02:53:55,733
Easy, easy peasy.

2459
02:53:55,733 --> 02:53:57,000
Easy peasy.

2460
02:53:58,566 --> 02:54:00,766
Side by

2461
02:54:01,800 --> 02:54:12,233
side now.

2462
02:54:17,916 --> 02:54:20,216
Sorry, sorry, sorry,

2463
02:54:20,216 --> 02:54:22,416
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2464
02:54:35,033 --> 02:54:40,233
Uh, I was.

2465
02:54:40,233 --> 02:54:41,133
Opening.

2466
02:55:12,150 --> 02:55:13,850
Oh, I see.

2467
02:55:15,333 --> 02:55:16,116
Hey, look at me.

2468
02:55:16,116 --> 02:55:18,216
Look at me, look at me.

2469
02:55:23,550 --> 02:55:25,283
OK, ok.

2470
02:55:48,933 --> 02:55:51,900
OK. Now I know where to

2471
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:53,216
trap her.

2472
02:55:55,266 --> 02:55:56,400
Proper.

2473
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:58,083
Proper

2474
02:56:11,316 --> 02:56:13,516
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

02:56:13,883 --> 02:56:17,033

02:56:23,316 --> 02:56:24,150
Sorry.

2479
02:56:34,316 --> 02:56:34,566
Fuck.

2480
02:56:34,566 --> 02:56:37,133
What the fuck?
What the fuck? What the fuck?

2481
02:56:38,116 --> 02:56:50,583
Go on oh.

2482
02:56:52,100 --> 02:57:04,383
Oh. Oh. Yes.

2483
02:58:02,633 --> 02:58:03,233
Fuck.

2484
02:58:04,083 --> 02:58:10,350
Hop the fuck.

2485
02:58:10,350 --> 02:58:11,616
Out of here.

2486
02:58:13,233 --> 02:58:14,166
I think we did it.

2487
02:58:14,166 --> 02:58:15,266
I think what you need.

2488
02:58:15,266 --> 02:58:18,683
To do it no.

2489
02:58:18,866 --> 02:58:20,583
Or holy.

2490
02:58:20,583 --> 02:58:23,283
Water is holy water.

2491
02:58:24,916 --> 02:58:29,133
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

2492
02:58:30,533 --> 02:58:30,966
You're.

2493
02:58:30,966 --> 02:58:31,500
We did it.

2494
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:34,783
Let's go. OK.

2495
02:58:36,533 --> 02:58:37,950
Oh, fuck.

2496
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:40,333
Yeah. Hmm.

2497
02:58:41,066 --> 02:58:41,733
I told you.

2498
02:58:41,733 --> 02:58:42,266
I told you.

2499
02:58:42,266 --> 02:58:44,483
Second try second try. Easy peasy.

2500
02:58:45,150 --> 02:58:46,383
Not even worried, bro.

2501
02:58:46,383 --> 02:58:48,533
Not even worried.

2502
02:58:49,950 --> 02:58:55,366
God, I guess
like luring her as far away from block.

2503
02:58:55,500 --> 02:58:56,283
Stop.

2504
02:58:57,600 --> 02:58:58,316
Oh, God.

2505
02:58:58,316 --> 02:58:59,766
Oh, no.

2506
02:59:01,583 --> 02:59:03,683
Bitch. No,

02:59:06,300 --> 02:59:08,216
All Oh, this is bad.

2509
02:59:08,216 --> 02:59:10,016
This is really bad.

2510
02:59:12,983 --> 02:59:13,766
Well,

02:59:17,333 --> 02:59:19,666

2512
02:59:20,066 --> 02:59:22,083

2516
02:59:39,316 --> 02:59:40,900
Is that her?

2517
02:59:40,966 --> 02:59:41,966
Is I her lover?

2518
02:59:41,966 --> 02:59:42,866
I don't. Know.

2519
02:59:42,866 --> 02:59:44,183
OK, ok.

Yeah, yeah. Better get out of here, man.

2532
03:00:22,583 --> 03:00:24,950
The dagger given to me by the novice monk

2533
03:00:25,650 --> 03:00:27,816
some might have thought
I was being gullible about this.

2534
03:00:28,616 --> 03:00:31,283
I had to keep it away from him.

2535
03:00:31,283 --> 03:00:34,516
Behind
the cupboard would tell that someone help.

2536
03:00:34,516 --> 03:00:36,666
Then I do it all by myself,

2537
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:39,900
if not gone crazy.

2538
03:00:43,316 --> 03:00:44,466
Forgot about Jane.

2539
03:00:44,466 --> 03:00:45,416
How can you forget about Jane?

2540
03:00:45,416 --> 03:00:46,050
She's the entire.

2541
03:00:46,050 --> 03:00:47,733
Reason we're here.

2542
03:00:53,283 --> 03:00:56,100
I really don't think this was worth it,
bruh.

2543
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:57,183
Mika.

2544
03:00:57,183 --> 03:01:00,116
Mika, your kind of go vigil for me. Go.

2545
03:01:00,116 --> 03:01:01,166
Thank you so much for the read.

2546
03:01:01,166 --> 03:01:04,166
Me ga of your shameless good. All gone.

2547
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:05,133
Assault, assault.

2548
03:01:08,366 --> 03:01:08,733
I see you're

2549
03:01:08,733 --> 03:01:11,250
also trying to string more often
on on switch as well.

2550
03:01:11,883 --> 03:01:14,216
Guys,
if you don't know mika, she's also another

2551
03:01:15,083 --> 03:01:17,516
another friend of mine,
so go check out her consensual.

2552
03:01:17,550 --> 03:01:22,166
She streams on both youtube and such,
but I don't think as much on switch

2553
03:01:22,166 --> 03:01:24,483
just mostly youtube.
So yeah, give her follow.

2554
03:01:24,900 --> 03:01:26,516
Thank you for the ride
and hope your stream was good.

2555
03:01:26,516 --> 03:01:29,366
There we are. Just avoided.

2556
03:01:30,083 --> 03:01:33,116
Lady with knife murdering us.

2557
03:01:34,733 --> 03:01:35,183
By the way.

2558
03:01:35,183 --> 03:01:37,233
I'm not a dog

2559
03:01:38,916 --> 03:01:39,366
as a woman.

2560
03:01:39,366 --> 03:01:40,616
Make that clear.

2561
03:01:40,766 --> 03:01:42,083
See, it's. It's not.

2562
03:01:42,083 --> 03:01:43,466
It's not real. It's just.

2563
03:01:43,466 --> 03:01:44,666
It's just. Ha ha. Funny.

2564
03:01:44,666 --> 03:01:45,450
Ha, dog.

2565
03:01:45,450 --> 03:01:48,266
Ha you know it there for a second.

2566
03:01:48,750 --> 03:01:51,083
Um, I'm a regular boy

2567
03:01:53,083 --> 03:01:53,700
named Paul.

2568
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:56,316
Nice to meet you there on that's new here.

2569
03:01:56,833 --> 03:01:57,300
I'll come.

2570
03:01:58,433 --> 03:01:59,883
I'm playing a horror game today,

2571
03:01:59,883 --> 03:02:02,966
so if you can't stomach horror,
then I'd say,

2572
03:02:04,116 --> 03:02:05,133
watch out.

2573
03:02:05,933 --> 03:02:06,816
Because it's pretty spooky.

2574
03:02:06,816 --> 03:02:09,516
So I'm paid for that.
I put it on for free.

2575
03:02:09,783 --> 03:02:10,733
I put it on for free.

2576
03:02:10,733 --> 03:02:12,033
Nobody paid for it.

2577
03:02:12,033 --> 03:02:14,466
Why are you talking about I?

2578
03:02:14,516 --> 03:02:16,683
Larry, put it on
at the beginning of the screen. You can't.

2579
03:02:17,333 --> 03:02:19,283
You guys are gas lighters.

2580
03:02:19,283 --> 03:02:21,033
I got my shot.

2581
03:02:21,033 --> 03:02:22,133
What is wrong? My shell.

2582
03:02:22,133 --> 03:02:24,216
You guys are gas lighters.

2583
03:02:24,216 --> 03:02:25,766
What the heck?

2584
03:02:26,883 --> 03:02:29,366
Put it back. No,

2585
03:02:29,366 --> 03:02:30,533
no, I won't.

2586
03:02:30,533 --> 03:02:31,916
I won't see that

2587
03:02:35,366 --> 03:02:36,533
you're going to buy a gun.

2588
03:02:36,533 --> 03:02:38,516
I gave it to you for free for 3 hours.

2589
03:02:38,516 --> 03:02:41,100
OK, so awesome.

2590
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:44,216
Wait, where are we going, dude?

2591
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:45,683
Where the fuck are we?

2592
03:02:45,683 --> 03:02:46,050
It feels like

2593
03:02:46,050 --> 03:02:49,316
we've been going through a, like, endless
loop on this bridge this entire time.

2594
03:02:50,016 --> 03:02:50,883
On this catwalk.

2595
03:02:53,483 --> 03:02:56,400
My crazy how

2596
03:03:06,533 --> 03:03:09,000
I only put on for 3 hours.

2597
03:03:09,516 --> 03:03:10,133
That's your limit.

2598
03:03:10,133 --> 03:03:11,933
It's been 3 hours.

2599
03:03:13,316 --> 03:03:16,316
If you want to walk again,
then you're going to use your manifests.

2600
03:03:16,766 --> 03:03:18,566
I don't know what to say.

2601
03:03:22,266 --> 03:03:24,533
My decision is final.

2602
03:03:27,383 --> 03:03:29,183
Licence, said Barak.

2603
03:03:29,183 --> 03:03:30,150
Fuck you.

2604
03:03:31,083 --> 03:03:32,400
Motherfucker.

2605
03:03:37,233 --> 03:03:39,750
There's a lot more red threads
showing up, dude.

2606
03:03:39,750 --> 03:03:42,900
I don't know. OK, som someone bought it.

2607
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:43,683
OK, there you go.

2608
03:03:43,683 --> 03:03:44,700
There you go.

2609
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:48,066
I know who it was,

2610
03:03:48,066 --> 03:03:51,216
but I guess that's manna fruits
well spent.

2611
03:03:51,816 --> 03:03:52,650
I think

2612
03:03:57,750 --> 03:03:59,900
it's so goddamn quiet here.

2613
03:04:02,016 --> 03:04:04,800
Am I am I even going the right way?

2614
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:07,983
I mean, there's only one way to go.

2615
03:04:09,283 --> 03:04:11,283
There's so many red strings

2616
03:04:19,133 --> 03:04:21,366
awesome behind me.

2617
03:04:29,516 --> 03:04:32,033
Maybe this is intended.

2618
03:04:32,183 --> 03:04:33,033
Hold on.

2619
03:04:37,733 --> 03:04:40,250
The students spirit

2620
03:04:45,333 --> 03:04:45,983
please cover up.

2621
03:04:45,983 --> 03:04:47,233
That's so sassy of the daughter.

2622
03:04:47,233 --> 03:04:49,466
It is only more about its engine
became major news

2623
03:04:49,716 --> 03:04:51,650
last time
because of the death of one student.

2624
03:04:51,650 --> 03:04:53,583
It must not be the
same. The same. Thank you.

2625
03:04:56,466 --> 03:04:57,683
Is this like

2626
03:04:57,683 --> 03:05:00,033
everything
related to that lady that we saw

2627
03:05:10,566 --> 03:05:12,216
yeah. OK.

2628
03:05:12,216 --> 03:05:15,516
I just want to see if I was missing
anything.

2629
03:05:18,266 --> 03:05:19,466
Is it quiet?

2630
03:05:19,716 --> 03:05:20,850
I don't know.

2631
03:05:20,900 --> 03:05:22,283
Why is it quiet then?

2632
03:05:22,283 --> 03:05:24,566
Walking for a while. So

2633
03:05:35,100 --> 03:05:35,483
what?

2634
03:05:35,483 --> 03:05:38,250
Who's happy over home

2635
03:05:38,250 --> 03:05:40,116
or back home?

2636
03:05:40,566 --> 03:05:41,816
Hello?

2637
03:05:41,966 --> 03:05:43,983
Jane,
you back here? It's toilet paper. Why?

2638
03:05:43,983 --> 03:05:47,700
Why do we have toilet paper on
the on the table?

2639
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:52,283
Is Tim like, you know, into

2640
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,433
exhibitionism?

2641
03:05:55,433 --> 03:05:56,150
I'm just kidding.

2642
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:58,866
I don't know. I'm trying to imply there.

2643
03:05:58,866 --> 03:06:00,600
I can't even bring this up.

2644
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:07,950
It's all tied down
from the red thread. Tim.

2645
03:06:08,550 --> 03:06:11,250
Oh, it's me again. Hey,

2646
03:06:11,250 --> 03:06:13,283
since your wife's disappearance, you

2647
03:06:15,266 --> 03:06:17,966
you seem a bit strange.

2648
03:06:18,083 --> 03:06:20,816
You don't act like yourself lately.

2649
03:06:20,816 --> 03:06:23,133
We're we're we're friends.

2650
03:06:23,133 --> 03:06:24,833
Aren't we? Mm hmm.

2651
03:06:24,833 --> 03:06:26,850
If you need to talk to
someone, I'm here. All right?

2652
03:06:28,166 --> 03:06:28,833
That's a good friend.

2653
03:06:28,833 --> 03:06:30,983
Me back. I'm worried.

2654
03:06:31,950 --> 03:06:33,683
That's a real good friend.

2655
03:06:36,966 --> 03:06:38,516
Tim. Oh.

2656
03:06:38,516 --> 03:06:40,716
It's me again. Depressed again. My bad.

2657
03:06:40,716 --> 03:06:42,783
Since your wife's disappearance, you

2658
03:06:44,733 --> 03:06:47,483
you seem a bit strange.

2659
03:06:47,583 --> 03:06:50,316
You don't act like yourself lately.

2660
03:06:50,316 --> 03:06:51,683
We're all.

2661
03:06:51,683 --> 03:06:54,300
What's with the knives? On the fridge?
What's.

2662
03:06:54,300 --> 03:06:55,950
If you need to talk to someone, I'm here.

2663
03:06:55,950 --> 03:06:56,733
All right.

2664
03:06:57,650 --> 03:06:59,816
Please call me back.

2665
03:06:59,816 --> 03:07:01,083
I'm worried.

2666
03:07:03,150 --> 03:07:05,333
OK? I think we all go upstairs,

2667
03:07:05,466 --> 03:07:08,483
and it seems like that's the next spot.

2668
03:07:08,783 --> 03:07:09,866
You don't have to see that.

2669
03:07:09,866 --> 03:07:11,066
Like we're done with that.

2670
03:07:11,066 --> 03:07:16,533
Those other spirits right Jane

2671
03:07:20,250 --> 03:07:20,900
Mm hmm.

2672
03:07:24,383 --> 03:07:26,483
The door's still there.

2673
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:32,816
Why am I worried?

2674
03:07:33,633 --> 03:07:36,200
Oh, my going so worried for

2675
03:07:37,916 --> 03:07:38,733
I think that's the only door

2676
03:07:38,733 --> 03:07:40,416
we can go through.

2677
03:07:44,616 --> 03:07:45,066
This is it.

2678
03:07:45,066 --> 03:07:47,366
Home? Yeah. Home, sweet home.

2679
03:07:47,883 --> 03:07:48,966
All of this in our home.

2680
03:07:53,666 --> 03:07:54,983
Lowell,

2681
03:07:58,266 --> 03:07:59,633
hello.

2682
03:08:01,133 --> 03:08:04,983
Rozario, where's where's the wife?

2683
03:08:06,416 --> 03:08:08,433
Uh. I'm

2684
03:08:08,433 --> 03:08:10,983
actually kind of
getting a little bit nervous here.

2685
03:08:11,933 --> 03:08:13,500
It's not funny.

2686
03:08:14,933 --> 03:08:15,600
I can't hear.

2687
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:17,700
Why can't we open the door?

2688
03:08:24,366 --> 03:08:24,816
I don't know.

2689
03:08:24,816 --> 03:08:25,183
Tomorrow.

2690
03:08:25,183 --> 03:08:26,633
Supposed to go

2691
03:08:30,366 --> 03:08:32,283
am I missing something?

2692
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,016
The friend is.

2693
03:08:35,016 --> 03:08:36,750
Suss.
What do you mean? The friend is lost.

2694
03:08:36,750 --> 03:08:38,133
The friend is nice.

2695
03:08:38,133 --> 03:08:39,566
He's genuinely cares about us.

2696
03:08:39,566 --> 03:08:41,783
And you're calling him Suss.

2697
03:08:43,283 --> 03:08:44,966
He's a good person.

2698
03:08:45,516 --> 03:08:46,466
He's looking out for his friend.

2699
03:08:46,466 --> 03:08:48,266
He cares about us.

2700
03:08:48,383 --> 03:08:50,333
His word for us are computer's gone.

2701
03:08:50,333 --> 03:08:51,000
What's.

2702
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:54,566
How am I supposed to play you legends now?

2703
03:08:55,783 --> 03:08:57,483
Or Clarence

2704
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:04,800
if you overhear

2705
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:09,000
yours, call

2706
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:12,416
so many people, Suzie,
and you look like idiots at the end of it

2707
03:09:12,416 --> 03:09:15,300
when you realise that they're good people.

2708
03:09:16,466 --> 03:09:18,383
You call everything Suzie.

2709
03:09:18,383 --> 03:09:18,966
I swear,

2710
03:09:20,333 --> 03:09:22,616
I think you guys are Suzie.

2711
03:09:22,950 --> 03:09:25,683
You're projecting onto other characters

2712
03:09:25,683 --> 03:09:28,883
to deflect your own Suzie actions

2713
03:09:29,733 --> 03:09:31,583
because you don't want to admit it.

2714
03:09:35,016 --> 03:09:36,816
I feel like I'm missing something for real
now, though.

2715
03:09:36,816 --> 03:09:39,516
Like, where am I supposed to go?

2716
03:09:39,683 --> 03:09:41,850
Grab the ladder in the kitchen.

2717
03:09:41,850 --> 03:09:44,016
There's a ladder in the kitchen.

2718
03:09:46,683 --> 03:09:47,400
Where?

2719
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:50,366
Oh, this is a small ladder.

2720
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:55,833
What's the what's the small ladder for?

2721
03:09:56,483 --> 03:09:58,500
Ha ha ha ha.

2722
03:09:59,416 --> 03:10:02,183
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

2723
03:10:02,316 --> 03:10:06,366
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2724
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:10,983
Nervous.

2725
03:10:10,983 --> 03:10:13,433
LAUGHTER Yeah.

2726
03:10:16,916 --> 03:10:17,400
The longer

2727
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:20,966
I am in this house,
the more I want to get the fuck out again.

2728
03:10:21,633 --> 03:10:24,383
It does not feel like home sweet home

2729
03:10:24,383 --> 03:10:26,450
ow, ow, ow, ow.

2730
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:31,766
Oh, Pug. OK,

2731
03:10:32,883 --> 03:10:34,533
just just say it.

2732
03:10:34,533 --> 03:10:36,983
Come in handy. What is it?

2733
03:10:36,983 --> 03:10:39,866
What was that? Huh?

2734
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:45,633
Oh. Why

2735
03:10:48,150 --> 03:10:48,983
it's back there.

2736
03:10:48,983 --> 03:10:50,616
What's over here?

2737
03:10:53,483 --> 03:10:54,933
I have a knife.

2738
03:10:55,616 --> 03:10:56,983
Why do I have a knife for it?

2739
03:10:56,983 --> 03:10:58,400
What's back here?

2740
03:11:01,916 --> 03:11:02,766
I don't know where to go.

2741
03:11:02,766 --> 03:11:02,950
That.

2742
03:11:02,950 --> 03:11:04,550
That was behind me.

2743
03:11:07,383 --> 03:11:08,400
Origin.

2744
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:09,983
Jane, I'm Jane.

2745
03:11:09,983 --> 03:11:11,783
I am Jane.

2746
03:11:16,566 --> 03:11:19,100
What am I doing, though? Oh.

2747
03:11:29,633 --> 03:11:31,016
Oh, man.

2748
03:11:31,466 --> 03:11:32,783
Oh, man.

2749
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:35,700
Oh, oh. Oh, my God.

2750
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:38,883
The fucking reflection in the mirror
scared the shit out of me, man.

2751
03:11:39,216 --> 03:11:40,616
Oh, I thought I was a.

2752
03:11:40,616 --> 03:11:42,966
Creature looking at me.

2753
03:11:44,966 --> 03:11:49,316
Uh, there's no place.

2754
03:11:49,316 --> 03:11:51,000
Like home

2755
03:11:53,400 --> 03:11:55,900
there's no place like home.

2756
03:11:57,633 --> 03:12:00,333
You got a friend in me.

2757
03:12:01,500 --> 03:12:04,083
You got a friend in me.

2758
03:12:06,383 --> 03:12:10,083
Oh. Don't do that, bitch.

2759
03:12:10,433 --> 03:12:13,316
Please stop

2760
03:12:14,333 --> 03:12:16,016
why are you knocking brooms over?

2761
03:12:16,016 --> 03:12:17,333
Who? What are we looking for?

2762
03:12:17,333 --> 03:12:19,583
Why are we trying to stab a monster?

2763
03:12:20,516 --> 03:12:22,233
Resist spirit monster.

2764
03:12:38,016 --> 03:12:41,783
Up. On the rooftop clap, clap, clap.

2765
03:12:43,716 --> 03:12:46,533
Don't you

2766
03:12:47,033 --> 03:12:47,433
think.

2767
03:12:47,666 --> 03:12:50,066
Like there's the prayer again

2768
03:12:55,266 --> 03:12:56,883
I can open it.

2769
03:12:58,500 --> 03:12:58,833
I do.

2770
03:12:58,833 --> 03:12:59,816
I'm scared, man.

2771
03:12:59,816 --> 03:13:02,016
I don't know. All this is so dark.

2772
03:13:02,183 --> 03:13:03,666
I need a flashlight.

2773
03:13:03,666 --> 03:13:05,933
Is it making me go back

2774
03:13:11,816 --> 03:13:12,983
there's a new ghost.

2775
03:13:12,983 --> 03:13:13,683
Oh, my God.

2776
03:13:13,683 --> 03:13:15,683
I can't believe there's going to be
another new fucking ghost.

2777
03:13:24,833 --> 03:13:25,233
Oh, wait.

2778
03:13:25,233 --> 03:13:32,283
Was this here before. Or.

2779
03:13:35,100 --> 03:13:35,933
Yeah, it's a prayer.

2780
03:13:35,933 --> 03:13:38,516
It's like some kind of mantra

2781
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:39,383
oh, god.

2782
03:13:39,383 --> 03:13:41,366
I don't want to look behind me.

2783
03:13:42,033 --> 03:13:44,166
No, I'm not looking behind me.

2784
03:13:44,166 --> 03:13:44,933
Fuck you, ok?

2785
03:13:44,933 --> 03:13:45,933
Maybe I will. OK.

2786
03:13:45,933 --> 03:13:47,016
Nothing's ever

2787
03:13:47,916 --> 03:13:51,566
funny. Come

2788
03:14:02,616 --> 03:14:04,116
laugh at me.

2789
03:14:04,266 --> 03:14:05,333
Was that

2790
03:14:15,683 --> 03:14:17,133
really worried?

2791
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:19,433
Really fucking worried?

2792
03:14:19,433 --> 03:14:20,166
Guys.

2793
03:14:22,683 --> 03:14:23,683
Mm hmm.

2794
03:14:23,683 --> 03:14:26,850
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

2795
03:14:29,433 --> 03:14:32,850
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

2796
03:14:34,316 --> 03:14:36,900
Oh. Oh.

2797
03:14:36,900 --> 03:14:37,166
Fuck.

2798
03:14:37,166 --> 03:14:42,633
Is that OK?

2799
03:14:44,316 --> 03:14:46,616
She I breathe like that
because she's scared.

2800
03:14:50,183 --> 03:14:52,466
The fuck are you

2801
03:14:59,783 --> 03:15:02,583
oh, stop. Why?

2802
03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:05,133
You got to use me like that? Ma'am.

2803
03:15:05,766 --> 03:15:07,016
Don't do that.

2804
03:15:11,133 --> 03:15:16,733
Law it's

2805
03:15:16,733 --> 03:15:18,650
another radio

2806
03:15:26,983 --> 03:15:29,066
oh. Man.

2807
03:15:29,066 --> 03:15:33,533
My hands are shaking
like I actually can't control, like,

2808
03:15:33,566 --> 03:15:36,566
keeping my hand steady right now.

2809
03:15:38,816 --> 03:15:41,883
Is genuinely terrifying.

2810
03:15:42,116 --> 03:15:44,666
I didn't expect to be in this state again.

2811
03:15:44,916 --> 03:15:47,883
After what we've been through in the game,
but it pulls you straight back

2812
03:15:47,883 --> 03:15:48,666
in, straight.

2813
03:15:53,550 --> 03:15:57,083
Oh, that was hard.

2814
03:15:57,666 --> 03:15:58,183
Whoo!

2815
03:15:58,266 --> 03:15:59,216
Hello.

2816
03:15:59,633 --> 03:16:00,483
Are you a friend?

2817
03:16:00,483 --> 03:16:03,066
Are you a friend? Friendly pal.

2818
03:16:03,216 --> 03:16:06,783
Buddy buddy buddy all buddy.

2819
03:16:06,900 --> 03:16:17,800
All uh.

2820
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:22,333
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

2821
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:27,150
You're not going to come alive
or anything.

2822
03:16:27,150 --> 03:16:29,516
Right and

2823
03:16:29,516 --> 03:16:30,300
right.

2824
03:16:32,100 --> 03:16:32,883
Right?

2825
03:16:33,183 --> 03:16:34,083
Right,

2826
03:16:35,133 --> 03:16:35,916
right.

2827
03:16:36,833 --> 03:16:38,033
OK. I guess he's not

2828
03:16:44,883 --> 03:16:46,083
and I'm very annoyed.

2829
03:16:46,083 --> 03:16:48,900
I'm so fucking paranoid here.

2830
03:16:57,216 --> 03:16:58,133
As I say.

2831
03:16:58,133 --> 03:17:03,183
Oh, no, I think that's a walk inside huh?

2832
03:17:06,566 --> 03:17:09,266
Oh, the singing stopped. Why?

2833
03:17:16,733 --> 03:17:21,766
Oh, this is this fucking game.

2834
03:17:22,116 --> 03:17:23,966
Oh, God. Oh, no.

2835
03:17:23,966 --> 03:17:24,683
That's the same thing.

2836
03:17:24,683 --> 03:17:25,950
From last time

2837
03:17:34,433 --> 03:17:36,516
I think I had to go back over here.

2838
03:17:36,600 --> 03:17:37,733
Let's check

2839
03:17:39,333 --> 03:17:40,716
check and see.

2840
03:17:41,466 --> 03:17:43,733
I missed out on anything.

2841
03:17:45,416 --> 03:17:48,483
You bitch, you bitch, bitch.

2842
03:17:48,483 --> 03:17:51,783
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2843
03:17:53,183 --> 03:17:56,016
Let's not go that way.

2844
03:17:56,333 --> 03:17:57,533
Yeah. Fuck that.

2845
03:17:57,533 --> 03:17:59,250
Now I'm out of there.

2846
03:17:59,250 --> 03:18:00,600
I'm out of there.

2847
03:18:00,600 --> 03:18:02,166
Huh, huh, huh?

2848
03:18:02,466 --> 03:18:02,766
We're going to.

2849
03:18:02,766 --> 03:18:04,683
You know

2850
03:18:05,066 --> 03:18:07,050
what? What

2851
03:18:12,533 --> 03:18:15,033
Cool, cool.

2852
03:18:15,033 --> 03:18:16,350
Very cool.

2853
03:18:16,350 --> 03:18:17,166
Great moves.

2854
03:18:17,166 --> 03:18:17,700
Keep it up.

2855
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:20,633
Proud of you. I love this game.

2856
03:18:21,116 --> 03:18:21,416
Jane.

2857
03:18:21,416 --> 03:18:22,800
You got this.

2858
03:18:33,233 --> 03:18:35,916
Are you walking me out for ideal?

2859
03:18:37,500 --> 03:18:38,366
Am I in a loop?

2860
03:18:39,983 --> 03:18:42,566
Why am I in a loop?

2861
03:18:45,116 --> 03:18:48,416
I remember this looks familiar.

2862
03:18:49,650 --> 03:18:50,133
You know what this.

2863
03:18:50,133 --> 03:18:51,750
Reminds me of?

2864
03:18:53,283 --> 03:18:55,800
It reminds me of the ah, that one video

2865
03:18:56,016 --> 03:18:59,916
that was, like,
give me a tour of your of his home.

2866
03:19:00,666 --> 03:19:03,416
You guys know that really creepy youtube
video?

2867
03:19:03,416 --> 03:19:06,116
It like he's
giving you a tour of his his house. Oh.

2868
03:19:13,466 --> 03:19:19,583
My oh.

2869
03:19:19,583 --> 03:19:21,983
These are cool instruments.

2870
03:19:31,766 --> 03:19:33,366
Which stones your reflection doing?

2871
03:19:33,366 --> 03:19:35,033
They'll probably not

2872
03:19:36,716 --> 03:19:38,033
what are we looking for?

2873
03:19:38,033 --> 03:19:39,183
And why do we have this knife?

2874
03:19:39,183 --> 03:19:41,166
Like, what are we trying to stab here?

2875
03:19:41,166 --> 03:19:44,583
Obviously, she wants to stab something
of the knife, and she has the knife out

2876
03:19:46,783 --> 03:19:48,833
of both corners.

2877
03:19:49,916 --> 03:20:16,166
Nice was that coming from oh.

2878
03:20:17,666 --> 03:20:28,650
Why it's very pretty.

2879
03:20:28,716 --> 03:20:30,500
We all know

2880
03:20:34,650 --> 03:20:37,816
sounds pretty biting.

2881
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:40,616
Is it coming from here?

2882
03:20:45,033 --> 03:20:49,050
Oh, I don't know where to go.

2883
03:20:49,050 --> 03:20:50,883
There's so many tight corridors, man.

2884
03:20:50,883 --> 03:20:54,716
It's making me feel
a little claustrophobic.

2885
03:20:55,283 --> 03:20:56,583
Hey, where's Tim?

2886
03:20:56,583 --> 03:20:58,950
Brazil. Jane, why are we in the situation?

2887
03:20:58,950 --> 03:21:01,133
The radio's gone. Oh, God,
the radio is gone.

2888
03:21:01,133 --> 03:21:04,866
Oh, God, that's bad.

2889
03:21:08,133 --> 03:21:08,316
There.

2890
03:21:08,316 --> 03:21:10,316
Someone's there, someone's there,
someone's there, someone's there,

2891
03:21:10,416 --> 03:21:12,383
someone's there. Oh, God. Hey, help!

2892
03:21:12,383 --> 03:21:13,733
Help! Help! Help!

2893
03:21:13,733 --> 03:21:15,016
Get the basket.

2894
03:21:15,233 --> 03:21:17,250
Down. Help!

2895
03:21:17,250 --> 03:21:19,116
Help! Someone!

2896
03:21:19,133 --> 03:21:20,766
Right, right.

2897
03:21:23,700 --> 03:21:25,316
Kylie, fuck off.

2898
03:21:27,683 --> 03:21:29,016
I have a knife.

2899
03:21:29,333 --> 03:21:30,816
I have a fucking knife.

2900
03:21:30,816 --> 03:21:32,616
I'm afraid to use it.

2901
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:36,400
You know,

2902
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:41,466
normal level 99, rogue oh,

2903
03:21:49,116 --> 03:21:50,366
oh, no.

2904
03:21:50,783 --> 03:21:51,066
What?

2905
03:21:51,066 --> 03:21:52,500
What changed?

2906
03:21:55,566 --> 03:21:58,416
What changed here, pop?

2907
03:22:04,733 --> 03:22:07,266
Give me out and get me out.

2908
03:22:23,283 --> 03:22:24,450
I think that's a run.

2909
03:22:24,450 --> 03:22:26,133
I think I have to run

2910
03:22:26,916 --> 03:22:27,750
fucking

2911
03:22:30,450 --> 03:22:31,433
it's chasing me.

2912
03:22:31,433 --> 03:22:32,066
It's chasing me.

2913
03:22:35,816 --> 03:22:36,600
Leave

2914
03:22:37,683 --> 03:22:38,683
me alone.

2915
03:22:43,916 --> 03:22:46,083
Stay with me.

2916
03:22:51,933 --> 03:22:53,783
Why can't I move,

2917
03:22:54,266 --> 03:22:58,566
run, move oh.

2918
03:23:16,283 --> 03:23:18,500
TV continued on episode two

2919
03:23:20,850 --> 03:23:22,416
to be continued on episode two.

2920
03:23:22,416 --> 03:23:24,983
Don't I have episode two

2921
03:23:27,116 --> 03:23:29,166
can I not continue

2922
03:23:35,283 --> 03:23:36,116
oh, I can't.

2923
03:23:36,116 --> 03:23:37,133
That's it.

2924
03:23:39,683 --> 03:23:41,066
All That's it.

2925
03:23:41,883 --> 03:23:42,783
Wait,

2926
03:23:46,350 --> 03:23:49,350
it's. Huh?

2927
03:23:50,850 --> 03:23:51,816
Hold on.

2928
03:23:56,583 --> 03:23:56,883
It's.

2929
03:23:56,883 --> 03:23:58,350
Do they have chapter. Two out right.

2930
03:23:58,350 --> 03:24:01,650
Now? Is in it out

2931
03:24:02,733 --> 03:24:05,066
it's another game. Oh.

2932
03:24:06,266 --> 03:24:09,266
Oh, it's a whole nother game. OK.

2933
03:24:11,283 --> 03:24:13,016
Oh, shit.

2934
03:24:13,800 --> 03:24:14,783
Yeah, I guess it's a whole.

2935
03:24:14,783 --> 03:24:16,983
Different game then. Let me see.

2936
03:24:16,983 --> 03:24:20,933
I check it on steam real fast.

2937
03:24:23,466 --> 03:24:25,233
Well, they can't say.

2938
03:24:25,233 --> 03:24:26,316
Hold on.

2939
03:24:26,316 --> 03:24:28,683
Home sweet home.

2940
03:24:29,433 --> 03:24:31,350
Ah, Episode two.

2941
03:24:31,350 --> 03:24:34,016
Yeah, there's in episode zero
I hear. OK, I'll.

2942
03:24:34,016 --> 03:24:34,416
Come out.

2943
03:24:34,416 --> 03:24:36,150
In 2019

2944
03:24:39,066 --> 03:24:42,350
hmm. OK, I see

2945
03:24:45,233 --> 03:24:46,266
gotcha.

2946
03:24:46,266 --> 03:24:48,366
All right. All right.

2947
03:24:48,666 --> 03:24:49,166
Yeah.

2948
03:24:49,166 --> 03:24:52,166
This is all there's, it's on this theme
sorry now but.

2949
03:24:52,533 --> 03:24:53,183
Then that's enough.

2950
03:24:53,183 --> 03:24:55,350
That was kind of an abrupt ending.

2951
03:24:56,333 --> 03:25:02,633
Well we

2952
03:25:02,950 --> 03:25:05,633
start oh.

2953
03:25:06,183 --> 03:25:08,850
Bro. What the fuck?

2954
03:25:09,250 --> 03:25:11,016
We did it, though.

2955
03:25:11,016 --> 03:25:12,983
I think we finished

2956
03:25:13,983 --> 03:25:15,450
yeah, that's it for.

2957
03:25:15,450 --> 03:25:17,783
That's it for the first game.

2958
03:25:19,350 --> 03:25:21,450
This was really cool.

2959
03:25:21,450 --> 03:25:23,783
I enjoyed this a lot.

2960
03:25:26,183 --> 03:25:28,233
I honestly really enjoyed this a lot.

2961
03:25:28,233 --> 03:25:30,833
It was really fun to play.

2962
03:25:30,833 --> 03:25:31,616
Like,

2963
03:25:32,916 --> 03:25:34,800
Thank you guys
so much for the recommendation.

2964
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:38,033
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have known about this game.

2965
03:25:38,883 --> 03:25:39,066
Yeah.

2966
03:25:39,066 --> 03:25:42,233
Like I said before, the fact
that there's so much like, what's it

2967
03:25:44,916 --> 03:25:47,133
culture ingrained into the video game

2968
03:25:47,133 --> 03:25:49,416
is super cool, right?

2969
03:25:50,583 --> 03:25:53,366
And it's really interesting to learn about
while you're still getting spooked

2970
03:25:53,783 --> 03:25:57,483
from all the horror elements
of a, of a typical survival horror.

2971
03:25:57,983 --> 03:26:01,283
Like the law is good
and the stories are nice to know

2972
03:26:03,533 --> 03:26:06,983
it took me until now to figure out, oh,
like all these monsters that we've been

2973
03:26:06,983 --> 03:26:11,466
seeing is like the stuff that those are
from Jane's dreams or whatever, right?

2974
03:26:11,883 --> 03:26:12,233
Yeah.

2975
03:26:13,483 --> 03:26:19,716
Hmm. But I think this is a good place
to start for today.

2976
03:26:20,283 --> 03:26:23,916
Yes. Since we've already played through
two games we can just go back to the.

2977
03:26:24,450 --> 03:26:24,983
Yeah, let's go back.

2978
03:26:24,983 --> 03:26:28,050
To the bedroom and talk for a little bit
before we hand it off. OK,

2979
03:26:30,516 --> 03:26:31,233
mm hmm.

2980
03:26:31,833 --> 03:26:34,350
Because I think
if I want to play episode two,

2981
03:26:34,650 --> 03:26:36,900
I'll save it for another week.

2982
03:26:37,716 --> 03:26:41,516
Yeah, I'd probably save the game
for next week or something

2983
03:26:41,516 --> 03:26:44,816
like that, but there's going to be
a lot of call ups next week.

2984
03:26:44,816 --> 03:26:45,516
I don't know if we can.

2985
03:26:45,516 --> 03:26:48,083
We have time for it next week,
but I'll keep you guys updated on that.

2986
03:26:48,333 --> 03:26:48,666
All right.

2987
03:26:48,666 --> 03:26:50,700
Give me a second and then switch over.

2988
03:26:51,866 --> 03:26:54,516
Where is the bedroom

2989
03:26:57,716 --> 03:26:58,800
hold on

2990
03:26:59,483 --> 03:27:00,383
me one moments

2991
03:27:09,333 --> 03:27:15,083
OK? Oh,

2992
03:27:15,416 --> 03:27:18,150
and for some reason, the my chat is gone.

2993
03:27:19,383 --> 03:27:20,583
It disappeared on me.

2994
03:27:20,583 --> 03:27:23,433
I oh, come back

2995
03:27:25,583 --> 03:27:26,733
guys. Come back.

2996
03:27:26,733 --> 03:27:28,050
Why? Just disappear.

2997
03:27:28,050 --> 03:27:29,550
Fuck, OK.

2998
03:27:29,550 --> 03:27:31,716
Oh, well, that's fine.

2999
03:27:33,066 --> 03:27:33,750
Give me a second. I'm good.

3000
03:27:33,750 --> 03:27:37,350
Turn some music while we are chillin shot
first for a bit. OK,

3001
03:27:38,833 --> 03:27:42,100
so we're gonna be ending this off
in a bit.

3002
03:27:46,266 --> 03:27:47,466
OK? For people

3003
03:27:47,466 --> 03:27:50,550
that are still here, I do want to talk
about what's coming up next week.

3004
03:27:50,550 --> 03:27:52,833
Ah, I don't know exactly

3005
03:27:53,883 --> 03:27:56,166
what we're going to be doing for.

3006
03:27:57,783 --> 03:28:01,950
Me. For this coming week, but I know
there's going to be a lot of clubs so

3007
03:28:03,983 --> 03:28:06,266
I think we're planning to have a.

3008
03:28:06,750 --> 03:28:07,983
Nice round.

3009
03:28:07,983 --> 03:28:08,633
We're playing

3010
03:28:09,433 --> 03:28:13,566
a a club of Vox again and Ike and Remo

3011
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:16,133
on a Tuesday,

3012
03:28:16,133 --> 03:28:19,166
we're going
to be playing a game called Labyrinthine.

3013
03:28:20,133 --> 03:28:23,166
And if you guys ever heard of it,
but I heard phenomenal.

3014
03:28:23,166 --> 03:28:25,583
Luca Boogie really enjoyed the game,
I should say.

3015
03:28:25,583 --> 03:28:29,316
And so I want to give the game
a try and see what it's about.

3016
03:28:29,616 --> 03:28:31,916
Phenomenon told me
it was really fucking fun

3017
03:28:31,916 --> 03:28:35,133
and she was genuinely terrified of it
and she's ah,

3018
03:28:35,166 --> 03:28:38,183
she's also another like,
you know, kind of like a horror film.

3019
03:28:38,183 --> 03:28:41,016
So because she's like,
she's like a big family nerd.

3020
03:28:41,250 --> 03:28:42,816
And she said that this one was really fun.

3021
03:28:42,816 --> 03:28:45,833
So I think we're going to be playing that
with Vox.

3022
03:28:45,833 --> 03:28:49,116
I can review on Tuesday
and then on Wednesday

3023
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:53,033
we're going to have a violent collab.

3024
03:28:53,033 --> 03:28:55,733
With Shu.

3025
03:28:56,316 --> 03:28:58,766
Lily Picchu and Box Box.

3026
03:28:58,950 --> 03:29:02,550
I think Shu should be back by Wednesday.

3027
03:29:03,483 --> 03:29:05,966
And then I think Uki said that

3028
03:29:05,966 --> 03:29:09,950
he wanted to play something called, um,

3029
03:29:10,866 --> 03:29:14,016
Operation Tango with me next week,

3030
03:29:14,016 --> 03:29:18,483
but we haven't decided on a date yet,
so that's coming as well.

3031
03:29:18,833 --> 03:29:23,766
So yeah, I'll collab of Uki and
we have a gala with Shu, Lily and Box Box.

3032
03:29:23,766 --> 03:29:26,666
And then on Tuesday we're going to
be playing something with the

3033
03:29:28,983 --> 03:29:31,016
what's it with

3034
03:29:31,766 --> 03:29:32,966
Voxer I can reveal.

3035
03:29:32,966 --> 03:29:35,550
And also, ah,

3036
03:29:35,733 --> 03:29:38,550
it's kind of up in the air right now.

3037
03:29:38,550 --> 03:29:40,883
But

3038
03:29:41,216 --> 03:29:44,550
me and sekouno
have talked about a potential collab.

3039
03:29:44,550 --> 03:29:46,800
I don't know if it's going to be this week
or like next week,

3040
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:49,883
I mean or the upcoming week,
but we want to play something

3041
03:29:49,883 --> 03:29:51,900
with each other
and a few other people are friends.

3042
03:29:52,083 --> 03:29:53,583
It might just be Valorant and to be honest,

3043
03:29:53,583 --> 03:29:56,166
I think we're just going to do Valorant
and or something, but I'll,

3044
03:29:57,233 --> 03:29:58,733
I'll let you know

3045
03:29:59,416 --> 03:30:04,766
as soon if we figure things out
because this wants to make people aware.

3046
03:30:05,033 --> 03:30:05,583
That.

3047
03:30:06,066 --> 03:30:06,900
Oh, come

3048
03:30:10,266 --> 03:30:13,116
I play coma. what's coma.

3049
03:30:14,183 --> 03:30:16,466
Coma friend.

3050
03:30:16,466 --> 03:30:17,466
I've never heard of that.

3051
03:30:17,466 --> 03:30:19,116
I never heard that game before.

3052
03:30:19,116 --> 03:30:20,700
What the heck is coma ?

3053
03:30:23,033 --> 03:30:24,966
what.

3054
03:30:24,966 --> 03:30:28,883
Yeah, I think if I play with fire
psych or not, I think I'm going to think

3055
03:30:28,883 --> 03:30:32,666
we're going to do something off
Luka to Luka and Pichu.

3056
03:30:32,666 --> 03:30:34,050
And also.

3057
03:30:34,200 --> 03:30:35,366
I think it's probably.

3058
03:30:35,366 --> 03:30:37,500
Just going to be more violence,
to be honest,

3059
03:30:37,500 --> 03:30:41,633
unless we figure out like a different
like horror collab game.

3060
03:30:41,816 --> 03:30:44,916
But yeah, so there's a lot there is.

3061
03:30:44,916 --> 03:30:48,750
A lot coming up and I am really excited

3062
03:30:48,750 --> 03:30:51,150
for it
to get to play more games of friends.

3063
03:30:51,900 --> 03:30:54,000
And friends and.

3064
03:30:54,533 --> 03:30:56,883
You know, more excuses,
fine workings of friends.

3065
03:30:57,333 --> 03:31:00,083
It always makes me happy. So yeah.

3066
03:31:00,083 --> 03:31:02,533
You got troubles there's no gear.

3067
03:31:02,550 --> 03:31:03,716
That like there's no guarantee.

3068
03:31:03,716 --> 03:31:06,533
Like, what's it that

3069
03:31:06,983 --> 03:31:10,650
the collab with uki
is going to be this coming week though

3070
03:31:10,950 --> 03:31:12,966
that's not soccer
since he's still on vacation.

3071
03:31:13,266 --> 03:31:17,616
He'll probably be back around once day,
so probably be on the weekend.

3072
03:31:17,850 --> 03:31:18,300
I think

3073
03:31:20,733 --> 03:31:23,400
OK. Oh.

3074
03:31:23,400 --> 03:31:24,533
But that's just.

3075
03:31:24,533 --> 03:31:27,150
To give everybody idea
about what's coming up.

3076
03:31:27,366 --> 03:31:30,900
So if you guys are excited
as much as I am, I'm going to read through

a hard time
watching me play with that lady

3098
03:32:14,400 --> 03:32:15,000

03:33:09,033 --> 03:33:11,666
it's growing every day
and it makes me happy,

3121
03:33:12,083 --> 03:33:15,200
like whenever I'm on
somebody else's like channel on twitch

3122
03:33:15,216 --> 03:33:18,300

it doesn't make me like, you know, a bit.

3123
03:33:18,983 --> 03:33:22,566

All. Milk. Thank you for all the bits.

And Michael,
thank you for all the bits too.

There's a lot of bits. Holy shit.

3130
03:33:34,466 --> 03:33:39,683
So many bits and anything you
for all the bits as well are shoddy.

3131
03:33:39,683 --> 03:33:42,200
Thank you for the on, on your bits

03:33:42,216 --> 03:33:42,750
Thank you for that.

3133
03:33:42,750 --> 03:33:45,683
I know absolutely adore your shoes,
especially when you play horror games.

3134
03:33:45,966 --> 03:33:49,616
A lot of pressure recently crying face
if possible.

3135
03:33:49,616 --> 03:33:54,366
Can you say a few words of encouragement
for me and friends in the same situation.

3136
03:33:54,366 --> 03:33:55,733
As me could ever.

3137
03:33:57,416 --> 03:33:58,583
Hey, if

3138
03:33:58,583 --> 03:34:01,800
you're under a lot of pressure,
just remember to take breaks, ok?

3139
03:34:01,800 --> 03:34:06,300
It's totally fine to just sit back
and take it like it's.

3140
03:34:06,300 --> 03:34:07,416
Equally. As good.

3141
03:34:07,416 --> 03:34:09,683
It's like do your work,
but it's also good.

3142
03:34:09,683 --> 03:34:12,416
So like, you know, balance it out
and treat yourself right.

3143
03:34:12,416 --> 03:34:14,466
So hey, don't overdo it.

3144
03:34:14,466 --> 03:34:19,100
Otherwise yeah, you're going to over
burn yourself out and

3145
03:34:20,166 --> 03:34:21,483
that's not good.

3146
03:34:21,483 --> 03:34:23,483
But hey, I don't know what you're doing.

3147
03:34:23,483 --> 03:34:26,100
I don't know what some of you guys
are doing. But good luck, OK?

3148
03:34:26,316 --> 03:34:27,566
You got this

3149
03:34:29,316 --> 03:34:33,000
 I believe in you,dude .

3150
03:34:34,616 --> 03:34:35,550
I see. What was I saying?

3151
03:34:35,550 --> 03:34:38,583
If you're taking recommendations, I think
horsing around might be to your liking.

3152
03:34:38,583 --> 03:34:41,850
What is haunting ground
haunting ground game.

3153
03:34:44,466 --> 03:34:45,833
All this is a PlayStation.

3154
03:34:45,833 --> 03:34:48,533
Two game.
I don't think I can play this coming up.

3155
03:34:48,533 --> 03:34:51,783
Why so excited for the following
streams and collab.

3156
03:34:51,783 --> 03:34:53,250
Yeah, that's that's a really

3157
03:34:55,916 --> 03:34:57,066
that's a PlayStation two.

3158
03:34:57,066 --> 03:35:01,650
Yeah, I don't think I can play that is
I don't really have a PlayStation two

3159
03:35:01,766 --> 03:35:03,816
unless I can play it on my PlayStation
four.

3160
03:35:03,816 --> 03:35:05,000
I'm not sure

3161
03:35:06,516 --> 03:35:09,483
are all a second year for the time
until the end.

3162
03:35:09,483 --> 03:35:11,633
It makes me feel sad.
All your talk about little nightmares.

3163
03:35:11,633 --> 03:35:12,716
Thank you.

3164
03:35:13,083 --> 03:35:15,083
Yeah, it was a really sombre ending.

3165
03:35:15,083 --> 03:35:18,233
I talking it thinking about it,
how things are.

3166
03:35:18,516 --> 03:35:20,166
I guess six.

3167
03:35:20,166 --> 03:35:24,266
Did like maybe
she realised like who he actually was

3168
03:35:24,633 --> 03:35:27,266
and like,
you know, dropped him to like prevent

3169
03:35:28,283 --> 03:35:30,800
to just keep the loop
going to save herself or

3170
03:35:31,083 --> 03:35:33,150
I don't know, it's hard to think.

3171
03:35:33,150 --> 03:35:35,616
I don't know why, why that happened.

3172
03:35:35,883 --> 03:35:39,783
And why she did that friend.

3173
03:35:39,783 --> 03:35:40,516
Because I'm Yeah.

3174
03:35:40,516 --> 03:35:44,816
Like is I'm not, I don't understand
it completely as to the reasoning

3175
03:35:45,383 --> 03:35:48,633
why she needed to let go of mono
and let him die

3176
03:35:48,783 --> 03:35:53,100
but ah now and I've watched him
just like you know turn into the hat man.

3177
03:35:53,850 --> 03:35:56,450
We stick together uh.

3178
03:35:56,933 --> 03:35:59,166

Yay. You all right?

3181
03:36:03,383 --> 03:36:04,883
I think that's it.

3182
03:36:06,116 --> 03:36:06,866
They have read everything.

3183
03:36:06,866 --> 03:36:09,783
They could be a little bit small.

3184
03:36:10,116 --> 03:36:10,683
Okey dokey.

3185
03:36:10,683 --> 03:36:14,033
Bros Siren and Fatal
Frame are also really good.

3186
03:36:14,216 --> 03:36:16,166
I've heard a lot of good. Things
about Fatal Frame.

3187
03:36:16,166 --> 03:36:18,183
我爱你，我爱你

3188
03:36:18,183 --> 03:36:18,816
Yeah.

3189
03:36:21,033 --> 03:36:21,600
I feel for Ms.

3190
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:23,666
The for the cameras. Right.

3191
03:36:23,666 --> 03:36:25,733
But I've heard.

3192
03:36:25,733 --> 03:36:27,266
I've heard good things about Fatal Frame.

3193
03:36:27,266 --> 03:36:29,383
Oh, know, you guys like Fatal Frame? Up.

3194
03:36:29,766 --> 03:36:31,466
Someone said White
day was another good one.

3195
03:36:31,466 --> 03:36:33,533
Why? It's a horror game.

3196
03:36:33,533 --> 03:36:37,166
You can see side destiny.

3197
03:36:37,583 --> 03:36:39,866
And notorious cult classic Korean horror.

3198
03:36:40,083 --> 03:36:41,883
Sneak in to school at midnight here.

3199
03:36:41,883 --> 03:36:43,283
It's from your sweetheart's diary

3200
03:36:43,283 --> 03:36:46,600
and get caught in a terrifying game of cat
and mouse. Hmm.

3201
03:36:47,766 --> 03:36:51,183
hold on .

3202
03:36:52,166 --> 03:36:54,716
It looks like it's.

3203
03:36:54,716 --> 03:36:56,166
In me.

3204
03:36:56,166 --> 03:36:57,900
Well received I'm not sure

3205
03:37:01,616 --> 03:37:02,466
I'll look at it, though.

3206
03:37:02,466 --> 03:37:04,383
We'll get a little bit more.

3207
03:37:05,283 --> 03:37:08,000
OK, we're going to end the stream off

3208
03:37:08,016 --> 03:37:11,066
here, though, and I'm going to go
look for somebody to read tonight. OK,

3209
03:37:12,116 --> 03:37:13,616
thank you for coming by, guys.

3210
03:37:13,616 --> 03:37:16,200
And I'll see you tomorrow
because I remember you playing some.

3211
03:37:16,350 --> 03:37:17,416
Alien isolation.

3212
03:37:17,416 --> 03:37:20,633
Tomorrow. I'll be excited for that

3213
03:37:20,633 --> 03:37:21,216
as I am.

3214
03:37:21,216 --> 03:37:24,416
I love Alien. I love aliens so much.

3215
03:37:24,416 --> 03:37:26,733
Now we'll get to go live again
tomorrow at 9 a.m.

3216
03:37:27,033 --> 03:37:29,166
and then we're going to have our YouTube
stream on Sunday.

3217
03:37:29,166 --> 03:37:32,483
So, yeah, for people that don't know,
there's going to be a impromptu

3218
03:37:32,483 --> 03:37:35,733
YouTube stream on a Sunday,
we're going to be doing a Q&A.

3219
03:37:35,883 --> 03:37:39,866
So use the hashtag, #AskShoto
or if you have any questions.

3220
03:37:39,866 --> 03:37:42,150
OK, I'm
going to be scrolling through all of it.

3221
03:37:42,366 --> 03:37:44,016
So finally, we do it right here.

3222
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,750
Ask Shoto.

3223
03:37:47,816 --> 03:37:49,683
 on Twitter.

3224
03:37:49,683 --> 03:37:50,933
Use this, use this.

3225
03:37:50,933 --> 03:37:51,600
All right.

3226
03:37:53,433 --> 03:37:56,616
And then I'll go through it
and answer anything you guys want

3227
03:37:57,416 --> 03:38:00,833
or I'll try to answer most questions
for the US on this stream, OK?

3228
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:05,316
As we've never really had an official

3229
03:38:05,316 --> 03:38:08,250
Q&A dedicated stream,
I think that'll be kind of fun, right?

3230
03:38:08,950 --> 03:38:12,716
While I get used to how YouTube works,

3231
03:38:13,083 --> 03:38:14,333
all right, guys,

3232
03:38:15,083 --> 03:38:17,783
go play an ad break
and then I'll look for somebody to read.

3233
03:38:17,783 --> 03:38:19,616
So give me a second.

3234
