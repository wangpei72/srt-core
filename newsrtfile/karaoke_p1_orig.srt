00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,783
(lyrics)

3
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,983
Hi guys.

4
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,066
Hold up.

5
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:51,166
Let me turn the music down a little bit.

6
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,166
Everybody. What's up.

7
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,383
Good evening. Good morning.

8
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,383
Hope a lot of people.

9
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,316
didn't have to wake up too early
for this as well, but.

10
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,133
Hey. Hi, everybody.

11
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,950
Hope you're having a good day so far.

12
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:09,783
It's been a little bit,
but I've been working hard.

13
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,116
I've been working
really, really hard for the stream.

14
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:17,350
Because, you know,
I've wanted to really make sure

15
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,266
I knew how to do some of these songs.

16
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,000
So that's why, you know, I spent.

17
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,116
Pretty much all.

18
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:28,383
Day today and all day yesterday doing
what's it called?

19
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,866
Just practising a bunch of songs

20
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,850
Umm,for the stream.

21
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,600
I am going to have sound

22
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,500
alerts and notifications off in order to,

23
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,216
you know, just make sure there's
no interruptions during the stream.

24
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:50,133
But I will probably be doing
a reading for all of the

25
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,366
for all the donations and

26
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:56,650
any other messages
you guys send after we do our karaoke, OK?

27
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,733
So we'll have a bit of an.

28
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,233
After party and then just chill and chat
once the karaoke is over.

29
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:02,716
If that sounds good to you guys.

30
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,316
All right.

31
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:07,683
Yeah, we are.

32
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:09,100
And I'm so nervous.

33
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,733
I don't know why. I've done karaokes before,
but I think it's.

34
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,050
Just because, like,

35
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,116
I don't know, there's just so much more
so many more of you guys around now.

36
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:18,816
That makes it.

37
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:22,783
All the more like my heart
is going really fast.

38
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,133
Right now.

39
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,283
Like, if I had the microphone the yes on
my microphone, I could let you guys hear.

40
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,983
Actually, I do, but. I don't think
I want to do that. Right now.

41
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,833
It's gone.

42
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,700
Ba dum ba dum ba dum, ba dum, ba dum.

43
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,416
And and my hands are,
you know, I'm doing the thing

44
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,600
where when I get nervous,
I, like, rub my legs.

45
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,583
Oh, my God.

46
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,616
I don't know why.

47
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:46,483
It's like the nerves are getting to me
right now, but I think, like, once

48
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:50,200
you get into the songs, it'll be OK.

49
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,883
Yeah, we've done

50
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,483
karaoke before, but it's just,
you know, I'm.

51
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,066
I'm. I'm shy of it from time to time,
I guess.

52
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,733
I don't know.

53
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm just the.

54
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,916
Ignore me in my, you know, nerves
getting all over the place.

55
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,216
But, yeah. I

56
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,766
I think I have.

57
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:16,533
Quite a few songs that I just want to sing
that are kind of new.

58
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:20,050
And there's some there's going to be
some old ones returning,

59
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:25,516
but I'm OK with taking song requests
in, in between songs, but,

60
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,333
you know, just don't request it
during the songs.

61
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,883
When I'm done with a song.

62
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,483
In between, we can talk.

63
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:35,350
And then if you have a request,
that's something I know I can't promise

64
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,733
I can do like a song that, ah,
what's that?

65
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:41,100
I can't promise that I can do a song

66
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,616
that you
want me to do because I may not know it.

67
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,200
Right? I can, I can

68
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,683
attempt to,
if I know the song though, but like.

69
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,283
Yeah.

70
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,250
But, oh dude, I,

71
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,633
I'm so excited because this is a big.

72
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:01,083
Celebration for a really big milestone
that we hit on the channel.

73
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:05,266
300 K on Twitch is no joke, guys.

74
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,416
That's a lot of people and it's a

75
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,350
make even like, you know, more crazy.

76
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,583
It's over that over
before I drink on Twitter

77
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,416
and on YouTube,
we're almost at 400 as well like that.

78
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:21,316
There's a lot happening.

79
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:24,883
There's a lot, a lot happening
and I got a lot of plans

80
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:28,383
and there's like new there's
so much coming down the line and I hope

81
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:32,433
everyone's excited for it
cause I am super stoked for everything

82
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,400
that's going to be happening

83
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,450
Congratulations on all the followers.

84
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,583
Thank you. Thank you so much.

85
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,533
Congrats. Congrats.

86
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,516
Thank you, guys.

87
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:44,800
I don't know.

88
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,983
Why I was so nervous today, ah but

89
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,883
just got to shake off the nervous.
Shoto, shake off the nervous.

90
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,450
It's. It'll be okay.

91
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,883
Is my throat OK?

92
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:56,416
Yeah, my throat is OK. Yesterday, I.

93
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,150
Kind of overdid it
because I realised, like,

94
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,200
it got really raspy,
but I slept with my humidifier on and

95
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,816
gave it some proper rest in the morning
before I practise again.

96
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:08,083
So I think I'm pretty. Yeah, pretty good.

97
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,483
I feel I am pretty good.

98
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,900
I don't think there's going
to be any problems, but I know my limits,

99
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,566
so don't worry.

100
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,783
I will be able to.

101
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:17,566
I'll stop when I feel like it's too much.

102
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:23,533
But usually I can handle what my throat is
a, you know, a sturdy boy.

103
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,316
He's got it.

104
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:27,583
But hopefully.

105
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,316
Everyone's been having a wonderful week
so far.

106
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,666
It's already Friday.

107
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,316
It's Saturday for some of you.

108
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:37,450
Saturday morning, I think an hour
or about to head into another week.

109
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,283
It's it's almost may believe that
April is already almost over and then.

110
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:46,483
We're heading into another month of spring
and then summer's coming down the line.

111
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,666
And man, it's crazy, guys.

112
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,966
Like we're
almost to the halfway point for the year

113
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,866
it's it's a really fucking crazy dude,

114
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,966
but I'm excited for everything
that's coming.

115
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,166
And like I said before, hopefully

116
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,766
your week's been good
and everyone's doing well

117
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:07,866
for your exams
because I know it's a busy exam period.

118
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:12,316
So. So, like I said, Livestream,
you got this.

119
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,433
All right?
Don't don't stress out too much over it.

120
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,550
Just take it easy and, like, don't,
you know, cram everything.

121
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,050
You'll be fine.

122
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,966
Lots of people are still doing exams,
but if you.

123
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:25,533
Finish your exams,
hey, pog, you're done, GG, guys.

124
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,333
You made it

125
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,333
to the yards at the end of the year
and gets enjoy your summer vacation break.

126
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,383
Right. I'll I think a lot of.

127
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,266
People get to enjoy their breaks now
since they're done with school.

128
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,400
OK, but I think.

129
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,033
We can probably head into the first song
just to, like,

130
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:46,000
you know, get things, you know, break,
break the ice for tonight.

131
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,600
Guessing are an old favourite of mine
I've done on the channel

132
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:53,650
quite a few times,
but I'm not like all the time,

133
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,650
but I like the song a lot

134
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:02,116
and if you guys want to guess,
you guys want to guess what song it is.

135
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:05,050
It's something we've seen before, so

136
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,366
probably not too much of a surprise mm.

137
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,400
Lemon.

138
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,333
No, not lemon.

139
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,166
Oh, give me a second.

140
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,000
Wait a second. What's happening?

141
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,166
Oh, no. Oh,

142
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,016
oh, God.

143
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:24,966
Internet

144
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:27,733
oh, no way.

145
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:28,333
Internet.

146
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,833
What are you doing?

147
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,033
Oh, no. Oh.

148
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,083
Oh, god. OK.

149
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,783
All Oh, shit.

150
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,833
Oh, fuck, dude.

151
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,866
Really?

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,433
Ah, I think. I'm.

153
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:03,050
Ah. It seems that there is some lag. Hmm.

154
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,616
Hold on.

155
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,633
I think it might get better.

156
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:10,316
Hopefully that was temporary

157
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:11,683
yeah.

158
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,783
Hopefully it's back now. Oh, my God.

159
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,816
I don't know what that was.

160
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,683
Mm. Is it butter?

161
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:22,116
I think it's better now. Oh, jeez.

162
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,350
Oh, jeez.

163
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,083
It's like. Uh.

164
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,133
Can you guys hear me?

165
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,566
Is everything back
where we were chillin or die?

166
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,416
Jobs.

167
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:31,933
Are things ok?

168
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,783
OK, yeah.

169
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:34,783
Just be sure to.

170
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,033
Refresh the stream. Hold on. Let me check

171
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,833
to make sure that everything's good.

172
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,866
I hope. I hope.

173
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:43,333
And and

174
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,733
that's not being dumb again tonight,
because if it is then I would be very sad.

175
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,366
I could. Yeah.

176
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,283
Just refresh on if everything's OK.

177
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,016
If it's a bit laggy.

178
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:54,933
I think it's good now.

179
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,533
I think it was just a temporary hiccup.

180
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:58,866
We cool now?

181
00:14:58,866 --> 00:14:59,866
OK, yeah.

182
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,966
We'll wait a little bit
until everyone, like,

183
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,366
you know, everyone stabilises again
because.

184
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:05,466
I think that was just a.

185
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,950
Little you know, we're a little

186
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:10,683
kind of.

187
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,116
Just just a small. Blip.

188
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,616
Don't know why that happened, though.

189
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,966
I think we're good now. Yeah.

190
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:17,866
Yeah, sorry about that.

191
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,466
I don't know why that happened.

192
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,583
Hmm. That's odd.

193
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,250
Well, hopefully that doesn't happen

194
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,816
for the rest of the night,
because if it and look.

195
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,783
Well, I'm gonna.

196
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm going to eat Comcast's.

197
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,466
Arse. OK?

198
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,216
But a lot of you are saying quite it's.

199
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,583
Did I really think that that much?

200
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,966
I do. To be honest. You're right.

201
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,733
But no. We're not singing that one today.

202
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,800
Um, yeah.

203
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,333
Hold on. Give me a second. I'm gonna

204
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:55,083
find the lyrics for it right now.

205
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,283
Because I didn't pull up the lyrics
like a smart move.

206
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:02,983
Why don't I do that beforehand?

207
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:06,933
Hold on. OK.

208
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,200
All right.

209
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,166
There it is.

210
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,883
All right, here we go.

211
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,583
For some of the night

212
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,533
now was my. Heart, dude.

213
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,750
My heart needs to get it
under control. Ah,

214
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,833
all right.

215
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:41,500
私は私

216
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:44,166
貴方は貴方と

217
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:53,483
昨夜言ってた そんな気もする

218
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:58,966
わ~~

219
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:03,133
グレイのジャケットに

220
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,500
見覚えがある

221
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,566
コーヒーのしみ

222
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,583
相変らずなのね

223
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,733
ショーウィンドウに

224
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,250
二人映れば

225
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,933
stay with me

226
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:27,183
真夜中のドアをたたき

227
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:31,833
帰らないでと泣いた

228
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:39,100
あの季節が 今 目の前

229
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:45,133
Stay with me 口ぐせを言いながら

230
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:49,150
二人の瞬間を

231
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:52,933
抱いて

232
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:57,633
まだ忘れず 大事に

233
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,250
していた

234
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,716
恋と愛とは

235
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:11,083
違うものだよと

236
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,083
昨夜言われた

237
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,250
そんな気もするわ

238
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,333
二度目の冬が来て

239
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,400
離れていった貴方の心

240
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:33,733
ふり返ればいつも

241
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:39,133
そこに 貴方を

242
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,733
感じていたの

243
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:48,700
Stay with me

244
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:50,500
真夜中のドアを

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,700
たたき 心に穴が

246
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,800
あいた

247
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,533
あの季節が

248
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:07,350
今 目の前 stay with me

249
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,983
口ぐせを言いながら

250
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:18,000
二人の瞬間を抱いて

251
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,966
まだ忘れず

252
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:25,533
暖めてた

253
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:29,300
まだ忘れず 大事にしていた

254
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:38,833
oh! Uh.

255
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,583
shake off nervous, Shoto.

256
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,933
Come on, it's not that bad.

257
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,133
Oh, my God I feel I feel like I of.

258
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,266
Bruh ruh ruh ruh.

259
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,066
I got.

260
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,416
I got real nervous during that one, bros.

261
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,683
Damn, I think I fumbled a lyric or two,
but that's OK.

262
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,266
That's OK.

263
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,866
So yeah,
that was the first song of the night.

264
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,583
Stay with. Me. It's uhm.

265
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,316
I only.

266
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,716
Got in so like,
you know, city pop not too long ago,

267
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:12,783
but it quickly became one of my favourites
because of the city pop.

268
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:16,750
or Japanese pop genre and God it is,

269
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,183
it's such a beautiful song.

270
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:22,266
I always go back to it
whenever I want it, you know, just

271
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,600
like the original song.

272
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,383
I like the guitar version
or anything like the O.G version.

273
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:33,000
It's so fucking good and I recommend
people listen to the full thing

274
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,383
if they haven't before.

275
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,983
I'm glad you guys liked it.

276
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,783
Thank you so much.

277
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,166
Like I said before, I.

278
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,866
Will read through the donas.

279
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:47,116
All of the gift, subs, and bits after

280
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,783
the karaoke session is over. OK.

281
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,050
I promise I will

282
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,683
I love you guys.

283
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,616
I'm glad everyone was able to,

284
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:03,033
you know, come by today
and make time for this because.

285
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,283
I really.

286
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:06,850
Wanted to do something special.

287
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,383
As a, you know, as a celebration stream
for a

288
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,366
for this milestone.

289
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:18,250
And I thought, you know,
I think another like

290
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:21,983
alcohol, whatever, one shot, one screams,
everything would just be like, yeah.

291
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,633
But I think the best way I can do it

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,116
is by sharing something
that is really precious to me

293
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:33,766
and something that I feel like
is probably my most prised.

294
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,550
Oh, I don't know.

295
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,750
In most

296
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,333
the thing
I'm like most shy about my singing.

297
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,433
Like, I fully believe that anybody

298
00:21:44,716 --> 00:21:48,100
who shares their singing voice
with the world or like any other person

299
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,816
or just like another of friends or an
individual, it's something very special.

300
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,716
Singing and hearing somebody like

301
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,383
their own
singing is something magical to me.

302
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,983
And that's. Why. I.

303
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,183
I feel like

304
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:09,183
hearing being like, graced
with somebody else's voice when they sing

305
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:13,366
a song is like one of the highest honours,
I guess, to me.

306
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,483
So that's why when people had their
first time karaoke is

307
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:20,316
like, you know, my other friends did.

308
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:21,333
It was just.

309
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,583
It made me smile.
It made me smile so much.

310
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:28,233
And I really hope I get to hear
more people who haven't sing, sung

311
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:34,533
Yeah.

312
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,183
We're
going to be drinking some alcohol later,

313
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:38,916
but I don't have
I have some in the fridge nearby

314
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,883
so. Yeah, that was.

315
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,866
Stay with me

316
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,316
I hope you guys enjoyed that

317
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:52,333
So this next Song

318
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:54,666
I wanted.

319
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,066
To talk a bit before we sing the song.

320
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,950
It's been.

321
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,016
It's been wonderful.

322
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,483
And I have.

323
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,216
Loved every moment we've

324
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:12,283
gone to share together on our adventure.

325
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,983
And the reason why I started this guild

326
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:21,033
and the reason why I'm here with you all

327
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:25,483
now is because of a promise
to a friend and

328
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:27,433
a friend.

329
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:31,033
It's a friend who was lost long ago.

330
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,616
Many, along with many others from my home,

331
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:39,600
we promised each other to see the world
to go on many adventures to soar,

332
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:43,783
the blue skies of elves on ships
into coastal waters of the east.

333
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,600
But and we wanted to do it all together.

334
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,700
Hand in hand. And that was our dream. But

335
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:51,766
he's not with me anymore.

336
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:54,383
And since that day, our

337
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,483
since I'd say I was

338
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,866
lost, confused, and.

339
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:05,850
And I didn't know what to have my.

340
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,283
Myself.

341
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:10,683
I had no one,
and I lost everything I cared for.

342
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,616
But being in this guild with all of you

343
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:16,800
and continuing to

344
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:20,583
grow and rebuild

345
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,716
this family, I once lost

346
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:28,216
has been the most surreal journey.

347
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:32,533
And I promised Aether
that I would see the world with him.

348
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,633
But now I carry on that promise

349
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:38,716
to you guys and to myself.

350
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:43,083
And I vow to journey forever and ever.

351
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,916
As long as my soul continues to burn.

352
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,250
As long as my legs can stand.

353
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,433
And as long as you all
will stay by my side.

354
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:56,133
I mean, I just want to adventure
and carry on his wish

355
00:24:56,283 --> 00:25:00,033
for not only the both of us,
but for me and my guilds.

356
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:00,433
Like,

357
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:04,866
I'm your guild leader and it's been

358
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:09,433
it's been the greatest honour

359
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:11,800
in the world to be someone that

360
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:17,150
to be someone that you can look up to,

361
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,633
to be someone to inspire

362
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:22,533
and to laugh with and

363
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,533
I promise

364
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,866
I promise to take you

365
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:30,250
my guildies,

366
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:33,216
that as long as you're with me

367
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:38,266
and as long as you're with the Guild,

368
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,666
no, I will continue to do my best

369
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:46,966
and make this an unforgettable journey.

370
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:51,183
An unforgettable journey to remember

371
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,500
for the rest of your lives.

372
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,066
And I. I

373
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,766
I want to hold.

374
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:03,400
On to this feeling you've given me.

375
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:06,966
And I never wants these journeys to end.

376
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,666
And I'm prepared

377
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,116
to take on the strongest of bosses,

378
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:16,450
the most difficult of rides.

379
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,566
And I sound like it and the most

380
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,666
intimidating of our worlds.

381
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:26,316
Unknowns in order to keep doing
what I'm doing with you all

382
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:30,133
now for as long as I can and I just.

383
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,266
I really want to try.

384
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:35,383
I really just wanna try

385
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,466
So thank you all

386
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:42,283
for making me
the happiest boy in the world.

387
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,666
Really?

388
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,150
I can't.

389
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,916
I can't thank you enough for that.

390
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,466
And for helping me fulfil my promise

391
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,800
The next song
I wanted to sing captures that

392
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:02,766
this feeling that I've been holding on
since the very beginning

393
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:05,383
and since we've gone on this journey
together.

394
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,116
And it's called The Promise of the World.

395
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,500
It's from Howl's Moving Castle.

396
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,683
I think a few of you might know it

397
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,266
I've never sung this before.

398
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,966
I've tried to practise, and I hope it goes
well.

399
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,350
I'm OK.

400
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,666
I gotta look up the lyrics.

401
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,683
There it is.

402
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,383
You're so dumb shoto.

403
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,483
涙の奥に

404
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:12,533
~

405
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:18,633
ゆらぐほほえみは

世界の

409
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:33,283
約束

~

411
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,766
いまは一人

412
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:50,083
でも二人の昨日

413
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:57,266
から 今日

414
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,833
は生まれきらめく

415
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:06,950
初めて会った日のように

416
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:10,566
~

417
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:13,083
思い出のう

418
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,050
ちに

419
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:20,900
あなたはいない

420
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:26,083
~

421
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:31,666
そよかぜとなって

422
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:36,883
頬に触れてくる

423
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,883
~

424
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:51,633

426
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:20,733
木漏れ日の午後の

427
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:28,433
別れのあとも

428
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,966
決して

429
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:38,250
終わらない

430
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,650
世界

431
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,883
の約束.

432
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,433
いまは一人

433
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:54,250
でも

434
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,183
明日は限りない

435
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,616
あなたが

436
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,716
教えてくれた

437
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,116
夜にひそむ

438
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:18,150
やさしさ

439
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:24,600
思い出のうちに

440
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:28,450
あなたはい

441
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,200
ない

442
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,550
せせらぎの

443
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:42,516
歌に

444
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:45,283
この空の色に

445
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:49,050
花の香りに

446
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,433
いつまでも生きて

447
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,100
~huh

448
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,433
oh, god.

449
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,583
Oh, oh, oh.

450
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,933
I yeah.

451
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,116
That's a apologise there.

452
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,766
I think I. Almost ah, I think I was, I was.

453
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:40,533
Holding back a little bit
because I told myself I wouldn't.

454
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:45,883
Cry.

455
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:50,050
oh, I'm sorry.

456
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,133
God.

457
00:32:54,550 --> 00:33:00,466
I really don't appreciate you guys a lot,
so thank you for being here

458
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,933
and for

459
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,150
for holding

460
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,550
that promise I made long ago to my friend.

461
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,783
It means a lot.

462
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:17,466
So yeah, that was

463
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,350
that was a promise of the world.

464
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,850
It's a song

465
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,933
composed by, you know,  Hisaishi Jō.

466
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:31,900
It's from, from

467
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,166
it's a Ghibli song from Howl's
Moving Castle, and it's

468
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,666
something
I think fondly about long ago. And

469
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:41,200
it has a

470
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,833
sense of nostalgia to me
til when I when I listen to it

471
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,150
and I finally got to learn it
and share it with you guys.

472
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,683
And I'm happy that I did
I hope you enjoyed it.

473
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,200
I didn't butcher anything.

474
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,350
I think I did. But

475
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,966
muah,

476
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,283
thank you guys.

477
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:09,616
Ah.

478
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,400
So let me add that to the list that was

479
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:22,966
promise of the world. OK?

480
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,733
OK. It was

481
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,633
I was just a little
a little shaky there, but

482
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,683
then I just.

483
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:36,400
The song is a lot.

484
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,566
More like beautiful.

485
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:41,566
I thought when I actually got to sing it

486
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,566
and like, you know, go through the lyrics
and learn my flow with it.

487
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,616
I've.

488
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:49,000
I've known the song for a long time
because I was moving.

489
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,066
Castle used to be part of my,
you know, childhood.

490
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:52,150
I love that movie.

491
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,550
And I love the
you know, I love Ghibli films a lot.

492
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:59,083
So I guess it's there's a difference
between just listening to it

493
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,283
and learning the songs
and learning the lyrics and like learning

494
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:06,966
the flow of it with the in like,
you know, tandem with the instrumental.

495
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:08,866
It's really beautiful.

496
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:12,166
And and I think I really don't want to.

497
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,466
It feel, It makes me feel

498
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:20,116
like I want to learn more songs, I guess
for lack of a good explanation there.

499
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,550
I think this one
of all the ones that I practise

500
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:25,566
was the

501
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:29,100
was that really pushed me
to get more motivation

502
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:32,433
to sing some more new songs
and share with you guys

503
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:38,283
oh, OK.

504
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:44,350
Yeah, that was Promise of the World.

505
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:49,066
I love you so much.

506
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,166
I love you guys too.

507
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,366
Thank you.

508
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:54,683
Thank you.

509
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:58,266
It's like it's very warm.

510
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,766
And comforting to have them.

511
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,966
You know, the company of my guildies here.

512
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:04,016
It's like, you know, cheer me on when.

513
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:05,800
I like I was.

514
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,200
Really nervous even yesterday.

515
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,816
Two days ago, I think that's.

516
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:12,466
When the nerves started hitting.
And I don't know why.

517
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,016
I guess, like,

518
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:19,266
like I said before, it's just the thought
of there being so many new guild members.

519
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:22,266
And, you know, the fact that I'm just

520
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:25,266
there's a lot of new songs still,
and it's like, out of my comfort zone.

521
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:29,700
Which is really making me

522
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:33,216
but it means a lot that you all are here.

523
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,483
Like, I don't know what I would do
if I don't have my guildies

524
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,950
there to support me. And

525
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,966
you guys're always still, as always still.

526
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:48,583
And I give back. OK?

527
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:51,916
But for my next song,

528
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,116
I think I'm going to do another good

529
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:57,666
do another one
that's familiar to a lot of you guys.

530
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,366
It's uh. it's another city pop song.

531
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,283
You guys want to take a guess?

532
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,016
you wanna take a guess or what it is?

533
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,066
It's I guess.

534
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,883
I've done it before multiple times as well

535
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:14,083
as solitary.

536
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,400
Just that.

537
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,333
Dude, I. Wish I could do right on time.

538
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,866
Oh, my God. Right on time
is such an amazing song.

539
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,283
Ah, I tried practising it, but.

540
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,283
I didn't have enough time.

541
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,316
I felt like and it's like.

542
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,333
If I want to do it right.

543
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,483
I got to do it right, you know? So

544
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,950
maybe, maybe another,

545
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,533
another time for another day
in the near future.

546
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,416
I can learn right on time.

547
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,066
Right on time.

548
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:43,033
Not bad up, but da da da da.

549
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:44,583
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

550
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,816
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

551
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,066
So your next.

552
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,566
One is.

553
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:53,050
If you put it on before we sing it

554
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:56,650
Plus the glove.

555
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:57,816
Yeah.

556
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:01,183
On my favourites.

557
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,300
I I think my top to say

558
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,483
pop songs are plastic glove ends on

559
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,333
and stay with me

560
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:10,966
oh, my God.

561
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:13,750
Thank you so much for all the donations,
guys, and for the gifts subs.

562
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:16,233
I promise I'll get to it after we're done.

563
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:17,883
Thank you so much.

564
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:21,283
Yeah. OK.

565
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:22,416
Yes, a second.

566
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,116
Plastic love

567
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:31,833
Here we go.

568
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,900

OK.

571
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:05,533
Still nervous, but

572
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,266
we got the this.

573
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,550
We got this.

574
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,666
bara

575
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,500

576
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,116
突然の

00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:35,533
キスや

579
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,216
熱いまなざしで

580
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,283
恋のプロ

581
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:43,983
グラムを

582
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:46,983
~

583
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,633
狂わせないでね

584
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,566
出逢いと別れ上

585
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,666
手に

586
00:39:55,666 --> 00:40:02,416
打ち込んで

587
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,166
時間がくれば終わる Don't hurry!

588
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,383
愛に傷ついた

589
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:18,033
あの日からずっと

590
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,733
昼と夜が逆の

591
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,283
暮らしを続けて

592
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:30,433
はやりのDiscoで

593
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:35,950
踊り明かすうちに

594
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:39,133
おぼえた魔術

595
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:43,500
なのよ I'm sorry!

596
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,850
私のことを

597
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,316
決して本気で愛さ

598
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:59,983
ないで 恋なんてただの

599
00:41:00,383 --> 00:41:04,150
ゲー ム 楽しめば

600
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,483
それでいいの

601
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:12,133
閉ざした心を飾る

602
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:16,066
派手なドレスも靴も

603
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:20,250
孤独な友だち

604
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,133
私を誘う

605
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:48,250
人は皮肉なものね いつも

606
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:52,266
彼に似てるわなぜか

607
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:56,166
思い出と

608
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,566
重なり合う

609
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:03,433
グラスを落として急に

610
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:08,650
涙ぐんでも わけは

611
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:13,366
尋ねないでね

612
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:19,500
夜更けの高速で

613
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:24,116
眠りにつくころ

614
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:28,783
ハロゲンライトだけ

615
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,033
妖しく輝く

616
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:36,550
氷のように

617
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:43,450
冷たい女だと

618
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:47,850
ささやく声がしても

619
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:51,033
Don't worry

620
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm just playing games

621
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,983
I know that's plastic love

622
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:03,783
dance to the plastic beat

623
00:43:03,783 --> 00:43:10,033

624
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:14,283

625
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:20,083
I know that's plastic love

00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:24,666
Dance to the plastic beat

627
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:29,600
Another morning comes

00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:35,233
I'm just
playing games I know that's plastic love

629
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:41,283
Dance to the plastic beat

630
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:47,683
another morning comes

631
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:51,550
I'm just playing games

632
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:57,016
I know that's plastic love

633
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:03,216
dance to plastic beat another morning

634
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:16,050

Pog. OK

637
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:26,350
I love that song so much.

638
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,200
I love it so much yeah

639
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,383
I'm just.

640
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:33,516
~dude

641
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,483
Oh, my God.

642
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:37,816
Plastic love will forever
be like top tier,

643
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,383
top tier song

644
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:43,983
all ever listen to your answer sing, man.

645
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,850
And they stay with me.

646
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,016
They're just so fucking good.

647
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:49,033
Oh, yeah.

648
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,133
I forgot to ah to ask.

649
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:51,933
Because I'm a

650
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:54,316
Dumb arse. ah the volume sounds

651
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:58,150
OK, cause I forgot to ask that.

652
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,616
After the first song.

653
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:00,900
Does it need any adjusting?

654
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,533
I too quiet am I too loud?

655
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,716
Do I sound OK? Sounds sounds fine.

656
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,916
I think. Sounds fine.

657
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:07,750
It's perfect.

658
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,050
OK, nice. Thank you.

659
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,450
I don't really change it too much, but,
you know,

660
00:45:13,483 --> 00:45:16,750
I just want to make sure
it wasn't like too loud or too quiet.

661
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,416
I don't want to, like, overpower the
the music

662
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:22,983
I don't want to like

663
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,200
Sounds too quiet, either.

664
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,783
So, yeah, that one was plastic love.

665
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,383
I do the, I do the.

666
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:41,166
Song a lot on the stream just because
it's, you know, it's a comfort song.

667
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,666
It's something that I'm.

668
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:45,066
It's like
when you go to McDonald's. Right?

669
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:49,533
And you get like the ten piece chicken
nuggets or like maybe you get the fries.

670
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,966
It's like the equivalent for me.

671
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,183
It's like my, my nuggets and fries,

672
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:55,783
essentially

673
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,233
so that's all I like.

674
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,866
That's all I get
doing it a lot for everybody.

675
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:05,950
Yeah, I do.

676
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,466
Payphone? Payphone.

677
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,233
I think that might be
a little too high for me.

678
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:13,716
I've I'm not a pay phone.

679
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:14,316
Yeah, no, no.

680
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,816
I don't think I can do it today.

681
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,533
It's, like, really, really high.

682
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:21,133
A lot of songs that I have prepared
don't go to too much.

683
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:21,883
And also, Maroon Five

684
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,800
just has insane range, bro.

685
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,116
My God.

686
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,466
One of these days I'll.

687
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:30,183
Be able
to, you know, increase my range that far.

688
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:32,316
Something that I really.

689
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:34,233
Wish I could do

690
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,066
is like.

691
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:38,533
I really wish I could share.

692
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:42,333
Recordings of when I used to sing back,
like, in back then,

693
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:45,283
because I used to practise a lot in the,
you know,

694
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:48,583
just record my shitty ...,

695
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:52,816
you know, practise sessions
when I was a lot younger.

696
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:56,383
So I wish I could, like,
do a comparison before

697
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:58,716
and like with now
just to see how much I've grown

698
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:02,316
because there's like so many songs
that I wasn't able to like reach the,

699
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:05,616
the right range and stuff, but I'm just
oh no.

700
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:07,183
I'm proud that we are able to

701
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,383
light switch Japanese version.

702
00:47:11,383 --> 00:47:14,416
Oh my God, wait,
I've been addicted to that.

703
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,183
to that song recently, but I don't think I

704
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:22,683
how does it how does it go again?

705
00:47:22,733 --> 00:47:24,583
Those are

706
00:47:25,716 --> 00:47:27,600
mm hmm.

707
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:30,750
How did it go again?

708
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,400
真夜中の「もしもし」どいう意味？わかんない

709
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:37,716
それでも電話を取った　yeah

710
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,383
いつも

711
00:47:41,383 --> 00:47:43,266
恋人ふりをして

712
00:47:43,266 --> 00:47:44,333
恋遊び

713
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,200
が好きだけ

714
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,766
That's a.

715
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:49,516
It's a really nice song.

716
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,816
Oh, maybe next time. Fuck.

717
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:52,716
That's a really good one.

718
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:56,266
Good suggestion, but I don't think I can
you know, do today,

719
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:00,033
because it's, you know, Japanese lyrics
take some time to learn

720
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,166
君に　

721
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,866
魅力

722
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,116
された 今回が最後

723
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:11,916
だって　何度も 言ったのに

724
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,083
I think that's how it goes, right?

725
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:14,683
And then that's all I.

726
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,900
Know because that's like,

727
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,350
you know, the parts I hear the most
on like tik-tok and shit

728
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:25,833
OK. Oh, for the for the next song. Mm.

729
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:29,116
I don't know which I do or which I do.

730
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:32,133
I'm like looking at my list right now. Uh,

731
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,816
you know,

732
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,133
I might try.

733
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,516
This out.

734
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:42,933
Because. Ah.

735
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:44,583
Yeah, I'll try this out.

736
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:45,466
It's, um.

737
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,383
It's an English song.

738
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:49,633
Yeah, this one is an English song.

739
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:50,933
and.

740
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,466
I. I thought about it a lot.

741
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:59,650
Because I have a lot of,
you know, people in China that call me.

742
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:05,133
Like, they call me Baobei and people say
that Baobei means treasure, right?

743
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,916
Or something precious. I don't know.

744
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:08,916
So that got me thinking.

745
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,133
I feel like I want to sing

746
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:13,483
something related to that.

747
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,133
And what do you know?

748
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:16,933
There's a song called Treasure.

749
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:20,983
By Bruno Mars that I coincidentally.

750
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:23,700
Also forgot. I knew how to sing. So

751
00:49:24,783 --> 00:49:27,133
I'm going to do that

752
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,666
let's do treasure.

753
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,433
Yeah.

754
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,333
Yeah, baby.

755
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:39,100
That is what you want honey.

756
00:49:40,383 --> 00:49:42,733
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

757
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,083
honey here. Let me treasure you.

758
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,216
OK, here it is.

759
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,933
Uh, huh.

760
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:58,633
OK. I think this is the right one.

761
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,833
Gimme, gimme, gimme attention, baby.

762
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,233
I got to tell you a little
something about yourself.

Ha ha, la.

809
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:06,666
So, yeah,
I thought I was thinking of you guys when.

810
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,916
I figured out, like, oh, treasure,

811
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:13,083
baby, that that's a
this would be a fun one.

812
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:13,816
to do.

813
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:17,650
Oh, fuck, yeah.

814
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,683
You're my treasure.

815
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:22,983
You're my treasure.

816
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:24,966
Let me get some more water.

817
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:25,683
Hold on.

818
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,516
Clean your throat
like that is never a good idea.

819
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,666
I have such a bad habit of doing that
every time.

820
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,516
Don't do what I'm doing. Like, don't do.

821
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:46,033
Like that.

822
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,483
It's not healthy.

823
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:49,633
It's just, like. It's.

824
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:50,200
Habitual.

825
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,583
Like, once you start a habit of it,
it's really hard.

826
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,516
So it's really hard
to break the habit. You know,

827
00:53:58,266 --> 00:54:00,283
you guys enjoy that one.

828
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:03,666
Really? It's. Ah. I. I remember the song.

829
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:07,333
Like, brings me back years ago
because, um.

830
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:10,133
You know, I has a lot of.

831
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,266
A lot of good nostalgia
from, like, early on.

832
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,233
Tons of things, like 20, 12.

833
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,716
It's only 13 years it's ah.

834
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:17,916
It's a very.

835
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,916
You know, feel good but also just,
you know, Bruno Mars songs in general.

836
00:54:22,183 --> 00:54:25,116
It just has that fun vibe.

837
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:26,683
Unless it's like a sad love song.

838
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:27,516
He does

839
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,683
yeah.

840
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:33,466
I haven't,

841
00:54:34,366 --> 00:54:38,316
I don't think I've sang it ever
and except for like years ago.

842
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,833
So like doing this again,

843
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:43,083
it's just, man,

844
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,816
I don't know, it
just brought back that inner

845
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,883
child, I guess.

846
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:49,533
Like,

847
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,833
I'm just listening to the radio.

848
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,066
I'm singing in the backseat of the car
on a summer day.

849
00:54:57,316 --> 00:55:01,683
This is going to game driven to my
cousin's house or something like that.

850
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,666
I don't know.
That's what that's what gives me are

851
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:09,550
memories of mostly OK.

852
00:55:10,066 --> 00:55:16,483
So I wanted to switch over
to a different place for this next song.

853
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,116
So give me a second.

854
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,400
I'm going to change the

855
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:23,266
our location. Yeah.

856
00:55:23,266 --> 00:55:24,216
Good. Ginger location.

857
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:27,033
So be right back, really quickly.
All right. Mm hmm.

858
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,533
Now just give me a second

859
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:50,783
I hope that wasn't sore.

860
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:52,783
You know, it's about

861
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,450
everything looks good.

862
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,816
Yeah.

863
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:59,516
I want to come back here because I.

864
00:56:01,033 --> 00:56:03,666
I think this would fit the vibes
better for the them

865
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:07,150
or the other songs
that I wanted to sing for you guys.

866
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:11,916
I, I do really love my fair

867
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:15,550
share of K-pop or Korean songs.

868
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:17,050
And some.

869
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,200
Recently, I attempted to sing spring day.

870
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,466
I know you guys probably saw on Twitter,

871
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:26,500
and I did upload a
small version on YouTube, but

872
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:30,516
I wanted to learn the whole song,

873
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,000
and that's exactly what I did.

874
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,166
I learnt more except for the raw portions
because I'm not that good at rap yet.

875
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:41,733
I've learnt that I did
that the entirety of it or like

876
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:45,966
as much as I could of spring day

877
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:48,733
and so I thought be a good idea
to share that with you

878
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:51,916
since it became one of my favourite songs.

879
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:53,266
While it is.

880
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:57,066
Currently one of my favourite songs
because I learnt about it not too long ago

881
00:56:57,066 --> 00:57:01,516
and it's just been, it's been a vibe,
it's been a real good vibe and to,

882
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:04,183
you know, have it on my, have it on my playlist

883
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:10,600
so that is our next song, Spring Day.

884
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,700
It's really fitting too.
because you know why

885
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,633
it's currently Spring
and the gang in the warmer weather.

886
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,850
I'm getting my allergies.

887
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:19,483
Oh my God.

888
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:21,033
I went out yesterday to go to the gym

889
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:25,433
and as soon as I stepped outside
I was sneezing and like wet. But.

890
00:57:25,866 --> 00:57:26,883
It just felt so gross

891
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,133
because like, yeah, there's more.

892
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:32,566
The flowers are really blooming
now and are, you know, is warm.

893
00:57:32,566 --> 00:57:34,750
And then I have appalonology though.

894
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:35,416
Yeah.

895
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:38,583
So I get a little I get the a stuffy nose,

896
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,966
which is not the best when,
you know, you're trying to sing.

897
00:57:42,966 --> 00:57:46,033
So thank God it wasn't yesterday.

898
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,933
OK? Oh, spring day

899
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:53,900
lyrics.

900
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,833

going to Singapore like a few years ago
in Gainesville.

923
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:04,383
I could go through the gardens
by the bay and start seeing the flowers.

924
00:59:04,383 --> 00:59:08,566
There was really something
beautiful in God and I go back again.

925
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:10,083
There are so many flowers there.

926

허공을 떠도는 작은

933
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,766
먼지처럼 작은

934
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:10,333
먼지처럼

935
01:00:11,116 --> 01:00:14,350
날리는 눈이 나라면

936
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:17,866
조금 더 빨리

937
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:22,233
네게 닿을 수 있을 텐데 눈꽃이 떨어져요

938
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:26,783
또 조금씩 멀어져요

939
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,850

만나게 될까

946
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:01,266
추운 겨울 끝을 지나

947
01:01:01,816 --> 01:01:04,783
다시 봄날이 올 때까지

948
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:08,416

불어내 본다 연기처럼

956
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:41,083
하얀 연기처럼

957
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:45,850
말로는 지운다 해도 사실

958
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:51,283
난 아직 널 보내지 못하는데

01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:56,833
눈꽃이 떨어져요 또 조금씩

960
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:59,333
멀어져요

961
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,400

I'm just a big fan of ballads,
I think. Yeah.

1005
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,133
And a song that's just like a ballad
really, really hits for me.

1006
01:03:58,016 --> 01:03:58,583
Mm hmm.

I've sang one of these before.

1016
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:22,066
But I feel like
I could do a little better.

1017
01:04:22,716 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah, I feel like I could do it
a little better than last time.

1018
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:27,850

01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,633
But I never somehow get tired of it.

1080
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:56,200
no honeymoon and gun and no return
and then a gunman again say, are we good?

1081
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,950
Are we bad?

1082
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,050
Eh, what is good or is bad?

1083
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,333
A they get

1084
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,366
there were a honeymoon, a gun and said,
I'm burning than a girl just sick.

1085
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:07,150
Say so many shades of grey.

1086
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:13,750
Took out the mortar saw a saw Oh good.

1087
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,650
Easily fades away I'm bored

1088
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:23,950
and the roots are too much because I love.

1089
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,416
And when they're cursing like a tomato
and more guns

1090
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:32,833
I'll come on
maggots and lying Go love you love

1091
01:08:33,316 --> 01:08:39,316
And I never got to sing God Good Matsumoto
da dum I'm a gun The un and some shit

1092
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:43,500
Chicago is soft
All villains When I go to sing

1093
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:45,133

01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:49,650

1095
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:55,733
We're all villains And then I go to sing
God Give me some love Oh my God.

1096
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,266
And oh dudes and blah.

1097
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:01,783
I'm killing someone
maybe or killing someone

1098
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:06,216
and maybe I'm killing you
who maybe are killing me.

1099
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:11,850
Maybe we are priests
and we're the heroes on the good side

1100
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:15,100
but what if we're the villains
on the other?

1101
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:20,650
We all pretend to be the heroes
on the good side.

1102
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:23,916
But what if we're the villains
on the other.

1103
01:09:25,216 --> 01:09:28,600
We are pretend to be the heroes on

1104
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,416
the good side.

1105
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:38,050
Are I try to go

1106
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,783
for like a cool zooms are in the loft
I think I I've.

1107
01:09:41,283 --> 01:09:43,900
Fucked up on the back. Down.

1108
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:46,566
Got is a hard as.

1109
01:09:46,566 --> 01:09:48,550
Far as hard how does it

1110
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,816
oh the good easily fades away part. Ooh.

1111
01:09:52,116 --> 01:09:56,283
Yeah it's like trying to do a zone change
there is rough

1112
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:59,050
but or like a pitch change
there is rough edges

1113
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,616
I feel like a
I feel like we did a good job

1114
01:10:02,683 --> 01:10:04,950
I feel like I see a job

1115
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:09,816
I love the raw
I think if there's a favourite

1116
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:14,616
part of that song for me it's
definitely the

1117
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:19,033
it's definitely the middle rap.

1118
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:22,333
I love it so much.

1119
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:24,850
It just like it goes, it
just you're such a.

1120
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,833
Good that you could flow so it so it's
not too long, it's not too noisy or short.

1121
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:31,983
It just works.

1122
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,000
They get to day on a. Hunt
and the guns that have been in.

1123
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,466
The gods are sick, sad,

1124
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,583
it's really a

1125
01:10:41,316 --> 01:10:42,216
it's addictive.

1126
01:10:42,216 --> 01:10:43,533
I think that's the word I'm looking for.

1127
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:45,583
Addictive. It's a deal.

1128
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:47,316
Also. Thank you for the hype train, guys.

1129
01:10:47,316 --> 01:10:48,883
Thank you so much.

1130
01:10:49,816 --> 01:10:53,466
I really appreciate all the
the support we're getting tonight.

1131
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:56,733
And like I said before,
I promise I'll read through everything

1132
01:10:56,733 --> 01:10:58,983
at the end of the karaoke session. OK.

1133
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,016
I'll do my best.

1134
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:05,866
Congrats on three energy. Kay.

1135
01:11:05,866 --> 01:11:07,266
Thank you, guys.

1136
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:07,866
You're part of that.

1137
01:11:07,866 --> 01:11:10,333
300 k is like, yo, we were here.

1138
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:13,633
You know, we were. Here.

1139
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:15,133
As me bang my chest.

1140
01:11:15,133 --> 01:11:16,183
It's not a good idea.

1141
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:18,333
That kind of hurt. Oof!

1142
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:22,083
I just it was all

1143
01:11:24,316 --> 01:11:26,050
it was a monkey.

1144
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:28,933
Woo monkey

1145
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,950
been influenced by too many other beats.

1146
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,466
Ubers.

1147
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:38,316
I am like slowly adapting their language
and behavioural rhythms into my own

1148
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:41,500
it's, it's.

1149
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,216
It's not like it's not bad thing,
that thing.

1150
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:44,866
Yeah.

1151
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:49,116
So it's kind of like endearing,
you know. OK.

1152
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:56,383
So, all right, this saw this next song

1153
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,466
I wanted to sing

1154
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:04,083
this next song
is one that I learnt recently

1155
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:07,450
and it was at the request
of another guilty.

1156
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:09,216
Maybe they're in the chat right now.

1157
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:14,616
I'm, I'm not sure but I, I learnt the song
because I remember

1158
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:19,366
promising I could try and I did and.

1159
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:22,933
It's like

1160
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,883
I'm. I'm baffled

1161
01:12:26,883 --> 01:12:29,800
guys that we've come this far.

1162
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:33,883
I know I've said it many times
and it feels like I'm being a dead horse.

1163
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,883
At this point, but I really just cannot

1164
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:39,766
fathom everything you all have given me.

1165
01:12:40,366 --> 01:12:44,083
And many times I've touted my decisions

1166
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,583
I've doubted my self-worth,
I doubt in my efforts.

1167
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:50,533
But every time I have those thoughts

1168
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,616
that seem to cloud my judgement

1169
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:56,383
it's.

1170
01:12:57,783 --> 01:12:59,083
It's always you.

1171
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:03,666
All that helped pull me from it
and make me realise

1172
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:06,616
that you're all very much here.

1173
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,733
You're, you're all

1174
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:13,666
some of the kindest
and most supportive souls I've had

1175
01:13:14,716 --> 01:13:20,766
the honour to call my guild members,
and it really hasn't been easy since.

1176
01:13:20,883 --> 01:13:22,900
Sometimes I do feel like

1177
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:27,550
I'm on my own
as an independent streamer, but.

1178
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:29,433
It's like an art.

1179
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:32,200
It's an obstacle
I'm learning to surmount every day.

1180
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,183
And I. Have.

1181
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:38,983
Good friends, I have like really good
friends that convince me otherwise.

1182
01:13:38,983 --> 01:13:44,133
And it's because of you guys
and it's because of my dear friends

1183
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:48,033
that I'm reminded of that

1184
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:51,366
I'm reminded of that fervent love.

1185
01:13:51,366 --> 01:13:55,066
And I owe you the world's

1186
01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:59,133
I owe you guys the world for making me
live what feels like a dream.

1187
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:00,616
And for

1188
01:14:00,616 --> 01:14:03,616
the longest I could remember,
I've always wanted to

1189
01:14:04,966 --> 01:14:08,433
make people happy while enjoying things.

1190
01:14:08,433 --> 01:14:10,266
Something I, I love to do.

1191
01:14:10,266 --> 01:14:13,116
And this felt perfect.

1192
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:16,633
And it felt more than right. And

1193
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:19,383
it's all because of you

1194
01:14:19,383 --> 01:14:23,683
and your support
that I could be here right now.

1195
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,516
Streaming every day as often as I do
in the mornings.

1196
01:14:27,933 --> 01:14:31,783
And. In the nights
to give everyone a chance to see me live.

1197
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,466
And it understand

1198
01:14:35,466 --> 01:14:38,083
how much I think about you guys like

1199
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:42,933
and how much I love you all for helping me
be who I am.

1200
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:48,100
Like despite all the milestones.

1201
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:52,533
And we just keep continuing
to grow bigger and bigger by the day.

1202
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:55,183
And I just.

1203
01:14:55,183 --> 01:14:57,916
I see how much love you all
put into the community,

1204
01:14:58,233 --> 01:15:02,466
all the fan arts,
all the all the support of comments.

1205
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:06,683
Every time you show up, every time you're
here, every time you come in, it's simply

1206
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,150
it's just

1207
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:09,900
it's amazing.

1208
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,400
And I really I really.

1209
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,550
Couldn't smile harder at the thought

1210
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,433
of being blessed to see this every day.

1211
01:15:18,816 --> 01:15:21,633
And I never want to let that go.

1212
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:25,833
I really I
I don't want to let it go, ever.

1213
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:29,683
And one day I hope that

1214
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:33,100
I can learn to see myself

1215
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,383
as you all see me maybe,

1216
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:40,050
and know why you continue to support

1217
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:44,616
this dumb boy who screams a lot so much.

1218
01:15:44,616 --> 01:15:46,150
And is what, Suzie?

1219
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:47,266
24, seven.

1220
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:50,283
One day I'll know, but I'm getting there.

1221
01:15:50,283 --> 01:15:51,483
I promise.

1222
01:15:52,183 --> 01:15:53,383
I promise.

1223
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:59,900

01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:03,000

compared to mine, like, in terms of like,
is a I like his ability to sing the song.

01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,550
I known them on my.

1427
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,600
Yeah, I think

1428
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:17,666
like the first day for
that was really cute and fun.

1429
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:20,050
Mm. OK.

1430
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:26,200
Oh, I mean, it's a stretch.

1431
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:31,383
It's, I need to stretch my back

1432
01:30:32,733 --> 01:30:34,116
and my neck

1433
01:30:35,766 --> 01:30:37,366
so it doesn't get stuff like I feel.

1434
01:30:37,366 --> 01:30:40,066
Like I tense. Up my entire upper body.

1435
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:43,750
When I sing,
so I need to stretch like everything. Out

1436
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:46,516
so it doesn't get, like, all knotted up.

1437
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:49,600
All right, that's bad for me.

1438
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,333
Mm hmm.

1439
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:51,733
I sing.

1440
01:30:51,733 --> 01:30:54,466
Nicole. Nicole, I dash.

1441
01:30:55,066 --> 01:30:56,233
You mean Nicole by this?

1442
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:58,533
All My God, that's
that's another hard one.

1443
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,600
You know, I'll add that to the list.

1444
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,516
Maybe we can try and learn it someday.

1445
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,100
And what's a really good song?

1446
01:31:07,683 --> 01:31:08,766
I look it up

1447
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,266

Oh, no, that's not it.

1451
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:26,433
Oh, there it is.

1452
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,483
No, I can't find it.

1453
01:31:30,483 --> 01:31:32,083
Ah, Vine.

01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,483
Oh, it's. Song you're talking about.

1455
01:31:34,983 --> 01:31:36,516
His voice is magical till

1456
01:31:36,516 --> 01:31:39,100
and the song is just really good

1457
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,700
in my circulation.

1458
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,866
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1459
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:47,916

1460
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:50,500
OK. Are

1461
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:52,500

01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,650
Mm hmm.

1463
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:54,066
I want to try.

1464
01:31:54,066 --> 01:31:56,050
Something a little different.

1465
01:31:58,116 --> 01:32:01,866
I, I was considering not doing this. One

1466
01:32:02,883 --> 01:32:05,983
and, like, not including it, but I feel.

1467
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:06,700
Like.

1468
01:32:07,033 --> 01:32:08,733
It shouldn't be too bad.

1469
01:32:08,733 --> 01:32:10,966
I. Hmm.

1470
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:11,866
Bear with me.

1471
01:32:11,866 --> 01:32:14,016
I kind of want to give it a shot.

1472
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:15,316
All right. Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

1473
01:32:15,316 --> 01:32:16,983
I'll write it down on the plus, I think.

1474
01:32:16,983 --> 01:32:20,416
I don't know if you guys know this one,
but I know it's known by a different name,

1475
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:22,566
but this is, like,
the one that most people know it by

1476
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:28,133
it's a very short song

1477
01:32:28,133 --> 01:32:33,783

01:39:26,316 --> 01:39:30,366
and I'll make a cup of coffee
with the right amount of sugar.

1606
01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:31,666
I lie.

1607
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:32,433
Yeah,

1608
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:38,200
and I'll make a cup of coffee
with the right amount of sugar.

1609
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,433
How you like it?

1610
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,233
I know I can

1611
01:39:47,116 --> 01:39:49,183

1612
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:52,750
I'll stay for Itzhak?

1613
01:39:53,066 --> 01:39:55,266
Knock on your door.

1614
01:39:55,266 --> 01:39:58,783
Won't you come down and get me.

1615
01:39:59,316 --> 01:40:04,900
I like when you call me I

1616
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:08,550
you make me feel nice

1617
01:40:09,433 --> 01:40:13,816
The cream in your eyes makes me feel warm.

1618
01:40:13,816 --> 01:40:16,883
Inside I

1619
01:40:18,066 --> 01:40:18,550
And I'll.

1620
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,416
Make a cup.

1621
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:20,833
Of coffee with the right.

1622
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:23,266
Amount The sugar I get

1623
01:40:25,266 --> 01:40:26,616

1624
01:40:26,616 --> 01:40:27,583

OK, there's your coffee.

There is your coffee.

1629
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:55,266
I love the I love this song
so I like it comes from the analogue.

1630
01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:58,566
People know it better from like the rap
that this was sampled from.

1631
01:40:59,183 --> 01:40:59,816
Right?

1632
01:41:00,183 --> 01:41:01,416
Like this the.

1633
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:03,733
Rap assembled this VI arm.

1634
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,866
And it's I just.

1635
01:41:05,866 --> 01:41:08,883
Like chill chill vibes.

1636
01:41:08,883 --> 01:41:13,233
It is I sense so much
but I'll never get tired of it.

1637
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:16,750
And hey, it's kind of ironic, though.

1638
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,816
I don't really drink coffee
like coffee for it's

1639
01:41:18,816 --> 01:41:22,866
not like I don't drink coffee
and e I like the song though.

1640
01:41:24,433 --> 01:41:27,333
I feel like I could go for a Oh yeah.

1641
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:29,233
Was it that awful gato thingy.

1642
01:41:29,233 --> 01:41:31,000
I'll have to try one day.

1643
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,683
That sounds really good.

1644
01:41:33,033 --> 01:41:35,016
I do that tomorrow.

1645
01:41:35,566 --> 01:41:36,400
You guys reminded me.

1646
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,700
I think I want to try. Hold on.

1647
01:41:39,783 --> 01:41:40,233
I know what?

1648
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:42,583
I wanted to offer
some point coffee in there, but.

1649
01:41:43,566 --> 01:41:47,350
This is a song that I think.

1650
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,333
Everybody. Knows.

1651
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:51,100
If you don't know this song, then

1652
01:41:51,433 --> 01:41:54,366
I feel like of what are you doing?

1653
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:59,016
It's so it's a very.

1654
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:01,183
It's very simple,

1655
01:42:01,183 --> 01:42:03,700
but I don't know. I

1656
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:09,033
I wanted to try it here.

1657
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,566
Here, now.

1658
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:14,950
As it comes from a good movie,
a really good movie

1659
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:18,316

A friend in me.

1666
01:42:54,066 --> 01:42:56,650
You've got a friend in me.

1667
01:42:58,533 --> 01:43:00,616
When the road looks

1668
01:43:00,616 --> 01:43:04,883
rough ahead and miles and miles from nice.

1669
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:08,766
When did you just remember what your.

1670
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,066

01:43:10,066 --> 01:43:13,033
Boy, you've got a friend in me.

1672
01:43:14,233 --> 01:43:17,200
Yeah, you've got a friend in me.

1673
01:43:18,133 --> 01:43:21,566
But da da da da da da

1674
01:43:21,633 --> 01:43:25,483

1676
01:43:29,533 --> 01:43:32,133
You've got a friend in me.

1677
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:36,100
You've got troubles.

1678
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,216
I got him too.

1679
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,933
There isn't anything I.

1680
01:43:39,933 --> 01:43:42,366
Wouldn't do for you.

1681
01:43:42,366 --> 01:43:45,450
We stick together and see. It through

1682
01:43:45,516 --> 01:43:48,450
because you've got a friend in me

1683
01:43:49,633 --> 01:43:52,716
Yeah you've got a friend in me

1684
01:43:54,816 --> 01:43:58,566
Some other folks
might be a little bit smarter than I am.

1685
01:43:58,783 --> 01:44:01,183
Bigger and stronger, too.

1686
01:44:03,283 --> 01:44:08,416
But none of them will ever love you
the way that I do.

1687
01:44:08,983 --> 01:44:11,133
It's me and you, boy.

1688
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:13,933
And as the years gone by.

1689
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:18,283
Our friendship will never die.

1690
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,100
You can see.

1691
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:24,133
It's our destiny Nay,

1692
01:44:25,233 --> 01:44:27,333
you've got a friend in me.

1693
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,616
Yeah, you've.

1694
01:44:29,616 --> 01:44:33,166
Got a friend in me.

1695
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:35,683
You've got a friend in me

1696
01:44:37,366 --> 01:44:39,016
The da da da.

1697
01:44:39,016 --> 01:44:41,983
Da da da da da da.

1698
01:44:48,966 --> 01:44:51,733
Oh. I love it so much.

1699
01:44:51,733 --> 01:44:55,633
I love that song so much.

1700
01:44:56,116 --> 01:44:57,366
It makes me want to rewatch Toy.

1701
01:44:57,366 --> 01:44:58,333
Story.

1702
01:44:58,933 --> 01:45:01,833
Shot All Love Toy Story, huh?

1703
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,533
It's. Oh, it's a really grown man.

1704
01:45:05,533 --> 01:45:06,666
I don't think anyone can complain.

1705
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:09,216
It's just a feel. It's.

1706
01:45:09,216 --> 01:45:10,566
Oh, it makes me.

1707
01:45:10,566 --> 01:45:12,516
Happy.
It's always something makes me happy, man.

1708
01:45:12,516 --> 01:45:14,500
As one of my first thoughts as Disney
movie still.

1709
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,133
All right.

1710
01:45:15,133 --> 01:45:17,233
Like, I don't think anybody hasn't.

1711
01:45:17,233 --> 01:45:19,533
Seen Toy Story. Before. I.

1712
01:45:19,533 --> 01:45:22,033
I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it
before.

1713
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,533
Or, like, knows of it
or doesn't not know of it.

1714
01:45:25,983 --> 01:45:27,666
Am I freezing that
right? English? I don't know.

1715
01:45:34,866 --> 01:45:37,183
You got a friend in me.

1716
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:39,933
You got a cock in me.

1717
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:42,366
OK, that's enough.

1718
01:45:42,366 --> 01:45:44,983
Curse the content. Huh?

1719
01:45:44,983 --> 01:45:47,116
So for these

1720
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:53,583
it's all for this next song.

1721
01:45:55,066 --> 01:45:56,433
So on

1722
01:45:58,783 --> 01:45:59,983
oh, boy.

1723
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:02,800
Well, now, knowing that no one heard that.

1724
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:03,616
No one heard that.

1725
01:46:03,616 --> 01:46:04,066
Clip it out.

1726
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,866
Clip it out to the other side.

1727
01:46:05,866 --> 01:46:06,816
Thank you.

1728
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:09,883
You rhythm lads.

1729
01:46:09,883 --> 01:46:13,233
You fool in the harnesses, don't you?

1730
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:15,183
Oh, God.

1731
01:46:15,183 --> 01:46:17,716
I don't think I. Can do it today.

1732
01:46:17,716 --> 01:46:20,050
Not to kick you.

1733
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:24,400
That's mean knock on who the he car game

1734
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,066
or your key meet in the.

1735
01:46:29,283 --> 01:46:32,533
And think I'm no match today.

1736
01:46:32,683 --> 01:46:34,750
I would really like to do it next time.

1737
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,800
I've done it before.

1738
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,383
We've done it
before. On the last karaoke session.

1739
01:46:38,566 --> 01:46:41,266
When we had our white day or that. Yeah,

1740
01:46:43,633 --> 01:46:46,266
but I think I'll

1741
01:46:47,633 --> 01:46:48,733
you know, we got like

1742
01:46:48,733 --> 01:46:51,933
two more songs that I want to do.

1743
01:46:51,933 --> 01:46:52,600
Yeah.

1744
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,733
My God has already been almost two.

1745
01:46:54,733 --> 01:46:57,100
What the heck, guys?

1746
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,566
It's three, almost 2 hours.

1747
01:46:58,566 --> 01:47:01,000
What's how

1748
01:47:05,866 --> 01:47:06,516
got that.

1749
01:47:06,516 --> 01:47:09,033
Down that flew by man.

1750
01:47:10,533 --> 01:47:12,783
Yeah, that really flew by so fast.

1751
01:47:12,783 --> 01:47:17,566
OK, then I'm going to switch over
to our last location night.

1752
01:47:17,566 --> 01:47:18,816
We're going to go somewhere else.

1753
01:47:18,816 --> 01:47:21,816
Let's get out this saw this little flower

1754
01:47:21,816 --> 01:47:24,783
field, the sakura blossom area.

1755
01:47:25,066 --> 01:47:26,283
I'm to take you somewhere else.

1756
01:47:26,283 --> 01:47:28,266
OK, baby.

1757
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,233
Mm hmm. Hmm.

1758
01:47:57,516 --> 01:48:02,466
OK, been here before.

1759
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:03,516
You guys remember?

1760
01:48:03,516 --> 01:48:04,116
Right

1761
01:48:06,966 --> 01:48:07,600
and you hear that?

1762
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,116
It's the,
ah, the crickets and all that stuff.

1763
01:48:13,716 --> 01:48:14,650
The moon, right?

1764
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,116
Yeah. You see that moon?
You see that moon?

1765
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:20,466
If you can guess what I'm guessing
next, huh?

1766
01:48:21,183 --> 01:48:22,366
Yes. I'm guessing next.

1767
01:48:27,066 --> 01:48:29,266
I'm going to give you a little bit
of a different flair this time, though.

1768
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:31,450
Usually I do it like for.

1769
01:48:31,450 --> 01:48:33,616
Me to them

1770
01:48:33,816 --> 01:48:37,366
me play amongst the stars.

1771
01:48:37,783 --> 01:48:40,450
But I want to try a little.

1772
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:43,816
I want to try something different
this time.

1773
01:48:43,816 --> 01:48:46,083
OK, bear with me.

1774
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,916
Now, bear with me for a second.

1775
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:50,883
I'm going to do something

1776
01:48:51,766 --> 01:48:53,800
non-conventional

1777
01:48:54,933 --> 01:48:56,200
all right.

1778
01:48:56,766 --> 01:48:59,166
Well, I don't butcher this

1779
01:49:01,266 --> 01:49:03,066
I wish me luck.

1780
01:49:04,566 --> 01:49:05,533
The sexier version.

1781
01:49:05,533 --> 01:49:07,933
What do you mean, the sexier version?

1782
01:49:18,633 --> 01:49:21,150
Fly me to the moon

1783
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:26,016
and let me play amongst the stars.

1784
01:49:27,133 --> 01:49:29,983
Lemme see what spring is like.

1785
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:35,466
Jupiter serving Mars another.

1786
01:49:35,483 --> 01:49:42,483
But hold my hand. Hmm.

1787
01:49:43,216 --> 01:49:46,783
Another way it's a baby.

1788
01:49:46,783 --> 01:49:49,733
Kiss me and

1789
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:53,400
fill my heart with song

1790
01:49:53,566 --> 01:49:58,333
and let miss sing for evermore

1791
01:49:59,233 --> 01:50:01,750
You will love our love Long for

1792
01:50:01,933 --> 01:50:05,533
all love worship and the saw

1793
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:09,366
and not the words

1794
01:50:09,783 --> 01:50:13,266
Please be true

1795
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:18,183
Enough though Why

1796
01:50:18,183 --> 01:50:22,083
I love you

1797
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:25,600
Fill my heart with song

1798
01:50:25,783 --> 01:50:29,866
And let me say for evermore

1799
01:50:31,983 --> 01:50:35,983
are love long for a love worship

1800
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:41,383
and that song And though I

1801
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:45,433
please be true

1802
01:50:46,933 --> 01:50:49,666
another way it's

1803
01:50:50,716 --> 01:50:56,950
in other words In other words

1804
01:50:57,216 --> 01:51:01,483
I love you

1805
01:51:01,533 --> 01:51:03,933
Oh ha ha.

1806
01:51:06,433 --> 01:51:08,450
Oh you did it

1807
01:51:08,466 --> 01:51:09,666
all so far.

1808
01:51:09,666 --> 01:51:11,233
And that was the violence in L.A.

1809
01:51:11,233 --> 01:51:12,616
more often.

1810
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:15,366
I don't I don't really do.

1811
01:51:15,366 --> 01:51:19,116
All that all that extra flair to it
because I just like to keep it simple.

1812
01:51:19,416 --> 01:51:22,716
But I want to try a different,
you know, style of singing it.

1813
01:51:23,866 --> 01:51:27,283
Let me play amongst the stars.

1814
01:51:29,466 --> 01:51:30,250
That was amazing.

1815
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,116
Thank you.

1816
01:51:33,133 --> 01:51:34,216
You like jazz?

1817
01:51:34,216 --> 01:51:37,383
Don't really said gunshot. OK,

1818
01:51:37,383 --> 01:51:39,283
it's a lot of fun, right?

1819
01:51:39,283 --> 01:51:41,166
I think that's the point of our guys.

1820
01:51:41,166 --> 01:51:44,266
That's the point of karaoke. You know,

1821
01:51:45,433 --> 01:51:47,950
is got to have fun with it.

1822
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:49,983
You have to have fun with it.

1823
01:51:50,116 --> 01:51:50,383
Oh, yeah.

1824
01:51:50,383 --> 01:51:51,283
I'm not having fun with it.

1825
01:51:51,283 --> 01:51:53,566
Then what's the point right?

1826
01:51:53,566 --> 01:51:54,283
Yeah.

1827
01:51:54,683 --> 01:51:59,016
I also hope that you guys
can feel my joy from over there.

1828
01:51:59,316 --> 01:52:00,733
I like I mean, like you're right
next to me.

1829
01:52:00,733 --> 01:52:01,383
We're holding hands.

1830
01:52:01,383 --> 01:52:05,733
I mean, what are.

1831
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:09,066
So this next song

1832
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,266
is going to be.

1833
01:52:11,266 --> 01:52:13,416
Our last song for the night

1834
01:52:15,466 --> 01:52:15,916
it's.

1835
01:52:15,916 --> 01:52:17,383
Yeah, this is going to be our last one.

1836
01:52:17,383 --> 01:52:21,150
And I think we're going to wrap it up
there and just have a small chill

1837
01:52:21,166 --> 01:52:22,900
before we end it off.

1838
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,966
2 hours went by so fast, guys.

1839
01:52:25,966 --> 01:52:29,083
You really did. Wow.

1840
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:34,300
But everything I've said before,
I really does hope.

1841
01:52:34,683 --> 01:52:39,883
I hope that rings true and that you guys
hold it near and dear to your dear hearts.

1842
01:52:39,883 --> 01:52:41,566
Because, I mean, what I said

1843
01:52:41,566 --> 01:52:44,583
this next song holds
the weight of my feelings to each and

1844
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:47,650
every one of you and to the

1845
01:52:47,833 --> 01:52:51,466
future guild members that join our home
in some sample for a bite.

1846
01:52:51,816 --> 01:52:55,416
I want to sing it again
since it has a special meaning to me.

1847
01:52:55,533 --> 01:52:59,700
And there's a lyric in the song
that translates roughly to

1848
01:53:00,133 --> 01:53:03,066
I'll pluck the stars from the sky
and give them to you,

1849
01:53:03,316 --> 01:53:05,350
my galaxy and

1850
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:08,533
I never

1851
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:12,666
like to think much about the future

1852
01:53:12,966 --> 01:53:16,150
because. I'm.

1853
01:53:17,316 --> 01:53:19,816
I'm a person that loves to live
in the moments

1854
01:53:19,816 --> 01:53:23,716
and enjoy today rather than worry
about some all all the time.

1855
01:53:24,283 --> 01:53:27,766
But I know that there will be battles,

1856
01:53:27,766 --> 01:53:33,066
struggles and obstacles for not only me,
but for all of us.

1857
01:53:33,066 --> 01:53:36,516
And I mean, that's normal in the quest,
right?

1858
01:53:37,233 --> 01:53:40,516
In any journey or adventure, it's
never a straight line.

1859
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:41,983
There's always some type of

1860
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:44,316
network like this.

1861
01:53:44,316 --> 01:53:48,516
There's always some type of monster
or side quest or mini boss or chops

1862
01:53:48,516 --> 01:53:49,416
we fall into.

1863
01:53:49,416 --> 01:53:51,133
But that's why
we called an adventure. Right?

1864
01:53:51,133 --> 01:53:52,233
And that's all you guys are part of.

1865
01:53:52,233 --> 01:53:54,366
My no part of our.

1866
01:53:54,816 --> 01:53:57,366
Adventure scaled, and I'm

1867
01:53:57,366 --> 01:54:00,516
growing and I'm learning.

1868
01:54:00,516 --> 01:54:04,266
I'm expanding my skill tree
all the time, every day.

1869
01:54:04,266 --> 01:54:07,866
And I really want to be a better person
every single day.

1870
01:54:07,983 --> 01:54:10,266
And I know I won't be.

1871
01:54:10,266 --> 01:54:12,333
Able to please everybody, but.

1872
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:13,716
I've never.

1873
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,716
Had such a

1874
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:19,666
I've never had such a strong desire

1875
01:54:20,416 --> 01:54:22,783
to make myself

1876
01:54:23,916 --> 01:54:26,866
a better version of myself

1877
01:54:26,866 --> 01:54:29,466
than I was yesterday before.

1878
01:54:30,033 --> 01:54:33,100
And so I met all of you guys

1879
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,716
and all my precious friends. And,

1880
01:54:36,766 --> 01:54:40,900
I mean, I'm still young as hell,
and I'm still trying to learn the world.

1881
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:45,766
And, I mean, we all are in some way,
whether we're ten, 20, 50, or even like

1882
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:48,850
206 year old elves.

1883
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,866
If you guys are out there by

1884
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:55,450
I. I.

1885
01:54:56,983 --> 01:55:00,033
I want to try and

1886
01:55:00,033 --> 01:55:02,500
be an inspiration

1887
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:06,250
to as many people as I can,
and it feels like

1888
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:09,550
that's my duty
as your guild leader as well.

1889
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:13,983
And I want to help you all realise
how far you can go as well and

1890
01:55:15,766 --> 01:55:18,283
to be at your happiest.

1891
01:55:18,466 --> 01:55:21,100
And I hope I can help you guys get there

1892
01:55:21,166 --> 01:55:22,533
and realise it

1893
01:55:25,933 --> 01:55:27,966
This next song is called Galaxy

1894
01:55:31,366 --> 01:55:33,183
Song and before and that song.

1895
01:55:33,183 --> 01:55:33,916
It's a good one.

I love it so much.

1897
01:55:37,716 --> 01:55:38,766

that comfortable with song so fast.

1960
02:00:07,533 --> 02:00:08,616
They can like, you know, free.

1961
02:00:08,616 --> 02:00:09,516
Myself.

1962
02:00:14,316 --> 02:00:16,116
Oh man.

1963
02:00:19,266 --> 02:00:21,066
I really

1964
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:24,616
I feel so lucky to have

1965
02:00:25,633 --> 02:00:27,966
all of you here and

1966
02:00:27,966 --> 02:00:31,416
be grace
by for quite possibly the best community

1967
02:00:31,633 --> 02:00:33,966
I could ever ask for.

1968
02:00:36,466 --> 02:00:37,100
Yeah.

1969
02:00:38,883 --> 02:00:41,700
I love my guilty so much

1970
02:00:43,366 --> 02:00:44,866
thank you so much for listening.

1971
02:00:44,866 --> 02:00:46,450
So all my songs.

1972
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,366
Yeah, that was my last one.

1973
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:49,216
I don't want to overdo it.

1974
02:00:49,216 --> 02:00:52,900
I can feel like again I can feel my throat
getting a little bit raspy.

1975
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,566
And at that point,
I think it's better to just, like,

1976
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:58,666
hold it there and not, you know,

1977
02:00:58,666 --> 02:01:00,400
overdo anything

1978
02:01:02,533 --> 02:01:05,350
so I feel like
if I overdo it, it's not all that good.

1979
02:01:05,733 --> 02:01:06,850
I don't wanna.

1980
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:08,016

02:01:12,283 --> 02:01:13,516

02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:14,166
Yeah.

1985
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:18,333
It's never

1986
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:21,816
it's never a good idea to overdo it, guys.

1987
02:01:21,816 --> 02:01:23,433
Never a good idea.

1988
02:01:28,916 --> 02:01:30,166
For all, though.

1989

Sometimes, like.

2106

2111
02:07:08,733 --> 02:07:12,066
that internal, like, struggle, like,
am I doing enough and what's going enough?

as much as I can for everybody.

Oh, my God.

2277
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:36,966
Shuttle's Wolf Squad.

2278
02:13:36,966 --> 02:13:38,633
I don't know something.

02:13:38,633 --> 02:13:39,916
Hmm. You guys got.

2280
02:13:39,916 --> 02:13:40,333

I don't know. What I would say. Huh.

2282
02:13:43,866 --> 02:13:45,800
Sounds like a funny name.

2283
02:13:46,366 --> 02:13:47,200
Wolf.

2284
02:13:47,283 --> 02:13:48,933
I'm not dog, though.

2285
02:13:48,933 --> 02:13:51,700
It sounds. You know, just

2286
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:53,416
because, like I say this every time,

2287
02:13:53,416 --> 02:13:55,916
just because I bark, because I know.

2288
02:13:56,883 --> 02:13:58,183
Because I.

2289
02:13:58,216 --> 02:14:00,883
You know, it doesn't mean I'm a dog.

2290
02:14:01,516 --> 02:14:03,400
Do you see ears anywhere?
I don't think so.

2291
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,600
And you guys can't put any ears.

Is your first time
catching up your karaoke?

2297
02:14:13,716 --> 02:14:15,816
Oh, OK. Lack of class, dude.

2298
02:14:15,816 --> 02:14:17,116
Pay attention in class. Don't.

2299

02:21:59,266 --> 02:22:01,266
puff thank you for the AIDS. Oh, no.

2481
02:22:01,266 --> 02:22:03,700
Congratulations.
You're glad to be part of the guild.

2482
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:07,200
Every day of your life is full of joy
and hope and you really hope

2483
02:22:07,216 --> 02:22:10,450
to enjoy the time with me
and learning English from my stream.

2484
02:22:10,633 --> 02:22:11,466
I don't think.

2485
02:22:11,466 --> 02:22:12,166
Learning English

2486
02:22:12,166 --> 02:22:16,516
or my friend is the best idea,
but if it helps, then, hey, I'm glad it.

2487
02:22:16,566 --> 02:22:17,383
It's been helping

2488
02:22:18,783 --> 02:22:19,716
I do want to

2489
02:22:19,716 --> 02:22:23,266
say, like, if you do want to learn more,
you know, English,

2490
02:22:24,466 --> 02:22:25,900
I hope all your schools are teaching.

2491
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:27,400
You are like you take classes.

2492
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:27,966
Have like the best.

2493
02:22:27,966 --> 02:22:30,216
Ways to take classes and like,
you hit the textbook still.

2494
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,983
That's why I want to. Try and learn.

2495
02:22:32,983 --> 02:22:35,083
I try and learn Japanese very soon.

2496
02:22:35,533 --> 02:22:36,550
I got to get.

2497
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:38,983
Go get those textbooks. Man.

2498
02:22:38,983 --> 02:22:40,833
That's the first language I'm tackling.

2499
02:22:40,833 --> 02:22:43,983
And then now I know I want to try Mandarin
as well.

2500
02:22:44,466 --> 02:22:46,816
Mandarin Chinese and so

2501
02:22:47,416 --> 02:22:51,216
and so what else I think

2502
02:22:51,216 --> 02:22:52,750
brush up on Spanish again.

2503
02:22:52,750 --> 02:22:54,316
I really do want to do more Spanish.

2504
02:22:54,316 --> 02:22:57,733
Spanish is a fucking awesome
language, man.

2505
02:22:57,733 --> 02:22:58,816
It makes sense.

2506
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:00,666
English doesn't make sense.

2507
02:23:00,666 --> 02:23:05,200
The Spanish when I learnt it in
high school or like part of it, I forgot.

2508
02:23:05,350 --> 02:23:07,983
It just makes. Sense, man. Like it was

2509
02:23:09,133 --> 02:23:10,516
God bless

2510
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,183
Moyer.

2511
02:23:13,183 --> 02:23:16,300
Vonnie, thank you for the big deal.
No cuts.

2512
02:23:16,483 --> 02:23:19,233

2526
02:23:47,166 --> 02:23:48,133
Oh yeah. That reminds me.

2527
02:23:48,133 --> 02:23:49,183
I don't know if to.

2528
02:23:49,183 --> 02:23:52,516
Shit, we got to finish that, Tony.

2529
02:23:52,516 --> 02:23:54,166
Maybe I'll put that on schedule
for next week

2530
02:23:54,166 --> 02:23:55,483
if I remember

2531
02:23:57,483 --> 02:23:58,533
but she's. She's dead now.

2532
02:23:58,533 --> 02:23:59,416
We killed her, right?

2533
02:24:00,733 --> 02:24:02,650
Yes. See ya.

2534
02:24:02,650 --> 02:24:06,733
See, congratulations on the day
I'll always be there with you.

2535
02:24:06,733 --> 02:24:08,283
Your songs are beautiful.

2536
02:24:08,283 --> 02:24:10,933
Yes, you are wealth. They are treasure.

2537
02:24:10,933 --> 02:24:12,066
Treasure.

2538
02:24:12,066 --> 02:24:14,666
That is what you are. Her.

2539
02:24:15,216 --> 02:24:18,166
Honey, you're my golden star.

2540
02:24:19,466 --> 02:24:20,033
Yeah.

2541
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:21,766
I know.

2542
02:24:21,766 --> 02:24:23,650
It's a great song, man. Our Bruno Mars.

2543
02:24:23,650 --> 02:24:25,433
I feel like I should sing more
Bruno Mars song.

2544
02:24:25,433 --> 02:24:27,433
Still all. Right.

2545
02:24:27,433 --> 02:24:28,050
I'm all right.

2546
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:29,133
Yeah. Yeah, I like you.

2547
02:24:29,133 --> 02:24:32,500
Guys idea of, like, dedicating a stream
to, like, a specific genre

2548
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:35,316
of songs and music,
so I might try and do that.

2549
02:24:35,883 --> 02:24:38,500
For future karaoke, like,
you know, like rap,

2550
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:41,283
rap, rap, karaoke. Or.

2551
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:45,533
Or K-pop karaoke or, you know, um,

2552
02:24:46,366 --> 02:24:50,200
just sad love songs or something
like that.

2553
02:24:50,316 --> 02:24:51,550
Stick to a theme or something.

2554
02:24:51,550 --> 02:24:52,083
Right?

2555
02:24:54,483 --> 02:24:54,883
Oh, girl.

2560
02:25:03,483 --> 02:25:06,016
So sorry. Sorry I stay here,
but you have to go to work.

2561
02:25:06,250 --> 02:25:06,666
I'll be over.

2562
02:25:06,666 --> 02:25:09,100
Great. Simon, I really enjoyed
seeing listening to you sing.

2563
02:25:09,333 --> 02:25:10,033
You're great.

2564
02:25:10,033 --> 02:25:11,500
You know more.

2565
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:14,733
You thank you for listening and zahava.

2566
02:25:15,466 --> 02:25:17,766
Wow. Have a good day at work.

2567
02:25:17,766 --> 02:25:18,700
I can't talk.

2568
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:21,433
Wow. I'm like, my work

2569
02:25:21,433 --> 02:25:21,700
also.

2570
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:24,583
Yeah, I think a lot of people didn't know,
but I do like rapping.

2571
02:25:24,583 --> 02:25:27,400
I do like rap music a lot.

2572
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:29,316
I listen to it a lot
when I. Go to the gym.

2573
02:25:29,316 --> 02:25:32,383
It's like my motivation, music it's like,

2574
02:25:32,533 --> 02:25:34,450
get shit done.

2575
02:25:35,616 --> 02:25:38,116
Rap music is awesome, and I don't.

2576
02:25:38,116 --> 02:25:40,183
I'm just. I suck at it.

2577
02:25:40,183 --> 02:25:43,683
There's like one rap from a native, sir,
that I wanted to learn.

2578
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:47,883
Those are from like a collaboration
or something like that.

2579
02:25:47,883 --> 02:25:49,366
You're more Sagar Kimmy.

2580
02:25:49,366 --> 02:25:52,983
Only you're more Su Sakura.

2581
02:25:53,416 --> 02:25:55,916
Keep me on my feet.

2582
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,166
Yeah, and he did it often.

2583
02:25:59,166 --> 02:26:01,183
That's, you know, and

2584
02:26:02,416 --> 02:26:04,300
it sounds like all on life.

2585
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:05,016
Find it

2586
02:26:08,883 --> 02:26:09,916
just stay the same.

2587
02:26:09,916 --> 02:26:10,716
It sounds really good.

2588
02:26:10,716 --> 02:26:13,016
I wish I had seen it in the past.

2589
02:26:13,833 --> 02:26:15,066
You know I hate you.

2590
02:26:15,066 --> 02:26:18,466
Yeah, it's,
ah, it's a really intense rap, but.

2591
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:21,550
I feel like that is my goal, bro.

2592
02:26:21,816 --> 02:26:24,166
That's like the top of.

2593
02:26:24,216 --> 02:26:28,333
My list
priority of trying to cover this song

2594
02:26:29,583 --> 02:26:32,350
with a friend in the future.

2595
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:35,350
If I once I learn, like, you know,
get more comfortable with, like, actually

2596
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:37,416
doing rap in both, like,
English and Japanese,

2597
02:26:40,083 --> 02:26:41,266
not suit darker.

2598
02:26:41,266 --> 02:26:43,866
I thank you for this honour to educate.

2599
02:26:43,866 --> 02:26:44,800
Congrats all day.

No problem.

I, I think it was right
talking about treasure.

2605
02:26:58,233 --> 02:26:59,983
I'm glad you guys love treasure, man.

2606
02:26:59,983 --> 02:27:02,633
That's
that's really good to know. Like this.

2607
02:27:02,883 --> 02:27:04,233
That was kind of like a.

2608
02:27:04,233 --> 02:27:08,000
You know, a curveball in the karaoke
along with Fall on my limo.

2609
02:27:08,266 --> 02:27:10,533
But, yeah, i, i really.

2610
02:27:10,533 --> 02:27:13,800
I'm really glad that treasure
was a favourite of many people.

2611
02:27:15,166 --> 02:27:17,133
You guys are my treasure.

2612
02:27:20,316 --> 02:27:21,366
You, Michael.

2613
02:27:21,366 --> 02:27:23,533
Hui, thank you for the big tell.

2614
02:27:23,533 --> 02:27:25,200
No. Oh, my God.

2615
02:27:25,633 --> 02:27:26,716
Thank you for the karaoke stream.

2616
02:27:26,716 --> 02:27:28,866
Not today. Only I mean every stream.

2617
02:27:28,866 --> 02:27:29,916
I'm very.

2618
02:27:29,916 --> 02:27:32,233
You're you love listening to me sing.

2619
02:27:32,233 --> 02:27:34,416
And your voice makes me relax and heal.

2620
02:27:34,416 --> 02:27:35,133
Don't be shy.

2621
02:27:35,133 --> 02:27:36,583
Your voice is very nice.

2622
02:27:36,583 --> 02:27:39,216
You can't even, like,

2623
02:27:39,483 --> 02:27:41,550
I will always. Like, be shy.

2624
02:27:41,550 --> 02:27:43,266
You know. It's hard sor

2625
02:27:44,283 --> 02:27:46,666
it's hard to get over those nerves,
I guess.

2626
02:27:46,666 --> 02:27:47,433
Like,

2627
02:27:48,133 --> 02:27:50,616
I to I don't think I'll.

2628
02:27:52,216 --> 02:27:54,333
I'll ever get over those nerves.

2629
02:27:54,333 --> 02:27:55,183
Like it's a good thing.

2630
02:27:55,183 --> 02:27:57,583
Like people have that,
you know, positive stress

2631
02:27:58,333 --> 02:28:00,166
before they go into like, something big.

2632
02:28:00,166 --> 02:28:01,233
It's normal.

2633
02:28:01,233 --> 02:28:05,833
But yeah, I was just really shy
because I was worried I would

2634
02:28:07,183 --> 02:28:09,166
the songs went, like, fuck up real

2635
02:28:09,166 --> 02:28:12,166
hard on a song or something like that.

2636
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:14,433
But I'm glad to know, like.

2637
02:28:14,433 --> 02:28:17,733
You know, I didn't, I didn't blunder
anything and it went really well.

2638
02:28:19,633 --> 02:28:21,100
Fiona Hannah see.

2639
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:23,766
I did it all. A couple of karaoke ago.

2640
02:28:24,216 --> 02:28:28,083
Oh, nurse, thank you for the $300.

2641
02:28:28,416 --> 02:28:30,666
Ah, congratulations on 300 k.

2642
02:28:30,933 --> 02:28:33,066
I promise I will stay here
as long as I can.

2643
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:34,750
And you shine so bright today.

2644
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:37,266
Oh, oh,

2645
02:28:38,116 --> 02:28:40,183
oh, oh.

2646
02:28:40,183 --> 02:28:42,100
Well, that's a sweet message.

2647
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,000
Well, it's

2648
02:28:43,666 --> 02:28:46,333
a shine bright that I really

2649
02:28:46,333 --> 02:28:47,533

2650
02:28:49,416 --> 02:28:50,233
I'm glad you're here.

2651
02:28:50,233 --> 02:28:53,866
Thank you so much for the know, and
I appreciate you listening to my songs.

2652
02:28:55,266 --> 02:28:56,500
I had fun with fire.

2653
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:59,083
I think the one that I enjoyed
the most was probably dry flower.

2654
02:28:59,116 --> 02:29:02,416
Like I said,
I got to go do more dry flower.

2655
02:29:04,333 --> 02:29:07,416
Enzo, thank you for putting the stream
in the community.

2656
02:29:07,416 --> 02:29:09,783
Hypnosis like it means a lot easier.

02:29:09,783 --> 02:29:11,350

2686
02:30:14,833 --> 02:30:15,516
You're doing so great.

2687
02:30:15,516 --> 02:30:17,883

2690
02:30:22,866 --> 02:30:24,133
I should publish the bottle right now.

2691
02:30:24,133 --> 02:30:25,966
But for. Some reason, switch.

2692
02:30:25,966 --> 02:30:28,233
Doesn't want me like,
you know, publish the VOD

2693
02:30:28,233 --> 02:30:31,050
until after the stream is over
for some odd reason.

2694
02:30:31,050 --> 02:30:32,650
So I'm going to

2695
02:30:34,183 --> 02:30:35,583
I think that's just how it's set up now.

2696
02:30:35,583 --> 02:30:37,966
So ill girl.

2697
02:30:37,966 --> 02:30:40,383
So you guys can listen to the
to the songs again

2698
02:30:40,383 --> 02:30:42,933
once I end stream later

2699
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:46,383
a lot of people do I have to head out?

2700
02:30:46,383 --> 02:30:48,016
Yeah. You guys are busy days today.

2701
02:30:48,016 --> 02:30:50,716
It is the morning for some of you. Right.
So have a good day.

2702
02:30:50,766 --> 02:30:53,283
Don't don't feel pressure to stay.
All right.

2703
02:30:53,583 --> 02:30:57,166
Be sure to us your responsibilities
and there will always be the bad.

2704
02:30:57,733 --> 02:30:58,116
Take care.

2705
02:30:58,116 --> 02:30:58,716
All right,

2706
02:30:59,716 --> 02:31:03,516
Amber, thank you for that sonar and saw
it's in the air.

2707
02:31:03,516 --> 02:31:04,433
Think of it. It's online.

2708
02:31:04,433 --> 02:31:07,416
Vampire Popper, the funny name

2709
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:12,016
oh, see?

2710
02:31:12,016 --> 02:31:14,050
That's it, shopper.

2711
02:31:14,166 --> 02:31:15,016
You've killed me.

2712
02:31:15,016 --> 02:31:16,383
I'm on the way to the grave now.

2713
02:31:16,383 --> 02:31:17,800
What did I do?

2714
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:19,150
What did I do? What I do?

2715
02:31:19,150 --> 02:31:21,100
Something bad.
It was it. The songs? I don't know.

2716
02:31:22,416 --> 02:31:23,016
Don't die.

2717
02:31:23,016 --> 02:31:25,833
Please don't die. I'll be sad if you die.

2718
02:31:25,833 --> 02:31:27,033
No, no dying.

2719
02:31:27,033 --> 02:31:28,666
OK, I'll fucking kill.

2720
02:31:28,666 --> 02:31:29,733
You if you die.

2721
02:31:30,966 --> 02:31:33,866
Amamou Thank you for the I'll again. Ah,

2722
02:31:35,133 --> 02:31:36,433

2723
02:31:36,433 --> 02:31:37,816
Thank you for the baked on.

2724
02:31:37,816 --> 02:31:41,466
No, congratulations on the 300
can switch and £400 order.

2725
02:31:41,733 --> 02:31:45,483
Thank you for appearing in my life
and thank you for the karaoke scream.

2726
02:31:46,383 --> 02:31:47,383
There's something that.

2727
02:31:47,383 --> 02:31:49,283
Just hit me in the heart.

2728
02:31:49,283 --> 02:31:53,950
And. On you when people type to thank you
for appearing in my life.

2729
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,716
That's a very sweet line. I don't know.

2730
02:31:56,716 --> 02:31:59,233
It's like the equivalent of saying
thank you for existing,

2731
02:31:59,383 --> 02:32:03,816
I guess, and analogies
means a lot to be appreciated that way.

2732
02:32:03,816 --> 02:32:04,783
Thank you.

2733
02:32:05,466 --> 02:32:06,633
My stomach just rumbled.

2734
02:32:06,633 --> 02:32:08,050
I got to get food after the stream.

2735
02:32:09,816 --> 02:32:10,750
There's a there's some food.

2736
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:12,300
Downstairs, so I got to eat that.
I did not.

2737
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:15,783
Eat before the stream like a dummy
because I wanted to

2738
02:32:15,916 --> 02:32:18,666
just have a short one today.

2739
02:32:19,150 --> 02:32:20,716
So I will eat afterwards.

2740
02:32:20,716 --> 02:32:21,733
No worries.

2741
02:32:22,383 --> 02:32:23,866
My mom has food downstairs.

2742
02:32:23,866 --> 02:32:25,883
Mama, thank you for this. I know, pumpkin.

2743
02:32:25,883 --> 02:32:26,983
I love you.

2744
02:32:26,983 --> 02:32:29,266
Maybe you can hear some Chinese songs
in the future.

2745
02:32:29,433 --> 02:32:32,866
I was considering doing some, but it's
just like I don't know which ones to do.

2746
02:32:32,866 --> 02:32:35,416
I remember my friends did one.

2747
02:32:35,683 --> 02:32:37,216
I was called, like, warrior or.

2748
02:32:37,216 --> 02:32:40,783
Something like that and saw

2749
02:32:40,783 --> 02:32:43,716
I might give that a try,

2750
02:32:43,716 --> 02:32:44,433
so I forgot to turn.

2751
02:32:44,433 --> 02:32:46,900
Alert Box is back on. Sorry about that.

2752
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:49,666
I don't know what it was, but I.

2753
02:32:50,050 --> 02:32:51,666
I want to try and,

2754
02:32:53,083 --> 02:32:56,050
you know, expand the different languages
as well.

2755
02:32:56,283 --> 02:32:59,883
Like other different languages
besides our Japanese and Tsar

2756
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:03,666
and Korean, which are my comforts

2757
02:33:03,666 --> 02:33:05,416
job. I sing a black pink song.

2758
02:33:05,416 --> 02:33:08,166
I love black pink, bro. My God,

2759
02:33:08,166 --> 02:33:08,866
watching cookies.

2760
02:33:08,866 --> 02:33:12,850
K-pop inspired me to,
like, wanted to do more K-pop song style,

2761
02:33:14,466 --> 02:33:15,400
acoustic style.

2762
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:16,666
Most likely.

2763
02:33:16,666 --> 02:33:18,483

You have a good night.

2767

The odds you would hope
it's not too late for you Guru.

2768
02:33:26,166 --> 02:33:28,366
Thank you for the deal. No,

Oh cut off what I weird.

2782
02:34:07,333 --> 02:34:08,316
Right back to my other.

2783
02:34:08,316 --> 02:34:10,066
Point though I was saying.

2784
02:34:11,466 --> 02:34:13,566
I started off.

2785
02:34:13,566 --> 02:34:18,633
As a P&G I never had you know this

2786
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:21,766
I was just you know a pick

2787
02:34:21,816 --> 02:34:23,966
just a picture on the screen and

2788
02:34:25,516 --> 02:34:28,833
going from that to
this has been quite the journey so

2789
02:34:29,650 --> 02:34:34,233
if it means anything, hey
I know exactly where you're coming from.

2790
02:34:34,566 --> 02:34:38,866
I used to be,
you know, really, really small and

2791
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:41,500
now I have so many wonderful

2792
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:45,616
friends and guild members with me
to join me on this wonderful journey.

2793
02:34:45,616 --> 02:34:48,550
So I hope that.

2794
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,433
You can reach

2795
02:34:50,916 --> 02:34:52,966
reach that same happiness that I have.

2796
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:56,266
OK, you got this. Don't don't stop.

2797
02:34:56,266 --> 02:34:57,633
Don't give up.

2798
02:34:57,783 --> 02:34:59,016
Trust me, it gets better.

2799
02:34:59,016 --> 02:35:00,216
It will get better.

2800
02:35:00,216 --> 02:35:00,933
I was in.

2801
02:35:00,933 --> 02:35:06,166
Your shoes like a year ago, a couple of
years ago, and I know what it's like, bro.

2802
02:35:06,166 --> 02:35:07,783
So just keep it to keep at it.

2803
02:35:07,783 --> 02:35:08,500
All right?

2804
02:35:11,466 --> 02:35:13,750
Are on.

2805
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:16,450
You sing very well,
and I can feel the emotions in your song.

2806
02:35:16,833 --> 02:35:20,016
Ah, I listen to your songs to sleep
every day and I have more songs.

2807
02:35:21,016 --> 02:35:23,616
All you guys listen to me sings.

2808
02:35:23,616 --> 02:35:26,266
I got a better lot

2809
02:35:26,266 --> 02:35:29,116
of what you guys listen to me
when you get to bed.

2810
02:35:29,116 --> 02:35:30,516
Oh, my. God. That's sweet.

2811
02:35:31,866 --> 02:35:33,183
I might post.

2812
02:35:33,183 --> 02:35:36,366
A couple of the songs
that we did tonight on my channel.

2813
02:35:36,366 --> 02:35:40,233
Maybe we'll see, because I was a
I was proud of them.

2814
02:35:41,150 --> 02:35:43,383
Wasn't one of them.

2815
02:35:43,383 --> 02:35:44,683
I will see y'all.

2816
02:35:44,683 --> 02:35:45,400
I'll see

2817
02:35:48,833 --> 02:35:50,850
Keith Staples.

2818
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:51,583
Hasn't been long.

2819
02:35:51,583 --> 02:35:52,933
By really love coming to your streams.

2820
02:35:52,933 --> 02:35:55,933
Your voice is always so comforting. Oh.

2821
02:35:55,933 --> 02:35:57,316
My stomach is rumbling a lot.

2822
02:35:57,316 --> 02:36:00,316
Sorry, and always brings
a smile to my face.

2823
02:36:00,316 --> 02:36:03,433
Congrats on 300 K and thank you

02:43:01,816 --> 02:43:02,916
It's such a blessing.

2995
02:43:02,916 --> 02:43:05,766

Zelda
Thank you for the big donor, but $200.

2997
02:43:10,533 --> 02:43:11,683
Thank you for being in my life.

2998
02:43:11,683 --> 02:43:14,116
I really love your voice,
your scream and your smile.

2999
02:43:14,283 --> 02:43:15,283
The screams.

3000
02:43:15,283 --> 02:43:17,316
Thank you for liking the screams.
That's part of the package.

3001
02:43:19,683 --> 02:43:20,283
I mean, you can't.

3002
02:43:20,283 --> 02:43:22,716
You can't sort of
have me without the scream.

3003
02:43:22,716 --> 02:43:25,783
Still, you know,
don't know how long your love will last.

3004
02:43:25,783 --> 02:43:26,316
Bye for now.

3005
02:43:26,316 --> 02:43:30,283
I really, really love you
more than anything else in the world of

3006
02:43:31,716 --> 02:43:32,800
Zelda.

02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:34,716
Princess Zelda them is all that.

3008
02:43:34,716 --> 02:43:35,683
Thank you.

3009
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:40,166
Thank you for the donation and I again. I

3010
02:43:43,233 --> 02:43:44,133
it means a lot.

3011
02:43:44,133 --> 02:43:47,650
Like the not like
the screams are endearing.

3012
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:49,816
I always look at it as, like,
just something that's just.

3013
02:43:49,866 --> 02:43:51,033
Ha ha ha.

3014
02:43:51,033 --> 02:43:53,800
You know, or like, oh, my God,
why do I sound like that?

3015
02:43:54,016 --> 02:43:57,966
But the fact that you said, like,
you love it, it's just really. Huh?

3016
02:43:59,433 --> 02:44:01,183
It sounds like it sounds like a screeching

3017
02:44:01,183 --> 02:44:03,816
tire or a seagull sometimes, but, hey.

3018
02:44:04,483 --> 02:44:07,483
If you like that. Then I'm glad. I'm glad

3019
02:44:09,816 --> 02:44:10,383
recrimination.

3020
02:44:10,383 --> 02:44:12,850
Thank you for that, Donna.
I'll love you, honey.

3021
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:14,350

And, Kenny, thank you for the. All

3025
02:44:19,033 --> 02:44:20,283
I realised your donor.

3026
02:44:20,283 --> 02:44:22,666
Was missing an extra zero. Here you go.

3027
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:26,316
I think you added an extra zero
by accident.

3028
02:44:26,316 --> 02:44:28,783
Thank you for the big donation.

3029
02:44:28,833 --> 02:44:32,500

God is OK

3033
02:44:44,650 --> 02:44:47,766
to put on the mind brake tag already.

3034
02:44:47,766 --> 02:44:50,683
I think it's I think it's like Warren
said, right Allin.

What's it?

3055
02:45:42,183 --> 02:45:45,433
I remembered trying to do the laugh
in the middle and not being sure.

3056
02:45:45,433 --> 02:45:48,733
Like if that was a good idea, like be

3057
02:45:48,733 --> 02:45:50,950
as like a little adlib.

3058
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:51,783

02:45:51,783 --> 02:45:54,216

but it's about you guys still in the game.

3076
02:46:33,666 --> 02:46:34,683

high school musical or anything.

it because my stomach is telling me shop.

3184
02:50:24,183 --> 02:50:27,583
but I'm to leave off
with one final message.

3185
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:32,133
I hope everyone here has a good night

3186
02:50:32,133 --> 02:50:36,216
and I hope that everyone enjoyed my songs

3187
02:50:36,216 --> 02:50:40,116
and what I was able to do
with all of you tonight.

3188
02:50:40,716 --> 02:50:43,983
I mean, I see
that this has been an amazing experience

3189
02:50:43,983 --> 02:50:47,800
and I hope to continue having this feeling

3190
02:50:49,466 --> 02:50:49,816
I have.

3191
02:50:49,816 --> 02:50:54,550
It never ends and grasp
it firmly until the ends of the earth

3192
02:50:54,816 --> 02:50:59,866
because I wants to keep this journey
going and

3193
02:51:01,483 --> 02:51:04,050
hope that all of you will continue

3194
02:51:04,066 --> 02:51:08,266
to be by my side
for as long as you can on this journey.

3195
02:51:08,433 --> 02:51:09,166
