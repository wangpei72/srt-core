1
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,500
OK.

2
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,333


3
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,450
Hi, guys. Good morning.

4
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,066
Good evening, everybody.

5
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,100
How's it going?

6
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,600
What's up? What's up?

7
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,050
Y'all doing good?

8
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,516
Everyone. Everyone. Chilling.

9
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,583
Everyone

10
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:51,416
have dinner.

11
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,533
You better have had dinner.

12
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,716
I saw so many people last night.
They're complaining about they.

13
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,200
Didn't have dinner, so.

14
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,333
I feel, like, inclined to ask and make
sure, like, y'all eat before you stream.

15
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:00,783
I know.

16
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:01,383
I did.

17
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:02,950
OK, so that's another thing.

18
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,716
Like, I've been in such a good habit
lately of making sure

19
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:09,866
I have a meal
before any of my streams and.

20
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:10,650
I don't know.

21
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,050
It seems like something small,
but I'm really proud of myself

22
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,500
because I don't really usually,
I don't know, have good habits I guess.

23
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,400
So it makes me happy that I'm able
to, like, keep up that routine.

24
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,333
Oh, yeah.

25
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:30,816
So I wanted to talk about something
real quick, but hold on

26
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:32,916
Oh, yeah.

27
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,916
There are some, I guess. Guess
chicken nuggets.

28
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,966
Thank you for the 521.

29
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,333
And and I thinking
of the 5000 and midnight.

30
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,566
Thank you for the sincere ones.

31
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,116
Good morning, guys.

32
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,283
Hope you are having a great day.

33
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,066
Lately, I've been in, like,

34
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,883
this weird mood to play Pokemon,
and I don't know why.

35
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,850
Like, there's just something in my head
that's, like, telling me,

36
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,166
oh, you should do a nose lock again.
Shuffle.

37
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,666
And, like, I don't even know, like,
what game I would nose lock in.

38
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,750
Like, I don't know.

39
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,916
Maybe something about pokemon
pokemon heart, golden souls, or like,

40
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,866
pokemon emeralds, or maybe even

41
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,366
Pokemon Platinum, but I'm not sure.

42
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,900
I don't know. It's.

43
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like nothing.
I don't think I would stream.

44
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:20,866
It's more like something I would do
on my own time just to chill and relax.

45
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,616
But yeah, I haven't played a good.

46
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:26,216
Pokemon game in a while, and I don't know,
I haven't finished Legends of Arceus

47
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:31,566
as just like I barely had the time to like
or like my vision, so I want to hop on.

48
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,466
That. Oh, yeah.

49
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,383
So I wanted to talk about this
really quickly

50
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:41,016
while, you know, people are coming in.

51
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,066
But I realised.

52
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:50,800
That I don't know, like after what, a year
plus a shooting,

53
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,016
all it took was like somebody

54
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,616
to email to let me know like, hey,

55
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:03,333
so people can't donate because some people
don't have people, right?

56
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,566
And that makes sense.

57
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:08,516
So what I ended up doing was checking.

58
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,200
I was like, Oh wait.

59
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,650
I can set up my accounts to take
like donations from like cards and stuff.

60
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,650
And I never knew that.

61
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,633
So on Twitter, Tilda.

62
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,516
Oh, thank you so much, dude.

63
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,633
Yeah, we have friends again.

64
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,250
Sort of like, was it a few days ago?

65
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,616
So it makes me really happy.
And we're getting.

66
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,416
Close to half a million, too. Oh, my gosh.
I don't even know.

67
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,783
I would do a half a million.

68
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,700
I know that for YouTube.

69
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,633
I said that on YouTube, if we have 400,
then I'll do a getting over extreme.

70
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,666
But ah, I don't know.

71
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,666
It doesn't seem as painful

72
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,950
as like Jump King or some others, but
a I don't know

73
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,866
like a lot of people struggle
with getting over it.

74
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,033
But I don't know.

75
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:45,450
I have a.

76
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,783
Feeling that after watching
so many streams of getting over it,

77
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll be able to like take those techniques
that people learnt

78
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,833
and just like use on my own to try and,
you know,

79
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,933
make it to the top
because you know, that game is hard.

80
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,600
It's pretty damn hard
for people that you know,

81
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,216
just starting off.

82
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,316
It's like a whole trial and error
process, so.

83
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,550
But right back.

84
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,066
That's what I was talking about.

85
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:13,566
So I realised like it was really hard
for people to like,

86
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,566
you know, support the stream
if they wanted to, um, directly

87
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,333
through the channels and stuff like that.

88
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:22,650
So what I ended up doing
was that if you do want to donate,

89
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,283
you can do that now through a through card

90
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,716
instead of like
doing it to through PayPal.

91
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,166
So you have like two options
through PayPal or through

92
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,150
your own card.

93
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,150
So it's just I was.

94
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,050
I was dumb, I was stupid.

95
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,350
I didn't realise like that was an option
this entire time.

96
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,000
So it's there now, it's because it's
also less inconvenient for other people.

97
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,333
So I'm so sorry about that.

98
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,983
I didn't know like I could set that up
this entire time and, and here like.

99
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,233
You know, some people.

100
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,466
Don't use PayPal, so that's another thing.

101
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,166
But yeah, this. Is an option now.

102
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,983
And if you want so like not lose money
to, to watch and all that stuff.

103
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,983
But yeah, my apologies.

104
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,766
I don't know. I'm a dumb boy.
I'm one big dumb boy.

105
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,150
I didn't, I didn't realise like
I could have that as a donation option.

106
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,916
So yeah, it's there now.

107
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,366
So I hope it works and I hope it's OK.

108
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,116
I don't know if there's any issues I don't
think there's going to be any issue.

109
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,216
So it should be able to work.

110
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,683
And if it doesn't, then let me know. OK?

111
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,066
Sorry. Zoe.

112
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,883
Yeah, because

113
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,266
it was really.

114
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,650
Like I said before, it was
really inconvenient for some people.

115
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,016
So, you know, wants to help
and support their dreams and whatever.

116
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:46,266
So yeah, it's, it's there now,
so it should be a lot easier to do so

117
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:47,916
for everybody.

118
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,766
That's you know,

119
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:54,100
that doesn't have people and like,
you know, doesn't use people.

120
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,516
So those are set up.

121
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,800
But I'm some like I'm stupid, so.

122
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,750
Yeah.

123
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,900
OK, but

124
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,516
ah, today
we're gonna be playing some forever.

125
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:13,266
I've never touch this website
or game before.

126
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,150
It has been like, I've seen it

127
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:18,933
so many times on like switch and

128
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,216
the my recommended.

129
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,066
Because people.

130
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,483
Do like, I think this

131
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:28,233
I tried it and look I've tried it
and like of other few like big streamers,

132
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,283
it's like a crane game stuff, right?

133
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,300
It'll satisfy my needs to do crane games
without actually

134
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
having to go out to an arcade and play it.

135
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,866
So like if,

136
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,600
if I want to go to like round one or like
some other arcade, there's a Korean game.

137
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,633
I don't need to do that.
I could just do it at home.

138
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:48,000
But I heard that it's hard.

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,133
It's like really hard to get a good price.

140
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,300
But you. Know what? That's why.

141
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:58,000
That's why we have,
we have the power of of money.

142
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,850
Question mark, I think.

143
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,283
And I don't know.

144
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,650
Maybe I've seen videos of it, but.

145
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:10,300
There's like a people that work there,
I can help you out, too.

146
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,816
I think that's pretty cool.

147
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,800
Like, you know, if they see
you struggling, they'll be like, hey,

148
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,900
you need some help here.

149
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,050
And they just, like,
grab it and like loosen it up for you.

150
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,900
I think that's really sweet,
but I don't know if I'll get that lucky.

151
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,750
Okay, we're going to try and try
and we'll see what happens.

152
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:28,683
Oh, it's it's really it's.

153
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,350
Really cool.

154
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,516
Like, I've never tried this before,
but I've always wanted to get, like,

155
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:36,550
something from one of these I don't know

156
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,266
if I want to do a figurine or a plushy or,
like, there's, like, other stuff, too.

157
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,166
There's a heater here. What's.

158
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:43,533
I see a.

159
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,116
Lot of cushions and pillows and toys.

160
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,016
But I don't know, there's even all this.

161
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,850
This is a Siberian husky.

162
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,550
Big, plush, and super adorable,
and I think I should switch

163
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,550
over to the to the game or to the site.

164
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,100
And then you guys can see.

165
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,500
On this great beat you.

166
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,466
Congrats on 400. Okay. Less than three.

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,916
Credit card is great.

168
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:06,650
Oh, wait.

169
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, I said that you are okay.

170
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,300
It works, Pug.

171
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,416
All right. Awesome.

00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:13,233
Earned CP yeah, I guess.

268
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,900

the currency that, uh,

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,416
you know, people will use or like,
they use for the young for the game.

I know it's loud.

296
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,150
I didn't know how long it was going to be
so I put it down a bit.

297
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's look at him.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,866

Is it possible, d is this possible

00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,250
I've played tickets, right?

314
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,383
I guess

315
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,266
I ah. I

00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,166

00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,033
Isn't DMCA, is it?

318
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,450
It seems fine.

319
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:32,200
OK. Oh, I'm timed.

320
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,900
Wait, there's a timer.

321
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,883
Why do I have a timer for ah.

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300

325
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,433

Oh, there it is. OK,

00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,150
there you go.

330
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,316
I think you should be able to see it now.

331
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,450
Yeah, there it is. Powers.

332
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,766
OK, wait.

333
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,116

335
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,650

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,166
What is. That? What is that?

338
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,300
It didn't even move at all.

339
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,766
Oh, no. Oh, no.

340
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,233

ok. Ah. Ah.

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,466
If someone give me advice,
should I push it forward?

343
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe I should push it.

344
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,616
With the claw

345
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:53,950
it's a scam.

346
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,466
I share the scam.

347
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,300
I can move it to the left or to the right.

348
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,500
Oh, I think I know why I got you.
I got to like.

349
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000

my way over to the hole, right?

350
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:08,100
So then it can get inside my hole on
or the whole the whole, not my whole.

351
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,766
What's emotion no damage.

352
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,983
OK, cool.

353
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,366
Like that.

354
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,916
And then.

355
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,966
Like that.

356
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:23,516
I know yeah, yeah. Push.

357
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:28,100
Push it, push it. No.

358
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:36,716
What am I.

359
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,183
That's so hard.

360
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,350
Oh, my God.

361
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,550
I don't know what to do.

362
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,150
The bite.

363
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,266
Oh, yeah. I should go for the the. Buy it.

364
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:48,116
Push the head.

365
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,583
I can't push the head. Like
it doesn't want me.

366
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:53,433
It doesn't
let me go further like it won't let me.

367
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,083
I'm trying.

368
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,766
So, like, I thought I could, like,
pick it up in the middle, but it the.

369
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,116
Claws weak as fuck.

370
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:02,666
Aim for the head.

371
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,600
I can't answer that.

372
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,666
It only lets me go like, halfway.

373
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,866
It doesn't like
let me go push to the back.

374
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,000
Aim for the tail.

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,550
And for the tail. Oh.

376
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,333
But no, that doesn't.

377
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,650
Make sense, does it? Hold on, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

378
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,100
You might be onto something

379
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:27,783
I don't know.

380
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,400
I could.

381
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,066
OK, ok. OK, ok, ok. OK,
let's look at this.

382
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,716
Like maybe we should aim for like, back
here.

383
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,966
Like we could get it
stuck on the legs or something.

384
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,816
Why are you so fat?

385
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,033
Do realise the dog goes so fat?

386
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,066
I thought I can't.

387
00:23:59,066 --> 00:23:59,933
I don't know.

388
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,983
Is this possible?

389
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,516
It's too heavy.

390
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:05,650
Yeah, the dog's too heavy, man.

391
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,183
I can't get on

392
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,350
silencing saying
I'm doing something wrong way.

393
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,683
Am I doing something wrong, huh?

394
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,933
Don't grab push I'm.

395
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,000
I don't know how to push or a I like,
move it

396
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,366
to the side of home.

397
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,650
I had to, like,

398
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,833
push it off with the claw thingy

399
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:33,866
perfectly.

400
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,666
One to

401
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,233
help.

402
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,600
It's not too late.

403
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,516
A lower down a bit.

404
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:41,883
So it's not like it's
you blaring in your ears.

405
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:43,733
OK, ok. Yeah, the dog.

406
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,500
OK on a diet after I get them,
this dog is going on a diet

407
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:52,533
it's like, um, maybe.

408
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,850
Maybe if I, if I go.

409
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,233
So far over here
and then like, make it push.

410
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,033
So the

411
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,033
on, I'm going to try something.

412
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:05,316
I don't know. I don't do I don't know this
come on.

413
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,316
Quite like that.

414
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,100
And then

415
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,366
is it like that? Like that. Far?

416
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:15,816
What do you guys think.

417
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:18,900
Push from the head?

418
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,766
I don't know what you mean.

419
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:21,816
Push from the head.

420
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,183
Please.

421
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:35,850
Oh, you're so fat.

422
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,250
It doesn't work.

423
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,616
On raw

424
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:48,800
all it can't even move like the

425
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:51,000
the claw is barely budging. Him

426
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,066
pinch the tail.

427
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,533
I don't think I can pinch the tail.

428
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:59,583
Can I have claws really weak? Ah.

429
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,650
What if you use the claw
to push it to the side.

430
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,083
That's what I was trying to do.

431
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,000
I was trying to use the claw to push it.

432
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,616
So the so the right. Vise not doing that.

433
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:10,983
So it's a scale. What do you.

434
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,483
Mean it's a scale?

435
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,583
I want my dog

436
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:19,716
oh, my God.

437
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,166
Can I get help?
Is there a way for me to get help?

438
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,366
Free gifts.

439
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:24,933
Acquisition judgement requests.

440
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,133
What does that mean?

441
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:31,016
Do you think somebody will help me

442
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,883
pull from the front?

443
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,300
I can't pull from the front.

444
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,666
It doesn't let me pull from the front.

445
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,633
It's impossible. It won't let me.

446
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,516
Yeah, it's like I.

447
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,116
I want to go back further, but

448
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,016
oh, where do I go?

449
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,216
I don't know what to do.

450
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:52,066
I don't know what to do.

451
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:57,716
I maybe.

452
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,766
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let me try something.

453
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:00,666
Let me try something.

454
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:04,833
I could but I don't know.

455
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:05,200
I don't.

456
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,066
Know what I'm trying to do,
but we're trying to do something.

457
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:25,866
Oh, the why?

458
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,716
I thought maybe.

459
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:31,233
Maybe it's, like, I got to, like,
cause like, you know how the centre.

460
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:31,916
Of gravity is?

461
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,083
Like, he's the fattest,
and maybe I should go

462
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,166
for the weakest part of him
and to try and push it there, right?

463
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,450
Or, I don't know, physics.

464
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,766
I was close.

465
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,583
Was it really close? I don't know.

466
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:47,766
Go less forward, OK?

467
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:55,233
OK. Push it when you push this side, OK?

468
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,416
All right,
I'll listen. I'll listen to you.

469
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,916
You seem to be an expert on this, so.

470
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,716
I kind.

471
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,516
Mm hmm.

472
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah.

473
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:08,966
I like that.

474
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,533
It's it's cheesy.

475
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,783
Guys, guys, it's g g. I can't.

476
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,916
I can't do it all. I got it.

477
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,850
I can't do it, man. He's not budging.

478
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,766
His voice are budging.

479
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,466
Oh, is the other claw?

480
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,950
What do you mean, the other claw?

481
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,950
Use the other claw like that one.

482
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,050
Right here on the on the right.

483
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:46,233
Are oh, hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold. On.

484
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:48,033
You might. You might be onto something.

485
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:50,250
You might be onto something.
I didn't try this yet.

486
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:51,533
So put.

487
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,566
Like this.

488
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,483
Your butt is so fucking thick.

489
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:13,716
I don't know what to do, man.

490
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,866
I can't go for the head, guys.
I've tried it.

491
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:18,933
It doesn't want me go further back.

492
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:26,650
Mm this is like a look.

493
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,016
Like more than half of.

494
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,016
His body is stuck on top of the on

495
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,783
top of the platform.

496
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,900
I want him.

497
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,566
As too heavy, man.

498
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:41,766
Yeah, this is. This boy's too heavy.

499
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,466
I think we can

500
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,066
we're.

501
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:49,083
I don't know what to do.

502
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,333
In. Pushing it from the middle.

503
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,050
I don't think pushing.

504
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,333
It from a mill is going to
help. Is really chunky.

505
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,616
Hold on.

506
00:29:58,316 --> 00:29:59,066
I'll do one more.

507
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,300
I'll do one more. OK, just one more.
Just just.

508
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,466
One more.

509
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,200
Just one more.

510
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:26,916
Me. I can't.

511
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:27,933
I can't do it, guys.

512
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,883
It's not it's not working.

513
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,600
It's not working.

514
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,766
Uh, it's stuck.

515
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:42,566
Call for help.

516
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:43,750
How do I call for help?

517
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,416
Help! Help!

518
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,800
Oh, is. This button right here?

519
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,066
Is I press this button

520
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,000
or someone come and help me.

521
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,033
If I press this button,

522
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:57,783
as this.

523
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,583
I'm not sure.

524
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,900
Now. No, I can't call for.

525
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,950
Oh, God, no.

526
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,600
OK. Mm.

527
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:11,950
Oh, I guess I just got.

528
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,400
I just got to do your thing, bro.

529
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:20,516
OK. OK, let's look.

530
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:21,266
Let's look around.

531
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,966
Let's look around. Are

532
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,516
I'm going to try one more time.

533
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:27,033
I'm gonna try.

534
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,316
OK, just one more.

535
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:31,800
Just one more. Just one more.

536
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,500
I want to see if I can you know,

537
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,133
move his butt
a little bit to the to the right

538
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,450
click, ok? OK.

539
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:44,250
OK, ok.

540
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,816
OK. You know, I it's fine.

541
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,916
It's fine. Did

542
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:09,183
it won't let me go to the head?

543
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:10,166
I can't reach the head.

544
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,216
Guys, I don't think you understand.

545
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:14,583
It won't let me go far
back to get to the head

546
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,283
push it down by poking it by.

547
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:21,300
Poking him normal.

548
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,750
Poke him by doesn't let me.

549
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,766
Really push him down that much.

550
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,733
You know I haven't tried that.

551
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:28,300
Have I.

552
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,383
Like like pushing down on the.

553
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:34,116
Mm. I don't know it it's really hard to.

554
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,550
Push down on it though since he's so big

555
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,783
yeah. The dog's too fat.

556
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,350
OK, all right.

557
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,116
We'll come back to this, ok?

558
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:46,416
If anybody look well,
if anybody gets this one gone,

559
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:50,616
I'm going to be sad
if there are people that.

560
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,716
You know, weaken it a bit.

561
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,116
Hey, let me know, all right?

562
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:56,400
If you are. If you are. Ha, ha.

563
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,966
We kinda the thing. Like that more loose

564
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,266
let me know

565
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,866
I was in the middle of this now.

566
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:09,233
I'm not going to continue.

567
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,766
There might be better.

568
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:11,883
There might be better.

569
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:14,100
What's it green games like around I.

570
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:14,650
Always just.

571
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,733
Get rum right

572
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:23,350
about the blue board.

573
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,233
I don't know, like,
I can't do anything about that.

574
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:25,533
It is.

575
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,183
I don't think it lets me
do anything off the blue.

576
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:27,716
Board.

577
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,716
It's impossible.

578
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,866
You mean it's impossible?

579
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,166
Anything is possible
if you put your mind to it, right?

580
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:37,233
I mean, that's what people say.

581
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,850
Which is journey.

582
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,050
Uh, there's a lot of round figurines.

583
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,483
Are there so many rum figurines

584
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:51,516
oh, this is possible.

585
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,066
Is this one possible?

586
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,516
What do you guys think?

587
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,283
Is this one?

588
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:01,750
Oh, we could do this.
We could do this. Yeah.

589
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:04,233
Yeah, it looks. It looks possible.

590
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,000
What do you mean? It's not possible?

591
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,466
You don't think so?

592
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:10,050
You just got to push it, right?

593
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,666
He's got to push it until falls.

594
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,650
I think it doesn't look possible.

595
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, you know what?

596
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,933
We won't know until we try.

597
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,700
Waiting for reservation.

598
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,883
Always somebody else playing already

599
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:29,616
oh, yeah.

600
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:30,433
Somebody is already playing.

601
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:30,783
Sorry.

602
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:37,116
OK, I want to watch his technique,
and we'll see what he does. Bro.

603
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:46,766
Oh, look at that.

604
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:49,650
Look at that.
It just moves, like, ever so slightly.

605
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,966
Is that the goal?
You just got. To, like. Move it a bit.

606
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:57,216
Until he falls down huh?

607
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,800
It's not that easy. Hmm.

608
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,116
Hold on, hold on.

609
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:06,566
There's there's other ones still.

610
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,650
There's, like, there's more I can try.

611
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,066
Like, there's multiple rooms,
and I'm not sure why

612
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:16,466
yeah, there's one right here.

613
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:18,366
What the fuck?

614
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,733
What is this? Is it the same thing?

615
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,200
I think it's the same thing.

616
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,783
What's the ball game?

617
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:27,066
All No, wait.

618
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:30,666
Alan, hold on, hold on, hold on.

619
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,066
Wait. I'm good at these

620
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:37,650
I. Think I can do it.

621
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:37,916
It's.

622
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:40,766
Yeah,
it just has to get into the hole, right?

623
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:42,366
I'm good at putting things in holes.

624
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,500
Watch this.

625
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:53,550
Just gimme, gimme, gimme.

626
00:35:53,616 --> 00:36:07,016
Like three balls. 12.

627
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,433
It's even grab a ball.

628
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,816
It didn't even grab a single ball. Huh?

629
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:15,366
What is. That?

630
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,350
No balls.

631
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,233
Yeah, I got no balls.

632
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,750
Oh, my God. What

633
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,100

634
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,366
Oh. OK.

635
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:31,766
Blue balled.

636
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:32,500
Shut up.

637
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,566
Hey, hey, you shut up! Shut up! No!

638
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:36,783
Oh, boy.

639
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,283
OK. OK.

640
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:43,000
Maybe maybe if I go a little bit more.

641
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,433
On the like.

642
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,600
Could

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,033

644
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:51,933
Please don't cut me.

645
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,250
Please don't kill me.
Grab a ball, grab a ball. Just grab one

646
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,916

647
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,400
In the middle, in the middle.
Right in the middle.

649
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,416
Just drop it right in the middle.

650
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,566
Right in the middle.

651
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:18,066
What is that?

652
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,316
What the fuck is that?

653
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:22,250
It ain't even going to any of the holes.

654
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,200
Think even go to any of the holes.

655
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,516
Bro. Roar.

656
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:29,616
Oh, my God.

657
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:31,383
What is happening?

658
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,133
OK, ok.

659
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, it's good to know that there's
multiple options though.

660
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,400
OK, um.

661
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,750
All of these are rigged.

662
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:42,366
So many of these are rigged down

663
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:44,250
on what?

664
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,166
What what about this one?
What's that? This one?

665
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,250
Same thing.

666
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,483
What is going on here?

667
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,583
What is this?

668
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,466
Why is it just, like, shaking?

669
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh, does he have to push it?

670
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,733
Is he trying to push the

671
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,800
wall? Hold on.

672
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:13,766
Yeah, I had to push it down to looks like.

673
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:16,300
Is this on hard what do you guys think?

674
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,666
Is this one possible?

675
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,233
Should I do this one?

676
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,216
I've never seen.

677
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:24,333
That.

678
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,700
Yeah, I've never this is the first. Time
I've ever seen this one.

679
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:29,433
As long as. Impossible on the whole.

680
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,083
I don't know

681
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:35,733
it's glued it to the

682
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,800
someone said it's glued to the string.

683
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,800
Is it really

684
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,400
all the person that was on this
just gave up?

685
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,883
I think he left

686
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:51,150
all air.

687
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,016
Use my thingy.

688
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:54,300
OK, it's too late.
I guess I got a start, right?

689
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,750
I guess I just got to start.

690
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:04,716
This might be ok.

691
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:05,966
OK, well, we'll see.

692
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:07,716
We'll see about that.

693
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,850
I could.

694
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,483
Oh, fuck me.

695
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,866
I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up.

696
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,216
I fucked up. I fucked up.

697
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:23,850
Or did I. Or did I. What

698
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,933
Excluded.

699
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,566
Excluded. Do you see that?

700
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:33,416
Oh, my God.

701
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,666
There's no way that has to.

702
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,933
Be, like, glued or,
like, taped to the string.

703
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,550
No, no.

704
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,883
Oh, my. God.

705
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,166
OK, this one's a scam.

706
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,633
This one is 100% big, big scam.

707
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,900
No, no, no, I'm not doing that.

708
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,483
Get me out

709
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,216
what about this?

710
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,866
What do I have to do for this one?

711
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,400
Is there, like, is it like picking up?

712
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,366
What?

713
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,216
Yeah. What is this. One?

714
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:14,216
I don't understand, because don't explain

715
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:18,966
show me the card out.

716
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,366
I to show me the card out.

717
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,083
How do you hold on. Let's watch.

718
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,116
Let's watch this person try and do it.

719
00:40:24,116 --> 00:40:27,900
Maybe I'll understand after watching them

720
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,883
what the fuck am I looking at?

721
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:33,216
What's that doesn't look.

722
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:34,016
That doesn't look good.

723
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:42,900
No, no, no, no.

724
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,533
Mm hmm.

725
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:47,733
OK, I'm going to go back
to go back to the regular one.

726
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,216
I see what's happening here.

727
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:51,033
Oh, my God.

728
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,533
The guy gave up. The guy give up.

729
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,200
Oh, my God.

730
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
The guy gave up. OK, ok. It's possible.

731
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,083
I think. I think I can.

732
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:01,116
I can grab it right? I just got it.

733
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:03,300
I just got move it. Slightly
more slightly.

734
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,066
It's going to take a few tries.

735
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,533
I think I could do this one.

736
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:09,016
Right, right.

737
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:09,900
Right.

738
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,633
Yeah.

739
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,200
I think they.

740
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,516
Loosened it up for me to like, hey,

741
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:22,500
OK, let's try.

742
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,150
Yeah, we can try. Yeah.

743
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,700
I'll put

744
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,083
oh, that's a much

745
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,666
they do it right

746
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,150
oh, ok. OK.

747
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,633
Oh, it's looking.

748
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,916
It's looking pretty good.

749
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,516
It's moving.

750
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:52,233
It's moving.

751
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,566
That's progress, right?
There's there's progress. There.

752
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,283
It's moving. Grab the head

753
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:01,416
like back here.

754
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:04,350
Can I even go that far back

755
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,816
OK. All right, we'll try.

756
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,283
We'll try

757
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,633
oh, no, wait.

758
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,650
I might not be far further enough.

759
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,616
Oh, it is.

760
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:27,516
It is.

761
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,450
What?

762
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:36,266
What is it heavier there or something?

763
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:38,283
What am I missing? Something there? What?

764
00:42:38,283 --> 00:42:40,666
It didn't even move like it got budge.

765
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,066
Just slightly.

766
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:43,650
I miss.

767
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,066
What do you mean?

768
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,150
I miss it.

769
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,850
Like it didn't even push it

770
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,033
oh, it's too further.

771
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:56,066
I really miss old. I really miss.

772
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:57,933
I don't. Know. Oops.

773
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,166
It's not glued.

774
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:03,400
I don't think Zone's glued OK.

775
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:06,400
I guess I'll just stick to. My.

776
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:10,866
I'll stick to this side instead.

777
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:14,766
Because on.

778
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:15,716
Balance, it doesn't.

779
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:17,350
Look too.

780
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,600
Whoa, whoa.

781
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,800
That's good.

782
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,516
That's really good.

783
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:27,366
That was really good. OK, ok.

784
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,450
Got a lot of movement.

785
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,366
Off that one. Holy shit.

786
00:43:33,366 --> 00:43:35,166
I think we can do it.

787
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,783
I wish I had my heart.

788
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,400
And literally. Now.

789
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,450
It's like I feel like my heart's like 150.

790
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,033
She's

791
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:50,500
on. I mean, look.

792
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,866
That's a to take a better look at it,
I can't move it from here.

793
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:58,000
I mean, I probably could buy, like,
I failed big time trying to do

794
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,533
that.

795
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,683
Spooky crankiness.

796
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:07,050
So spooky.

797
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,850
All right,

798
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:21,000
OK. All right, all right.

799
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,750
It's it's still good. It's still good.

800
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,400
We're moving it.

801
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,500
We're moving it, man.

802
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:30,450
Right?

803
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,666
Yeah. Grab the middle.

804
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,900
Grab the middle. I don't think.

805
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,050
I think it's too heavy.

806
00:44:40,566 --> 00:44:41,550
Like, if I try to grab the.

807
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,733
Middle, it's not even going to pick it up.

808
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,200
Now, we're really close not them at all.

809
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,816
We can't grab them.

810
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:48,850
Then all we had to go for the
the weak spot.

811
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,816
That's a yeah. Get the get the weak spot.

812
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:53,666
Oh, yeah.

813
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,916
There's people waiting right now.

814
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,116
They want to do like
they're like vultures.

815
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,066
You guys are vultures. All of you.

816
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,416
All five of you are vultures.

817
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,933
I mean, I'm on the same cell

818
00:45:04,716 --> 00:45:08,850
but. Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi. OK,

819
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:11,900
let me see what

820
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,266
maybe they'll push it even more if.

821
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:21,400
I let go a few moments later,

822
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:24,216
it moves a bit more

823
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:30,550
there is a little bit more guys.

824
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,616
A little bit more.

825
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:32,400
Right?

826
00:45:34,683 --> 00:45:37,166
Oh, God, dude, where do I go now?

827
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,200
I want to try for the this.

828
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,000
Part again by I don't know

829
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,066
try the right corner.

830
00:45:53,433 --> 00:45:55,650
I'm going to try to go for the back again,
maybe.

831
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:56,433
Yeah.

832
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:59,166
This seems like seems like a good lesson.

833
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,650
We did it.

834
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,250
Oh wow.

835
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,283
I there might be a weaker.

836
00:46:02,283 --> 00:46:04,050
Now though since I moved this a bit.

837
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,550
OK, ok, let's just try let's just try

838
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:18,100
it. OK?

839
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,033
Potters

840
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,533
joggers.

841
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,516
What.

842
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:31,600
I don't think I don't think
I'm going to get anything by.

843
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,016
Moving it back there.

844
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:35,450
That looks so dumb.

845
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,533
Oh, so dumb.

846
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,000
I can't do that. I got six of.

847
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,233
The the backs, the the bottom part of the

848
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,166
the box right.

849
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,533
It's all for sure.

850
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:48,566
Yeah. I mean, that's. That's Korean games.

851
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:51,866
Oh. Mm.

852
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:56,916
Oh. Ok. OK.

853
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,816
What I do.

854
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,116
What do I do, y'all.

855
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,600
Bro, bro, bro.

856
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,350
What I do what I do what I do what I do

857
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,516
you can get this at the bottom.

858
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,016
Yeah, I think I just say at the bottom.

859
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:15,250
That seems like
the only thing we can do right now.

860
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,600
It's the thing that's working for us right

861
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,033
chi chi.

862
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:22,566
Chi chi.

863
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,816
There's a little too much there.

864
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:25,350
I don't know.

865
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:36,516
Again.

866
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:38,133
And moves just a little bit.

867
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:39,783
It just moves only a little bit.

868
00:47:39,783 --> 00:47:42,300
Ah ha.

869
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,883
Go over the bottom edge.

870
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:47,316
Like the very, very bottom edge.

871
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,816
Glossaryck roll the ones.

872
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:52,650
The ones out.

873
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,950
My arcade aren't nearly this week.

874
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,266
Mm mm.

875
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,950
We're going to the middle. Get me.

876
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:02,516
I don't think it's.

877
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:05,066
Strong enough
to, like, even do anything in the middle

878
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,450
I feel like I'm going to.

879
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,783
You're if you're telling me
if I try to go for the middle

880
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:13,266
really try the middle.

881
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,700
I will keep saying try the middle.

882
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm that scary. That is scary.

883
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,066
OK, I'll trust you.

884
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:22,700
Chi Chi Chi Chi.

885
00:48:35,366 --> 00:48:37,600
What the fuck?

886
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,216
Well, I don't even know what happened.

887
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,666
I don't even know what happened.

888
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:50,850
What was that? Did it was that good guys?

889
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,600
Was that good?

890
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,116
I don't know.

891
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:55,316
Don't those good was that a good thing
or was a bad thing?

892
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,233
It just flipped.
I mean, maybe that's good.

893
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:58,866
All right.

894
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:00,866
Maybe that's good that we flipped it, huh?

895
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,366
I don't know.

896
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:03,766
Yeah, OK.

897
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:06,016
I don't know.

898
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,800
The left claw is strong.

899
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,700
Yeah, it was strong.

900
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,100
Know they had change anything

901
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:23,616
mm OK.

902
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,716
I'm going to try to get the edge again.

903
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,300
Pull on. Try edging it one more time.

904
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,466
I'm really good at edging.

905
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:32,366
You know that

906
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,850
hey, that's pretty good.

907
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,550
That's pretty good. It's getting closer.

908
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,650
It's getting closer and closer.

909
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,266
So it's like, drop me inside.

910
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:49,683
Please, please.

911
00:49:49,683 --> 00:49:52,016
Oh, my God.

912
00:49:55,166 --> 00:50:01,950
I'm sure I try the middle again,
but I don't know.

913
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,650
That seems kind of like it seem. Kind of.

914
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,216
It seems scary
because I feel like it might reset my.

915
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:11,400
Progress if I try and do that.

916
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,466
I'll try the front again.

917
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,850
Try the front again.

918
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,933
I don't think going for
the front is a good idea because the

919
00:50:24,216 --> 00:50:25,566
the right claws weak as fuck.

920
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,850
Maybe like maybe like bottom middle right.

921
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,466
Point.

922
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,750
Like I'm I'm trying to abuse
that the left claws

923
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,883
stronger

924
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,516
like right here.

925
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:43,133
What if we do this

926
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:46,616
I fuck up.

927
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:51,250
Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

928
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,700
I just got. To push it
in. I just got to push it in now, right?

929
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,983
Is that is that how it works?

930
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,116
I think

931
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,216
I think that's good.
I just got to push it.

932
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:03,850
I just got to push it.

933
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,700
Only I just I'll push it.

934
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,816
Or maybe I lift up the back

935
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:12,533
or maybe I lift off the back part like

936
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,016
I think
I think if I try and lift up the back.

937
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:20,816
Part, it will like fall in right.

938
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,316
Per head. Yeah, we go for that.

939
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:22,900
We go for that.

940
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,666
I don't know.

941
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:26,700
Oh, I got all no mods. Can we get a pole.

942
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:29,433
Can we get a pole
as I go for the head or do I go for the.

943
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:30,450
Bottom part like.

944
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,250
So I try and push it
in. Or do I try and lift it up.

945
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,716
I don't know what's a good option.

946
00:51:36,716 --> 00:51:40,833
Here by pushing it
or lifting from the lifting from the head

947
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,616
or pushing the bottom part

948
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:46,916
as I'm sure

949
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,950
those are other people would know.

950
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,150
I don't know

951
00:51:58,466 --> 00:51:59,366
all a lot of OK,

952
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,683
a lot of people are saying
go for the head right now.

953
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,450
A lot of people say go for the head, OK.

954
00:52:04,616 --> 00:52:05,733
Head, head.

955
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:06,866
So no head.

956
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,183
OK. OK, we're going for the head.

957
00:52:12,183 --> 00:52:13,450
We're going for that.

958
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:32,166
Cut one.

959
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,200
Oh, my God.

960
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,350
Oh, you're such a cock teaser.

961
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,600
What the fuck was I? It's

962
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,233
all raw.

963
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:44,516
Oh, my God. My adrenaline.

964
00:52:44,516 --> 00:52:45,966
My adrenaline.

965
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,366
It's so close.

966
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:53,516
Yeah, it is getting super fucking close.

967
00:52:58,016 --> 00:52:58,916
It's right there.

968
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:00,550
It's just sitting there.

969
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,216
It's just sitting there.

970
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,466
Oh, I'll

971
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,166
try again.

972
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,450
Yeah, I'm definitely going for that.

973
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:19,466
I just don't know if I should
go, like, more inner closer to the middle.

974
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,550
Maybe I.

975
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,400
Could. OK.

976
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,266
OK, right there.

977
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,950
Like, maybe right there.

978
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,983
What the heck?

979
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,316
A bra

980
00:53:48,866 --> 00:53:50,866
lights.

981
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,250
It didn't. Move.

982
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,200
It did move at all.

983
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:01,216
So just try the bottom.

984
00:54:02,516 --> 00:54:03,483
Oh, my God. I don't know.

985
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,850
I just try the bottom at this point.

986
00:54:08,816 --> 00:54:10,533
Do the people watching must be like, no.

987
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:11,850
Do this, do that.

988
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,600
But I follow.

989
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:15,850
Guys like, I'm fucking up.

990
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,200
OK, I'll do the bottom. Just once.

991
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,083
I'm like, I tried just once.

992
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,216
Just once

993
00:54:21,116 --> 00:54:24,400
and see what happens. Come

994
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:37,616
I didn't push it.

995
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:38,216
I didn't push it.

996
00:54:38,216 --> 00:54:38,666
OK, ok.

997
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,250
That's my bad.

998
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,166
That's my bad. I, I fucked up.

999
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:43,266
I think I got to be a little.

1000
00:54:43,266 --> 00:54:46,000
Bit more further to the to the right.

1001
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,250
So too far. No, not too far.

1002
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:49,716
Not far. Enough. I think

1003
00:54:53,766 --> 00:54:55,416
ok. OK, let's. Try.

1004
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,300
Chi chi.

1005
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,916
Chi chi chi.

1006
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,100
Like that far.

1007
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,383
So then the left clock in like,
push it and maybe

1008
00:55:08,283 --> 00:55:08,500
right.

1009
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,083
You see what I'm getting out?
You see what I'm going?

1010
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,250
It doesn't work.

1011
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,466
It doesn't work.

1012
00:55:13,616 --> 00:55:16,500
It doesn't work, guys.

1013
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:19,600
Oh, no,

1014
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,683
I'm stumped, man.

1015
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:27,066
It's not strong enough to push it in.

1016
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,500
I just got to stick to the hard gas.

1017
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,850
Stick to the top.

1018
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,116
Yeah. Mm.

1019
00:55:39,066 --> 00:55:42,183
Try lifting the left corner.

1020
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:48,466
Uh, uh, uh,

1021
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,150
uh. Hold on.

1022
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,816
Let me try

1023
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,966
let me see

1024
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,650
it's hot.

1025
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:16,466
For what the fuck.

1026
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,900
Did I just, like, get?

1027
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,033
I'm just like, fuck myself.

1028
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,366
I don't know what happened there.

1029
00:56:23,366 --> 00:56:26,316
Li. I don't know what happened there.

1030
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,716
I ruined it.

1031
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:28,616
I don't think I ruined it.

1032
00:56:28,616 --> 00:56:31,833
Did I it went back. Should out.

1033
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,033
I don't know how

1034
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:38,216
I fucked solve.

1035
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:42,333
I know I'm fucked up how, how how I fuck

1036
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,350

1037
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,566
Me motion no.

1038
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:51,450
Damn it, it might be good
it might be good.

1039
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,100
How how that might be good.

1040
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,383
Oh, maybe it is good.

1041
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:57,866
Oh, maybe you're right.
Maybe you have a point there.

1042
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:59,366
Maybe you have a point

1043
00:57:01,816 --> 00:57:02,666
I can push.

1044
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:05,316
Yeah, push the bottom again.

1045
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,583
Maybe it's.

1046
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,683
Maybe I saved it.

1047
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,800
Yeah, maybe I saved it.

1048
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:18,266
I could.

1049
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:26,433
Ooh. It's for

1050
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:33,966

1051
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:36,816
Boy. Oh, bra roll around.

1052
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:39,700
Oh, I fucked it up again.

1053
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,750
It's so I keep I keep messing it up.

1054
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:46,650
Oh, now it's back, baby.

1055
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,733
Oh, my God.

1056
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:51,266
It's back to how it was before

1057
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,216
on Niall.

1058
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:56,766
Yeah, this O'Neil moment.

1059
00:57:57,783 --> 00:57:59,516
O'Neil moment.

1060
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:02,850
Let me try and.

1061
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,983
Cut. Look, I'm. Bring it back.

1062
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,566
Bring back again.

1063
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:26,500
All will happen, will happen.

1064
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:28,750
However, it's over.

1065
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,450
What do you mean it's over?

1066
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,916
It's not over.

1067
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:34,016
It's not over.

1068
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:36,800
All don't play.

1069
00:58:36,816 --> 00:58:37,533
I'm too far.

1070
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:41,433
Guys, guys,
I'm too far into this to stop now.

1071
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,616
There's five people waiting
because they know they can get it.

1072
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,000
I can't just give up right now.

1073
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,733
If I give up right now, then.

1074
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,433
Then I'm it's g g i i

1076
00:58:55,466 --> 00:58:58,116
If I try and push the life again.

1077
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:07,800
Suck suck

1078
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:08,766
your dick

1079
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:13,116
please.

1080
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,833
It's not budging
all it doesn't budge anymore

1081
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:21,366
because it's like it's too
it's still stuck off the pole.

1082
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:24,933
I can't do that anymore, guys.

1083
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,716
People keep saying, trying.

1084
00:59:28,716 --> 00:59:30,450
To go for the middle

1085
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:32,816
and think
going for the middle is good, isn't

1086
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,250
going for the middle?

1087
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,066
Are you sure? Pride?

1088
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,616
Are you sure? Huh?

1089
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:45,000
You're a liar.

1090
01:00:00,616 --> 01:00:02,333
It froze

1091
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,166
all. What?

1092
01:00:05,816 --> 01:00:07,316
That was weird.

1093
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,316
That was weird.

1094
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,216
I thought it broke. For a second.

1095
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,916
Yeah. Huh?

1096
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,466
What happened?

1097
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:21,516
Oh, come on, Ma, can you come help me?

1098
01:00:21,516 --> 01:00:23,550
God, God, are you there?

1099
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,900
Please, please come help help me.

1100
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,800
I don't know what to do.

1101
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:40,466
I'm like, the only.

1102
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:41,616
Thing I can see trying to do

1103
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:45,216
is just getting the TV on the middle
is not gonna help anything, bro.

1104
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:47,166
Uh, baa, baa.

1105
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:51,183
Baa, baa. Cut.

1106
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,650
All of that stuff.

1107
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,266
Far, far enough.

1108
01:00:58,016 --> 01:00:58,866
Oh, god.

1109
01:00:58,866 --> 01:00:59,283
Please.

1110
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:01,150
Oh, God, please.

1111
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:09,033
Wow. Oh, my God.

1112
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,833
Oh, my God.

1113
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,316
Oh, God.

1114
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,516
It did something.

1115
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,216
It did something that was pretty good.

1116
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:19,716
It was pretty good.
It was pretty good. Guys,

1117
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:24,366
there's there's so much happening

1118
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:27,266
there's so much happening of this
fucking box, man.

1119
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,250
Now I can grab the bottom.

1120
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,950
I can grab the bottom now, right?

1121
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,250
Oh, oh, oh.

1122
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,316
What the fuck is this?

1123
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:43,650
How's it look on the side.

1124
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:46,650
We've made

1125
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:50,433
a lot of progress with this stupid box,
though.

1126
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,783
Put OK.

1127
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,250
I think that's enough.

1128
01:01:59,250 --> 01:01:59,700
We'll see.

1129
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,716
We'll see.

1130
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:06,700
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1131
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:08,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's massive.

1132
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,350
That is massive.

1133
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,700
Cock in my arse.

1134
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,400
Dude, what's like.

1135
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,683
This is this is really. Looking good.

1136
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:17,616
It's looking great.

1137
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:19,716
Is looking amazing right now.

1138
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,850
De la la.

1139
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,150
I think we can get it.

1140
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm pretty sure we can get it right.

1141
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,416
It's you're all all I got.

1142
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,950
I don't have to
scream for it's only 4 hours.

1143
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:38,350
Before it's time for our.

1144
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:42,450
Crew. Cut

1145
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,200
OK. I think that's it.

1146
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:49,716
I think.

1147
01:02:49,716 --> 01:02:50,200
I think.

1148
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,516
I think. Wow.

1149
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,633
Hey, why does he keep teasing.

1150
01:02:57,633 --> 01:02:58,233
Me like this?

1151
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,200
Well.

1152
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,233
Oh, my God.

1153
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:05,733
We're so close. We're so fucking close.

1154
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:07,750
We're so close. Dude, look at it.

1155
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,883
Look at it.

1156
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,816
Why this looks so dumb, by the way.

1157
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:17,950
Yeah, just.

1158
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:18,216
Oh, just.

1159
01:03:18,216 --> 01:03:20,066
One more thing. Just one more.

1160
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:22,716
How have we do prediction for that?

1161
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:28,200
Oh, we know there's already production
going on man.

1162
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:38,366
OK, is that enough?

1163
01:03:42,366 --> 01:03:42,933
Oh, my God.

1164
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:44,016
Just moved.

1165
01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:46,450
It moved like a tiny chub.

1166
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,033
So I.

1167
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,900
Swear, it's the inside.

1168
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:53,800
It's all just one.

1169
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,100
More.

1170
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,583
It's going to be like five more.

1171
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,866
Something

1172
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,766
it's so close.

1173
01:04:01,766 --> 01:04:02,766
Oh, my God, bro.

1174
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:04,266
It's so, so fucking close.

1175
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,816
I don't want to fuck up and, like,
bring it back to, like.

1176
01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:14,733
A position where it's impossible,
you know,

1177
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:17,016
like, this is I are

1178
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:20,766
I'm going to choke.

1179
01:04:20,766 --> 01:04:22,266
I don't want to shock.

1180
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,666
Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi.

1181
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:30,933
All right, all right, all right.

1182
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:36,566
Please, please.

1183
01:04:36,566 --> 01:04:37,900
Please, please.

1184
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,600
Oh, my God. Just go inside.

1185
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:44,083
Just go inside.

1186
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:46,566
Please, please.

1187
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:47,066
Oh, my God.

1188
01:04:47,066 --> 01:04:48,933
Just go inside.

1189
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,000
Why is it not going in?

1190
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,150
Oh, my God. What is in?

1191
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,950
It's not going in.

1192
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,533
Maybe it's more.

1193
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,500
I can't believe I spent, like, almost.

1194
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,333
This is, like, pretty much almost 100,
but I don't know how much

1195
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:10,933
this thing is actually worth.

1196
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,416
We're so close.

1197
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:14,666
Yeah, it's almost there.

1198
01:05:15,966 --> 01:05:18,216
Answer. It's almost there.

1199
01:05:18,216 --> 01:05:21,516
I could.

1200
01:05:22,183 --> 01:05:23,850
You. Know,
we just got to keep them nudging

1201
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:26,366
bit by bit.

1202
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:29,350
Also too far.

1203
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,216
What is that?

1204
01:05:43,383 --> 01:05:45,516
Emotional damage?

1205
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:47,433
What is that?

1206
01:05:49,716 --> 01:05:51,100
Is. So it goes.

1207
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,200
Oh, my God.

1208
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:52,650
Measure.

1209
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:55,283
Push it from this side. Know

1210
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:57,850
move the other side.

1211
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,583
Yeah, yeah. I think that's that's
that's a good that's good call.

1212
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,250
That's a really good call.

1213
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:09,116
Only on.

1214
01:06:09,116 --> 01:06:10,900
OK, ok. OK,

1215
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:22,616
hop OK.

1216
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,500
What's

1217
01:06:27,966 --> 01:06:29,850
all I'm going to go crazy.

1218
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,900
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

1219
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,366
What is what do I do now?

1220
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:37,833
What do I do now?

1221
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:38,800
Just push it, make.

1222
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,766
It, push it in

1223
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,283
shove it, just shove it.

1224
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:47,883
So just

1225
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:51,566
f really

1226
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:53,100
grab it from the middle or shove it.

1227
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,050
I don't know what to do, bro.

1228
01:06:59,366 --> 01:07:07,233
Oh. Oh. Now

1229
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,433
OK. All right. I'm

1230
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:17,616
just grab it from the middle.

1231
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,866
I feel like I'm
going to lose all my progress

1232
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:21,483
if I do this, but we'll see.

1233
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,133
I want to fuck around, find out

1234
01:07:25,316 --> 01:07:25,916
I want to see.

1235
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,933
I want to fuck around and find out
and see what happens.

1236
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,266
Let's just see what happens.

1237
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:40,516
It kind of almost worked

1238
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,966
oh, boy.

1239
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:47,616
Push the corners. Really.

1240
01:07:47,616 --> 01:07:48,716
So just push the corners.

1241
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,750
You know,
you might have a point there, OK? Good.

1242
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,566
A good idea.

1243
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:52,450
Really good idea.

1244
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,550
Just push the corners right

1245
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:13,650
oh, ah. Oh,

1246
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,016
what do I do?

1247
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:21,850
Someone save me.

1248
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,000
A soul and save me hell.

1249
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,983
That's all in hell

1250
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,716
I'm I'm I'm stuck.

1251
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:38,266
Get a bit closer now.

1252
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:43,616
You. This is, this is so this is painful.

1253
01:08:45,866 --> 01:08:47,733
This is so painful.

1254
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:52,200
I don't know where to go yards here.

1255
01:08:52,200 --> 01:09:00,833
I don't know which way to go from mm.

1256
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,666
Look at the front corner
and try to hit the claw

1257
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,833
where the bar is to push it
in the front corner

1258
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:10,900
and try to hit the claw
where the bar is to push it in.

1259
01:09:11,516 --> 01:09:12,033
Hold on.

1260
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,500
That that corner

1261
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:20,300
OK. Put.

1262
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:24,266
I'll trust you

1263
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,450
what I did so far

1264
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:29,883
is that too far?

1265
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,116
I think that was too far.

1266
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:34,800
Oh, my God.

1267
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,550
I look like a stupid idiot.

1268
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,850
I look so stupid

1269
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,100
so far up there's input lag.

1270
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,566
There's some there's some input lag.

1271
01:09:45,566 --> 01:09:49,300
Guys, it's hard. I.

1272
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:52,616
Mean, this is pain.

1273
01:09:52,616 --> 01:09:55,800
People in pickle always

1274
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:59,800
OK, well, that is hard enough.

1275
01:10:01,566 --> 01:10:03,750
No, it doesn't do. Oh.

1276
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:10,150
What is this?

1277
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,283
What does this?

1278
01:10:11,283 --> 01:10:12,966
Is this time?

1279
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,066
What's

1280
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,016
I don't.

1281
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,066
Please wait without quitting

1282
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,366
someone coming to help?

1283
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:24,783
Someone come to help.

1284
01:10:24,783 --> 01:10:26,883
Oh, my God. Am I. Is God coming?

1285
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,916
Oh, is God going to help me?

1286
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:29,133
Wait.

1287
01:10:29,133 --> 01:10:30,816
What? Huh?

1288
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,950
What the fuck happened? God.

1289
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,516
God, what did you do?

1290
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:39,550
Do I just put away?

1291
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,666
Don't just push it.
Oh, my God. Do I just push it?

1292
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:47,050
I just.

1293
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,333
I just push it in.

1294
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,000
This is all I.

1295
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,500
Have to do.

1296
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,783
I'll think.

1297
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,750
I think I just push it in
or that I lift it up from the back

1298
01:11:00,866 --> 01:11:02,850
of the head again.

1299
01:11:03,866 --> 01:11:05,050
I can't believe.

1300
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,450
I suck so bad
that they had to help me too.

1301
01:11:07,466 --> 01:11:09,216
OK, thank you.

1302
01:11:09,216 --> 01:11:09,933
Whoever you are.

1303
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:14,200
Thank you. Oh.

1304
01:11:17,016 --> 01:11:20,133
How do I go for the back?

1305
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:21,550
Like, you know, back here?

1306
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:22,866
Do I lift up from the from.

1307
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,916
The from where the the green stuff is or
do I just push it

1308
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:29,100
from from the air, from the top head

1309
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,783
of there, from the back.

1310
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:36,516
Not do it.

1311
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,433
Maybe. Maybe we can.

1312
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:40,416
Yeah. Let's try the back

1313
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,233
we can.

1314
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:46,016
Even golf that far back. Is my question.

1315
01:11:46,616 --> 01:11:47,566
Oh. I

01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,316

1317
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:54,033
I don't want to fuck it up.
I don't want to fuck up.

1318
01:11:54,033 --> 01:11:55,450
The only chance I think.

1319
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,550
They're going to give me right

1320
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:02,316

Oh, shit.

I felt so good.

01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,250
Like God down, man.

1334
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,166
Now it's ideal.

1335
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:57,216

I don't know what happens now.

01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,850
Exit out of it.

OK, I got it now. All right.

Congratulations.

1349
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:46,233
You want to re zero something?

Thank you, god for thank you, god
for coming and saving my vote.

1358
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,616
When all seem that
when everything seems like you know

1359
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,583
it's at a loss, I can
I can always rely on on the

1360
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:19,500
the man behind the camera who's watching

1361
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:21,850
and wishing for my success I guess

1362
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,766
what if they're watching the stream
right now?

1363
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,866
Nah, there's no way.

1364
01:14:28,866 --> 01:14:32,583
There's no way. OK.

1365
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,866
Well, I mean, we got one.

1366
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:36,516
We got one

1367
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:41,050

1368
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:42,400
Yeah. Let me check on the dagger.

1369
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,016
Let's see how what he's up to.

1370
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,466
Hot. As this time.

01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,200
Huh? What? No.

Get me in. There. Get me in there.

1374
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,550
Oh, no. How did they do this?

1375
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,800
How did these. People do this?

1376
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,600
Oh, what now?

1377
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,150
No, I'm too late. It's gone.

1378
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,183
I'm too late.

1379
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,733
So I'm just going to get it.

1380
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:12,633
Already is, guys.

1381
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:17,483
Because I saw Asa wait in line.

1382
01:15:17,483 --> 01:15:18,633
How did they do that?

1383
01:15:18,633 --> 01:15:20,066
All lost somewhere here.

1384
01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:24,300
The dog was, like,
all the way pushed in why.

1385
01:15:30,183 --> 01:15:30,866
Oh, no.

Oh, no.

01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:33,483
Oh, God.

Actually hold.

I mean, I can't see.

1396
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,650
Anything right now.

1397
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:57,216
I just have to sit here and wait

1398
01:15:57,216 --> 01:16:00,183
because there's other people playing
right now until right

1399
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:05,050

1400
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:07,500
I can't see anything.

1401
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,400
I don't know. Maybe.

1402
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,716
Maybe I can just like snake it out
and chill here.

1403
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:14,966
And so, like, they get bored and go.

1404
01:16:14,966 --> 01:16:17,350
Maybe there's a chance.

1405
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,483
There's there's always a chance.

1406
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:19,083
Sorry.

OK. Yeah.

What is he doing right now?
Come on, come on.

Hurry up.

1413
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:52,016
You know, there's five.

1414
01:16:52,016 --> 01:16:53,200
People waiting right now.

1415
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,383
I am probably number five,
so I don't think.

1416
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:59,483
God, I don't think I can do anything
right now.

1417
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:10,950
Until they're off,
until they're done. Try.

What do you guys think? Bigger.

01:17:36,516 --> 01:17:37,116
Better.

1425
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:38,666
Too much bigger is better.

1426
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,650
OK, cool.

1427
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:43,283
Yeah.

1428
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:46,450
Now you can see the whole thing, right?

1429
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:49,866
It's a bit easier to see.

1430
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:50,466
Yeah.

1431
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,616
So, um, I don't know what's going on
with this guy.

1432
01:17:54,816 --> 01:17:58,650
He's just kind of he's
just kind of chillin.

1433
01:18:05,283 --> 01:18:06,300
I love how the dog it.

Looks like

1435
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:14,816
Oh, thank you for the.

1436
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:15,633
High train, by the way.

1437
01:18:15,633 --> 01:18:15,933
Hold on.

1438
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:17,400
I didn't really notice
that. There a string.

1439
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,916
Thank you so much. My

1440
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:31,150
I feel like what if what if the person
what if the person here

1441
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:34,416
is like a viewer and they're just like,
they're teasing me, right?

1442
01:18:34,766 --> 01:18:35,583
You're cruel.

1443
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,150
You're cruel. Then if.

1444
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,950
Somebody is watching me right now.

1445
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,850
And they're just,
like, taunting me of the dog and you suck,

1446
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:49,416
suck I don't think.

1447
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:51,716
I don't think anyone's doing that, though.
I doubt it.

1448
01:18:51,716 --> 01:18:55,866
Oh, OK. Oh.

1449
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,233
Well, in a second, what is happens my

1450
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,416
I think I got karma.

1451
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:06,450
I think I just got karma
for spitting on you guys.

1452
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:09,000
OK, now remind her back.

1453
01:19:09,066 --> 01:19:15,350
No, oh, oh.

1454
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:18,000
I wanted it.

1455
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:21,333
God damn it. Roll

1456
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,116
bye, dog.

1457
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:30,000
Oh, the dog is gone now.

1458
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,500
They got the dog.

1459
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,266
I wanted the dog.

1460
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:34,916
All this.

1461
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:35,133
I know.

1462
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:36,750
It's possible

1463
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:42,600
it's OK.

1464
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,850
I got. I got. I got them.

1465
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:45,233
I want the.

1466
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:48,416
Dog. The dog, though.

1467
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:48,866
Yeah.

1468
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:51,000
I think I'm going to try
and try for the dog.

1469
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,866
I really want him.

1470
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:53,533
He's so cute, man.

1471
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:55,733
This little big, fluffy fucker.

1472
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,150
You're expecting me not to try for him.

1473
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:58,733
I think they're.

1474
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:00,983
Going to refill
it soon with another dog. So

1475
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:05,700
let's just wait.

1476
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,683
That's the way a bit and see a farm.

1477
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,416
They refill it.

1478
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,400
Please give me.

1479
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,433
I just want a dog.

1480
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:13,533
I just want a dog.

1481
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:19,766
Gimme, gimme, gimme

1482
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:20,850

1483
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,733
Oh, oh. Oh,

1484
01:20:26,366 --> 01:20:27,966
oh, I'm here.

1485
01:20:27,966 --> 01:20:29,766
OK, ok.

1486
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:37,000
I mean, now I

1487
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,233
what,

1488
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:40,316
are they going to put.

1489
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:42,516
Another dog in a dog?

1490
01:20:42,516 --> 01:20:44,700
Dog? All local, please.

1491
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,316
Please.

1492
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,000
Just start.

1493
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,050
I don't know where to start.

1494
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:55,983
I can't start until, like, there's a
you know, there's something that's ill.

1495
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:57,516
There's no dog.

1496
01:20:57,516 --> 01:21:00,416
I'll put another one in.

1497
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,283
Come on, please.

1498
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:09,000
Yeah.

1499
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,100
They got to find another dog
to put inside there.

1500
01:21:12,966 --> 01:21:14,666
Because they're already gotten.

1501
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,950
The what if they're adults?

1502
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,966
Won't that be sad that they run our stock

1503
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:25,950
hello?

1504
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:29,433
Hello.

1505
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,316
Please,

1506
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:35,616
please.

1507
01:21:38,216 --> 01:21:38,650
Oh, no.

1508
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:40,600
Yeah,
we got away. They're going to make a sweet

1509
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,866
I don't know what it says.

1510
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,633
Can somebody translate?
What does that say?

1511
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:48,566
It's like maintenance or something.

1512
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:50,250
Or like.

1513
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,916
Yeah,
they're, like, putting in a new dog. Go

1514
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,400
it says limited dog doing.

1515
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,500
Oh, it's limited. You're right.

1516
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,350
It says it's limited up
here. Fuck me, bro.

1517
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:05,766
No, we have to get one done.

1518
01:22:08,016 --> 01:22:08,616
OK? OK.

1519
01:22:08,616 --> 01:22:11,550
I mean, I see a suckers.

1520
01:22:13,716 --> 01:22:14,850
No, this is.

1521
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,533
Harder.

1522
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:20,316
Oh, this is harder, bro.

1523
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:28,850
Oh, no,

1524
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:33,666
I don't think we're going to get this one.

1525
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:34,650
I don't know how.

1526
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,866
I don't know what I'm.
What am I supposed to do here?

1527
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:39,783
What's what's our what's our game
plan to try and get the dog

1528
01:22:45,216 --> 01:22:45,416
yeah.

1529
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:45,866
This one.

1530
01:22:45,866 --> 01:22:48,383
This one looks so hard

1531
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,966
push the bite.

1532
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:53,550
What?

1533
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,350
What if we just push the bite?

1534
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,350
Yeah, you're right.

1535
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:58,566
What if we just
push the button a little bit?

1536
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:18,550
Put I'm dumb, I'm stupid, I'm stupid.

1537
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,616
I'm so stupid. OK, no, that that's work.

1538
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:21,866
That's a another

1539
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,233
hold on.

1540
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,050
What if I.

1541
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:32,216
I don't know which claw stronger the left
one or the right one?

1542
01:23:33,816 --> 01:23:39,800
The left or the right claw mm.

1543
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:45,216
I can't go to the front.

1544
01:23:45,216 --> 01:23:47,583
It doesn't let me go that far. Guys.

1545
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,300
Come I'm.

1546
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,850
Just going to guess.

1547
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:55,083
That the left one is stronger
and we're going to try to push it,

1548
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,516
try to push it in.

1549
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:07,000
Oh, it kind of, kind of works of it.

1550
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,966
It was, it was a little there

1551
01:24:14,733 --> 01:24:18,366
mm just keep doing

1552
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:20,166
that, really.

1553
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,300
Just keep nudging it like.

1554
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,650
Yeah, I guess so we just got to.

1555
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:28,800
Keep like push pushing off the off
the left stick,

1556
01:24:29,316 --> 01:24:31,566
and then they'll slowly go in right.

1557
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,850
Are the things I am doing.

1558
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,283
For our furry fucking dog.

1559
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:41,550
OK, ok, ok. OK.

1560
01:24:45,516 --> 01:24:46,900
Just like that.

1561
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,266
Oh, oh, that's.

1562
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:52,300
That was very good.

1563
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,366
I think that moved it a little.

1564
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:54,966
Right.

1565
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:57,483
Did it move it a little

1566
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:00,566
I don't know.

1567
01:25:00,566 --> 01:25:01,750
I think it moved a bit.

1568
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,500
Right.

1569
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,133
Just, just a tad bit

1570
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,500
it's a nice one.

1571
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,250
Caufield are oh, this is hard.

1572
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,550
God, why did you do this?

1573
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:19,500
Why did you make it so difficult? God,

1574
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,666
I don't think I can do anything
from the middle.

1575
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:26,250
No, I think in the middle it's not going.

1576
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,500
I like the furthest I can go
is like, right here.

1577
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:31,716
I'm pretty sure

1578
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,783
I just got to keep pushing it like that.

1579
01:25:36,783 --> 01:25:39,300
Maybe I try the left, the right claw.

1580
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,800
Let me see if that helps push it. Put

1581
01:25:56,266 --> 01:25:57,266
it's not even move it

1582
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,166
does that even move it?

1583
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:02,650
I don't know.

1584
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,816
It moved it a.

1585
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:06,300
Bit, but then they, like, want backwards,
like,

1586
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,716
oh, no, I didn't move at all.

1587
01:26:10,716 --> 01:26:13,350
It didn't move.

1588
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,816
It didn't move. Are

1589
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:22,266
look, I'm going to show you guys.

1590
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:23,650
It doesn't go that far.

1591
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:24,033
Hold on.

1592
01:26:24,033 --> 01:26:30,183
We'll give us like this see.

1593
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,950
There's a limit

1594
01:26:40,266 --> 01:26:40,900
so doing

1595
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,733
that is not going to get me anywhere.

1596
01:26:46,716 --> 01:26:47,466
I just had to keep.

1597
01:26:47,466 --> 01:26:49,800
Pushing its butt down

1598
01:26:51,483 --> 01:26:54,750
oh, I want him.

1599
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,916
I really want him, though.

1600
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:57,866
I think. I think I know what I have to do.

1601
01:26:57,866 --> 01:27:00,866
I could chi chi.

1602
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:03,216
Chi Chi chi.

1603
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,916
I have to go this far.

1604
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,100
And then, like. Here

1605
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,650
right? Right.

1606
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:17,766
No, why?

1607
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,183
Why is it so hard?

1608
01:27:21,183 --> 01:27:27,616
Why is it so hard? Oh.

1609
01:27:29,466 --> 01:27:31,450
This is this little guy.

1610
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:33,400
This little guy. He's
not even a little guy.

1611
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,300
He's a big guy. Is just so thick.

1612
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,266
I can't. He's you fat arse.

1613
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:40,833
Come on, go on.

1614
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,833
Go into the hole so I can love you.

1615
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,033
Jesus.

1616
01:27:48,616 --> 01:27:50,583
What if I'm a woman?

1617
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,333
Maybe I tried.

1618
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:54,750
The the right claw.

1619
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:56,700
Go in.

1620
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,783
Go in.

1621
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:00,816
No one saw that.

1622
01:28:00,816 --> 01:28:01,650
Nobody saw that.

1623
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,583
And no one saw that.

1624
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:05,383
I hate, hate, hate, hate.

1625
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,150
Hey, Josh, if you're listening,

1626
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:14,400
can you like clip that part out
from the YouTube video when we upload it?

1627
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,166
Thank you. OK, pretend it didn't happen.

1628
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,600
I don't know what I don't know what I did
there. It was embarrassing.

1629
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,466
Just just get rid of it, please.

1630
01:28:20,466 --> 01:28:21,300
Thank you.

1631
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:23,583
Oh, oh,

1632
01:28:27,366 --> 01:28:28,000
I feel like my.

1633
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,666
Depth perception is an issue here at CNN.

1634
01:28:31,483 --> 01:28:32,383
I could

1635
01:28:45,716 --> 01:28:47,950
I don't know.

1636
01:28:48,183 --> 01:28:50,466
I don't know.

1637
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,533
It's someone help.

1638
01:28:55,533 --> 01:28:57,300
OK, ok. I'm open. I'm open to.

1639
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,716
Listening to opinions right now.

1640
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:00,333
What do we do, guys?

1641
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:01,716
What am I supposed to do here?

1642
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:02,916
Try and get this one done?

1643
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:05,100
Like the round made sense. It was a box.

1644
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,000
I just, like, shimmy
the box around, right?

1645
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,700
But this dog is so, like.

1646
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,416
Resilience.
He doesn't want to go for walkies.

1647
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:14,350
I'm trying to, like, you know, get on.

1648
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,250
So go for walkies.

1649
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,866
Yes, I want to go

1650
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:23,350
just push it down the middle.

1651
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:26,700
That's all I've been trying to do.

1652
01:29:27,516 --> 01:29:29,716
Oh no.

1653
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,716
Oh, no.

1654
01:29:31,716 --> 01:29:34,416
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1655
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,783
Oh, no.

1656
01:29:38,316 --> 01:29:41,066
Chi Chi.

1657
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:44,100
Put the six of all to the left

1658
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,216
claw being the superior claw

1659
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:48,600
and trying to.

1660
01:29:52,016 --> 01:29:53,883
Hit a loop

1661
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:57,100
oh, it doesn't.

1662
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,050
Work.

1663
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:05,583
Why doesn't it work, bro?

1664
01:30:06,866 --> 01:30:08,516
Lift the back.

1665
01:30:08,516 --> 01:30:10,650
I feel like it's too heavy to lift.

1666
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,550
He's too.

1667
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,466
He's too big

1668
01:30:13,516 --> 01:30:15,033
because he's too big. I don't.

1669
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:16,750
I can't like, you know, I just.

1670
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,216
I had to push him.

1671
01:30:18,216 --> 01:30:18,783
I got to.

1672
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:22,450
Push a button. Oh,

1673
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,750
I mean, look,

1674
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,583
I could try lifting this, but, no, I
don't think that's going to be a good idea

1675
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:34,600
that you see, I'll push him more inwards.

1676
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,766
Right? For

1677
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,466
maybe I got to go.

1678
01:30:44,466 --> 01:30:46,650
A little further out.

1679
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,950
Study beginning and

1680
01:30:52,383 --> 01:30:53,500
here you go.

1681
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,650
That looks like it works, I think.

1682
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:04,366
And all sides.

1683
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,816
We've made no progress.

1684
01:31:09,816 --> 01:31:11,666
We've made zero progress.

1685
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:13,300
Look at that.

1686
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,650
It's it's
still in the same spot since we started

1687
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:23,466
it kind of it kind of moved a little.

1688
01:31:23,466 --> 01:31:26,250
Bit to the to the right. Right.

1689
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:35,500
It moved a bit OK.

1690
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:35,950
All right.

1691
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:36,550
All right.

1692
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:41,966
I feel like
I feel like it moved a bit and moved.

1693
01:31:41,966 --> 01:31:42,866
A slight bit.

1694
01:31:42,866 --> 01:31:46,650
OK, just ever so slightly, though.

1695
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:48,450
Some like keep saying try the middle.

1696
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,950
I don't know if that's a good idea.

1697
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:53,016
What if I try pushing the middle down.

1698
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,433
I could.

1699
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,816
Oh, that did not work.

1700
01:32:17,766 --> 01:32:18,450
His butt.

1701
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,333
His body's too big, man.

1702
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,516
His body's way too big.

1703
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:27,066
I can't see anything on the tail
that tells not possible.

1704
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:28,950
I can't, like, pinch the tail.

1705
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:31,050
It's not how the screen gives that.

1706
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,033
It doesn't work that way.

1707
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:41,700
Mm oh, man.

1708
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,766
Oh, man.

1709
01:32:45,116 --> 01:32:46,766
Help help.

1710
01:32:46,766 --> 01:32:49,533
Somebody. Oh, that's good. There

1711
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,983
I the only thing I can think of,
I'll just keep pushing it.

1712
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,666
But there's no progress.

1713
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,550
I keep trying to push
I keep trying to push

1714
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:05,733
on that. I go too far up.

1715
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:07,300
It can go too far.

1716
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:23,433
That's that's fine.

1717
01:33:23,433 --> 01:33:24,483
It's it's still.

1718
01:33:24,483 --> 01:33:25,533
Pushed it a bit.

1719
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,433
I'm just

1720
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:31,016
like,

1721
01:33:32,516 --> 01:33:33,966
what? What do I do?

1722
01:33:33,966 --> 01:33:35,400
What do I do?

1723
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,650
Pull the tail.

1724
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:39,000
Someone says bullets l by Kemp.

1725
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,900
Pinch it

1726
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:44,666
guys.

1727
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:46,416
Like I said before,
we can't lift the head.

1728
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:47,950
It doesn't go that far back.

1729
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:50,500
It doesn't go that far back.

1730
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,816
We can't go for the head.

1731
01:33:51,816 --> 01:33:54,866
Yeah that's a keep trying the bite
and I don't know what to do of the bite.

1732
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:58,833
The legs go for the legs

1733
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:08,583
my cats.

1734
01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:11,616
Maybe they'll be nice to me again.

1735
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:13,566
Maybe.

1736
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:16,316
Maybe they'll be kind.

1737
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,166
It's lower it. I

1738
01:34:22,133 --> 01:34:24,200
oh yeah.

1739
01:34:27,366 --> 01:34:28,466
Can I get can you help.

1740
01:34:28,466 --> 01:34:30,266
Stuff, stuff, stuff.

1741
01:34:30,266 --> 01:34:32,700
Assist, assist, assistance.

1742
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:39,283
Oh. And

1743
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,800
people keep saying go for the white.

1744
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,133
Bars, but I don't know what to do
at the white bars.

1745
01:34:45,183 --> 01:34:47,650
Right. What I do at the white bars.

1746
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,566
Is there something special?

1747
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:52,050
What's,
what's special about the white bars?

1748
01:34:54,983 --> 01:34:57,433
I can.

1749
01:34:57,733 --> 01:35:01,966
Move these.

1750
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:05,316
I don't know what to do.

1751
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,583
Did I help

1752
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:21,066
did I help the help?

1753
01:35:21,066 --> 01:35:21,866
I think I helped.

1754
01:35:21,866 --> 01:35:23,183
It moved a bit

1755
01:35:26,216 --> 01:35:27,516
oh, my God, it moved a bit.

1756
01:35:27,516 --> 01:35:29,900
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1757
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:30,683
Yeah, yeah.

1758
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:32,366
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:35:32,366 --> 01:35:34,166
Yeah, yeah.

1760
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,016
Dude, I.

1761
01:35:37,016 --> 01:35:39,366
Feel like I'm on mad coaching right now
because of you guys.

1762
01:35:41,733 --> 01:35:42,933
Like, I feel like it's moving.

1763
01:35:42,933 --> 01:35:45,300
I don't know if
it's moving or not. Actually,

1764
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:52,783
did it move again?

1765
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,033
I think it did.

1766
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:00,416
Holy shit.

1767
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:01,200
Holy shit.

1768
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,516
Holy shit.

1769
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,133
Oh, my God.

1770
01:36:05,133 --> 01:36:06,033
OK, I'll try.

1771
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:08,050
I'll try to keep doing that.

1772
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:08,966
Because it seems.

1773
01:36:08,966 --> 01:36:11,966
Like it's going to work if I
just, you know, pinch hit from the middle.

1774
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:18,800
On. Top.

1775
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,033
The young girl, young.

1776
01:36:21,033 --> 01:36:24,033
Copy and copy and copy on.

1777
01:36:31,616 --> 01:36:31,750
Four.

1778
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,766
One, one.

1779
01:36:32,766 --> 01:36:34,066
Come on, come on.

1780
01:36:34,066 --> 01:36:35,666
Whoa.

1781
01:36:37,616 --> 01:36:38,550
So do I.

1782
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:41,316
Do I do good that I do good there.

1783
01:36:41,316 --> 01:36:42,266
I think I did good there.

1784
01:36:42,266 --> 01:36:44,016
OK, ok.

1785
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:49,016
It feels like it's not moving at all.

1786
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:53,066
I can't tell

1787
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:58,383
I can't tell anymore.

1788
01:36:58,383 --> 01:37:00,600
Guys, it feels like we're getting nowhere.

1789
01:37:00,866 --> 01:37:02,666
Oh, no.

1790
01:37:04,316 --> 01:37:07,266
Babe, it hasn't moved, so

1791
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:08,733
maybe it did.

1792
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:10,166
I mean, I just got to keep trying.

1793
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:11,650
It like that. Right?

1794
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:14,416
I could mm.

1795
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:14,883
Mm hmm.

1796
01:37:18,816 --> 01:37:22,000
All this for a fucking dog.

1797
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:29,100
It didn't move.

1798
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,783
That one did move.

1799
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,300
Oh, God, it didn't move.

1800
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,416
There a jim over with

1801
01:37:41,916 --> 01:37:42,566
I don't know.

1802
01:37:42,566 --> 01:37:44,066
I don't know.

1803
01:37:50,516 --> 01:37:52,150
I'm lost my brains.

1804
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,450
I'm a mind broke tag.

1805
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,383
You guys mind broke? Tagged me
this game is mine.

1806
01:37:55,383 --> 01:37:56,883
Broke, tagged me.

1807
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:59,466
I'm just like where

1808
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,433
I'm trying so hard.

1809
01:38:02,433 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm trying so hard to like, you.

1810
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,783
Know, calculate the the angles, the the

1811
01:38:07,866 --> 01:38:12,633
the do the the quantum physics, the
the integrals, the the you.

1812
01:38:12,633 --> 01:38:14,166
Know, the quadratic.

1813
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:16,950
Equation, the the right angle, the

1814
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:19,833
the tangents, the Sokoto.

1815
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,216
The the

1816
01:38:22,483 --> 01:38:25,716
the the derivative of of his arse.

1817
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:29,733
And it's not making any sense

1818
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:33,783
like, where do I go, man?

1819
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,133
Oh, man.

1820
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:36,900
I guess
I'll just keep trying for the middle.

1821
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,566
Part.

1822
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:54,600
And looks like they really want me to go
for that gap area.

1823
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,066
Thing.

1824
01:38:56,966 --> 01:38:57,550
He moved.

1825
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:59,966
He moved, he moved. He moved.
You can't lie to me there.

1826
01:39:00,033 --> 01:39:02,616
He moved a little bit.
He moved a little bit. OK, OK.

1827
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:03,816
He's again, he's getting in there.

1828
01:39:03,816 --> 01:39:06,483
He's getting in there slowly.

1829
01:39:06,483 --> 01:39:09,966
It's it's kind of working.

1830
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:10,950
Oh, my God.

1831
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:12,550
Why is this so.

1832
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:14,733
Why are you so fat, bro?

1833
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:19,116
I used to be so chunky.

1834
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:27,350
Oh, oh, oh, no, man.

1835
01:39:27,366 --> 01:39:28,200
Old man.

1836
01:39:29,766 --> 01:39:31,266
Maybe, maybe. That it's all yours.

1837
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:33,600
Yeah. Taking on a dog years will help.

1838
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:37,800
Oh, they're already on pot.

1839
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,533
All right.

1840
01:39:44,516 --> 01:39:45,933
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1841
01:39:45,933 --> 01:39:48,550
You know you want to come. You want to
you know you want to come home.

1842
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,716
Come home with me.

1843
01:39:49,716 --> 01:39:50,850
You want to come home with me?

1844
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,833
No. Ow, ow, ow. Oh.

1845
01:39:59,066 --> 01:40:00,066
All right, all right.

1846
01:40:00,066 --> 01:40:01,166
So what I'm.

1847
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:02,883
What I'm getting at is I.

1848
01:40:02,883 --> 01:40:04,866
Have to, like, lift underneath it.

1849
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:06,333
All right? Now,

1850
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:09,433
just keep lifting underneath this.

1851
01:40:09,433 --> 01:40:12,950
Going under shuffle

1852
01:40:15,866 --> 01:40:17,883
still play.

1853
01:40:17,883 --> 01:40:20,016
Crane game is getting me all worked up.

1854
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:25,950
That didn't do.

1855
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:26,850
Anything.

1856
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:29,816
Ah. Oh.

1857
01:40:32,883 --> 01:40:37,416
Uh that one's.

1858
01:40:37,416 --> 01:40:39,333
In. Do anything, guys.

1859
01:40:40,016 --> 01:40:41,450
All this, this. This is rough.

1860
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,783
The phones are off

1861
01:40:46,016 --> 01:40:48,000
please, please advise somebody.

1862
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,850
Somebody give me some advice.
Mods. It's smart. Predictions. Who?

1863
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:51,416
I don't know.

1864
01:40:51,416 --> 01:40:55,083
Like, I'm going to get no prediction
going.

1865
01:40:57,416 --> 01:40:58,950
Everyone that says

1866
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:01,233
that keeps saying try the dog head.

1867
01:41:01,233 --> 01:41:02,466
I can't do that.

1868
01:41:02,466 --> 01:41:03,966
I've said it so many times already.

1869
01:41:03,966 --> 01:41:06,783
It doesn't let me go that far.

1870
01:41:09,216 --> 01:41:09,816
I don't know what.

1871
01:41:09,816 --> 01:41:12,483
I it's we have a vulnerable.

1872
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,216
Vulnerable.

1873
01:41:14,733 --> 01:41:16,716
Gulf between the bars but keep.

1874
01:41:16,716 --> 01:41:18,716
Shifting between left and right. Claw.

1875
01:41:19,383 --> 01:41:21,700
I just got to shimmy switch.

1876
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,916
Between left and right. Claw.

1877
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:30,933
Huh? Cat OK,

1878
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:39,600
ooh, that's good.

1879
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,583
That's really good.

1880
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,066
That wasn't. Really good.

1881
01:41:44,066 --> 01:41:46,166
That was not good at all.

1882
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,050
Oh, my goodness.

1883
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,266
Oh, my goodness.

1884
01:41:54,866 --> 01:41:58,383
If I maybe I try left side now,
I would try left side out.

1885
01:41:58,383 --> 01:42:00,933
OK, left side of side.

1886
01:42:00,933 --> 01:42:03,150
Put that

1887
01:42:07,383 --> 01:42:08,400
all right.

1888
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:19,050
Oh, no.

1889
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:24,366
No, no, no. Ah.

1890
01:42:29,766 --> 01:42:30,850
Somebody, are you done?

1891
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:32,650
Me basket.

1892
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:35,350
Help, help, help!

1893
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:39,700
God, if there's a God,

1894
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,550
if there's a god, please help.

1895
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:44,500
Help me help!

1896
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,516
Me God.

1897
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,216
I can't see anything.

1898
01:42:48,216 --> 01:42:50,500
What the hell
I really do. It's a pretty nice cell.

1899
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,816
I want to pull on. The tail so bad.

1900
01:42:51,816 --> 01:42:54,033
So it looks really cute,
but I can't do anything with the tail

1901
01:42:56,066 --> 01:42:57,116
stuff. Awesome.

1902
01:42:57,116 --> 01:43:00,333
Come calm, please. Please.

1903
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:02,433
I need to save my friend.

1904
01:43:02,433 --> 01:43:04,466
He's. He's stuck in. He's
stuck in your crane game.

1905
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,883
He's not supposed to be here.

1906
01:43:05,883 --> 01:43:07,950
He's supposed
to. He's supposed to be with me.

1907
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,866
I don't think this is
not is not where he's meant to be.

1908
01:43:10,866 --> 01:43:12,300
I'm trying. Get him out of here.

1909
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:16,166
Help!

1910
01:43:16,316 --> 01:43:19,550
Help! Him!

1911
01:43:23,366 --> 01:43:26,066
Maybe if I

1912
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:26,916
just.

1913
01:43:27,133 --> 01:43:29,350
I'm pushing would try pushing it again.

1914
01:43:31,616 --> 01:43:34,316
Let's try pushing him down one more time.

1915
01:43:35,433 --> 01:43:39,333
Like in closer to the bar.

1916
01:43:44,016 --> 01:43:44,500
You see, it

1917
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:47,666
looks like it does something,
but then it doesn't actually do anything.

1918
01:43:47,883 --> 01:43:49,150
All I'm doing there.

1919
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:50,883
Is just, like,

1920
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:53,616
all really done.

1921
01:43:53,616 --> 01:43:56,650
There is just, like,
you know, poking his fat, and it's not.

1922
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:58,316
It's not doing much

1923
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:06,150
that up with them, but up, up.

1924
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:07,900
This music is going to make me lose it

1925
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:11,950
till OK.

1926
01:44:14,516 --> 01:44:16,650
I'm just going to try
and lift it up from the middle

1927
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,150
every single time.

1928
01:44:19,533 --> 01:44:21,000
I don't know, man.

1929
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,200
I don't know.

1930
01:44:28,533 --> 01:44:30,183
I can't even tell anymore.

1931
01:44:30,183 --> 01:44:32,216
If it moves, it

1932
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:36,000
oh, my God.

1933
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,900
I can't.

1934
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,266
I can't even salvage
moves it anymore, guys.

1935
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:46,983
I suppose

1936
01:44:46,983 --> 01:44:49,683
you want me to censor the claw

1937
01:44:50,816 --> 01:44:53,350
censor the claw.

1938
01:44:58,083 --> 01:44:59,733
Please catch this dog.

1939
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:02,250
Don't waste my mana fruits.

1940
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,416
Please catch this dog.

1941
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:06,333
I'm shy. I'm going to try my best.

1942
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:07,766
It's hard out here.

1943
01:45:07,766 --> 01:45:10,166
It's really hard out here.

1944
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,700
Oh. That's a good spot.

1945
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,616
That's a really good spot.

1946
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,650
Oh, you say, move it, move it, move it.

1947
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,366
Fucking move.

1948
01:45:23,366 --> 01:45:25,833
I saw a fucking move. You can't lie to me
now. That fucker moved.

1949
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,550
He moved. Oh, my God.

1950
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:29,400
I saw you, bitch.

1951
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,150
We made

1952
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:38,583
we made, like, y a little bit of progress.

1953
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:47,283
Oh, oh, no.

1954
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:51,633
We got.

1955
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,733
Like, a figure out. It's

1956
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:57,033
the whole

1957
01:46:00,216 --> 01:46:02,916
way. Just keep moving up from the back,

1958
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:06,566
like near the back part of the bar.

1959
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,066
This is such a scoundrel.

1960
01:46:09,066 --> 01:46:09,750
Why am I doing it?

1961
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:13,350
I'm flying into their into
their into their hands. Man.

1962
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:15,550
Yeah.

1963
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:18,450
Hi. Cat

1964
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,016
VI. Want him so bad

1965
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,700
I want I want him so bad.

1966
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:26,250
I want you so bad.

1967
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,883
Why is your butt so fat?

1968
01:46:32,883 --> 01:46:35,516
Why? Why

1969
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:45,366
what can I do.

1970
01:46:45,366 --> 01:46:46,800
For what can I do here?

1971
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,566
It's like so it's to make it easier for
myself.

1972
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,100
I'm not sure.

1973
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:58,866
We've tried everything.

1974
01:46:58,866 --> 01:47:01,450
We've tried everything.

1975
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,450
I i backround.

1976
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:05,950
Ok. Left.

1977
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:11,316
Someone said left middle cut.

1978
01:47:16,466 --> 01:47:18,516
My right there.

1979
01:47:32,233 --> 01:47:35,966
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1980
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,300
Well.

1981
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,150
It's not.

1982
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:43,250
It's hmm.

1983
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,266
I feel like if I give up now.

1984
01:47:46,266 --> 01:47:48,700
If I give up now,

1985
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:52,633
it's it's not gonna you know. Oh.

1986
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:56,400
I got to get a air.

1987
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,066
Yes, you go get help.

1988
01:47:59,066 --> 01:48:01,416
Please help me.

1989
01:48:01,716 --> 01:48:02,516
I know you're there.

1990
01:48:02,516 --> 01:48:05,366
I know you're watching me suffer
you're probably laughing right now.

1991
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,416
He's probably, like, on the or she.

1992
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:08,650
I don't know someone.

1993
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:12,750
He's just, like, grinning and smiling
at the fact that I'm fucking a up

1994
01:48:14,216 --> 01:48:16,316
is, like, a, like, basking.

1995
01:48:16,316 --> 01:48:18,250
In my failure.

1996
01:48:19,316 --> 01:48:21,333
I can't hear you laugh,
but I'm pretty sure you.

1997
01:48:21,333 --> 01:48:24,650
There. Mm.

1998
01:48:27,516 --> 01:48:29,616
OK. Uh.

1999
01:48:31,450 --> 01:48:33,216
Don't give up. I'm
not going to give up now.

2000
01:48:33,216 --> 01:48:34,000
We don't give up.

2001
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,733
We don't give up here.

2002
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:44,916
Quite like you cheering that noise.

2003
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:47,483
And it makes me think like

2004
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:51,633
it makes me sad.

2005
01:48:51,633 --> 01:48:53,616
It's no longer joy.

2006
01:48:53,616 --> 01:48:54,966
This is not like ram.

2007
01:48:54,966 --> 01:48:57,483
The Ram box is pretty easy.

2008
01:48:57,483 --> 01:48:59,850
It moved a bit again. It moved a little.

2009
01:48:59,850 --> 01:49:02,616
But how many more times
are we going to have to do this?

2010
01:49:07,233 --> 01:49:10,600
Why are you being so difficult, bro?

2011
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,216
How many? How many tries every have.

2012
01:49:12,216 --> 01:49:14,366
You given it, by the way?

2013
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,466
How many how many tries has it been?

2014
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:25,350
Like 50 hmm.

2015
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:31,450
I think.

2016
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:34,016
Like ten.

2017
01:49:34,016 --> 01:49:37,083
What do you mean, ten? It's answered ten.

2018
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:43,150
Ok. OK.

2019
01:49:44,583 --> 01:49:45,416
Push it.

2020
01:49:45,416 --> 01:49:46,983
Push it some.

2021
01:49:46,983 --> 01:49:51,716
As someone who has spent a lot of money
on train games, I think you need to wait.

2022
01:49:51,716 --> 01:49:54,816
People play to move it more
so you catch it all you will.

2023
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:57,000
Spent a lot of money on this.

2024
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,583
No, I got to. I got to try.

2025
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:01,750
I got to try. I just got to keep trying.

2026
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,616
I fully believe God will show up, ok?

2027
01:50:04,766 --> 01:50:06,450
We just got to believe in God.
We got this.

2028
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:09,666
We can come up and him to help us.

2029
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,100
Whoever the staff is.
They'll come eventually.

2030
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,366
We'll come around
and be like all they feel.

2031
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,916
They'll feel bad, right?

2032
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:19,116
And be like, oh, this is this little guy.

2033
01:50:19,116 --> 01:50:22,166
He's trying his best, but he's not get

2034
01:50:22,683 --> 01:50:23,666
he's not getting here.

2035
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:25,350
And then they'll.

2036
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:28,383
All they'll throw me a bone
to literally throw me a bone.

2037
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,933
Paul I'm stuck.

2038
01:50:36,933 --> 01:50:37,766
Stuck, bro.

2039
01:50:37,766 --> 01:50:39,216
I'm still stuck

2040
01:50:40,383 --> 01:50:41,100
like this.

2041
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,866
Like I'm a moulding.

2042
01:50:42,866 --> 01:50:46,300
I think I'm moulding weight I actually.

2043
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:47,016
Think

2044
01:50:47,966 --> 01:50:50,850
I think I'm moulding
and moulding a moulding

2045
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:54,300
or moulding no more.

2046
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:58,733
Which I get the copy amount already.

2047
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,533
Maybe I should just get the copier now.

2048
01:51:07,533 --> 01:51:09,783
Hold on, hold on. Give me one second.

2049
01:51:09,783 --> 01:51:12,266
Give me, like, 2 seconds. OK,

2050
01:51:14,366 --> 01:51:16,050
where's my copy? On

2051
01:51:23,616 --> 01:51:24,750
here it is.

2052
01:51:26,816 --> 01:51:27,300
I found it.

2053
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,366
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Give me
give me a second.

2054
01:51:29,366 --> 01:51:29,950
Give me a second.

2055
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:30,333
I'm just.

2056
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,816
I'm just the.

2057
01:51:36,066 --> 01:51:39,116
I'm just preparing myself for a really

2058
01:51:42,366 --> 01:51:44,066
unfortunate.

2059
01:51:44,066 --> 01:51:46,200
Oh, my God. Looks so dumb.

2060
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,116
This looks so dumb.

2061
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,616
It looks so stupid.

2062
01:51:57,616 --> 01:52:01,366
And why does it look so stupid, man?

2063
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:06,033
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2064
01:52:06,033 --> 01:52:06,816
It kicked me out.

2065
01:52:06,816 --> 01:52:07,983
No, it kicked me out.

2066
01:52:07,983 --> 01:52:11,200
No, no. The timer. No,

2067
01:52:13,283 --> 01:52:15,400
oh, no, no.

2068
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:17,316
The timer. Shit.

2069
01:52:17,316 --> 01:52:18,966
Please. Oh, fuck.

2070
01:52:18,966 --> 01:52:21,550
Oh, no.

2071
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:24,183
Oh, no way.

2072
01:52:24,183 --> 01:52:26,583
I forgot about the timer. I was so.

2073
01:52:26,616 --> 01:52:30,600
I was so all

2074
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,300
oh, that's so sad.

2075
01:52:39,666 --> 01:52:40,366
Hold on, hold on.

2076
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:42,066
I'm coming back on. Come back.
Give me a second.

2077
01:52:42,066 --> 01:52:43,983
Give me a second. All right.

2078
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,450
Oh, you God.

2079
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,316
Maybe they didn't.

2080
01:52:49,316 --> 01:52:52,533
Maybe they didn't realise that
there is no God

2081
01:52:52,533 --> 01:52:54,366
damn it. I

2082
01:52:59,066 --> 01:53:00,516
I forgot about the time limit.

2083
01:53:00,516 --> 01:53:05,050

2084
01:53:05,050 --> 01:53:06,850
I got cocked. I got cocked, man.

2085
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:09,183
I got cock so hard.

2086
01:53:10,766 --> 01:53:11,500
Hey, hey.

2087
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:12,366
If you're in line.

And you can hear this, can you,
can you look you can, you can look.

01:53:16,016 --> 01:53:17,550
Can you like you.

Lost my spot.

2091
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:20,583
I lost my spot. I'm so dumb I'm so dumb.

2092
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:21,633
I forgot, man.

2093
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:26,200
Help, help.

Oh, no.

01:53:30,816 --> 01:53:32,950
Oh, no. Oh, no.

2096
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:35,050
Lift the box from time to time.

2097
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,333
You can do it.

2098
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:38,350
Lift the butt soon.

2099
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,583

2100
01:53:41,583 --> 01:53:44,216
I got cock though there is a there's.

2101
01:53:45,816 --> 01:53:47,200
No he's.

2102
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,866
Playing now.

2103
01:53:49,533 --> 01:53:52,866
I know all

2104
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:03,516
I know.

2105
01:54:03,516 --> 01:54:06,183
OK, is really just wait here.

01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,366

2108
01:54:16,116 --> 01:54:18,550
But then what
if one of the staff comes in.

2109
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,550
And and then I just you know,

2110
01:54:24,033 --> 01:54:25,166
oh, fuck off.

2111
01:54:25,166 --> 01:54:26,066
Fuck.

2112
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,650
I think, I think I got I think.

2113
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:30,783
I think it's G-men. I don't know.

2114
01:54:31,316 --> 01:54:32,883

01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,700
watch and learn.

2118
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:45,266
What do you mean, watch and learn?

2119
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:48,400
Does this person know what they're doing?

2120
01:54:54,966 --> 01:54:55,750
Oh, they left.

2121
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,650
Oh, they left. Wait,
they left. OK, ok, ok.

2122
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:00,850
Maybe there's there's a chance.
There's a chance.

2123
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:02,500
I'm like, next in line.

2124
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,116
I think the other person might be afk

2125
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:06,816
I hope.

2126
01:55:08,283 --> 01:55:09,416
Oh my god.

2127
01:55:09,416 --> 01:55:11,316
I'm so stupid. I keep.

2128
01:55:11,316 --> 01:55:14,766
Why did I just, like,
leave my place in lines of fucking love

2129
01:55:14,766 --> 01:55:18,700
for copious hmm?

2130
01:55:20,016 --> 01:55:21,416
Maybe he gave up.

2131
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:22,383
I think he did give up.

2132
01:55:22,383 --> 01:55:25,016
Now there's just one person
in front of me.

2133
01:55:25,016 --> 01:55:26,500
Come on, come on. Don't, don't, don't.

2134
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:29,050
NCR me. Please don't answer me.
Let me have it.

2135
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:31,466
Let me have it, girl. Go, go.
Get out of here.

2136
01:55:31,466 --> 01:55:32,966
Get out of here.

2137
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:41,283
Is he you in there?

2138
01:55:41,283 --> 01:55:42,416
Hello?

2139
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:44,400
There might be all right.

2140
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,416
Be gone.

2141
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:50,500
And C.R..

2142
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,166
I'm going. I'm going and see Artie.

2143
01:55:52,166 --> 01:55:54,150
Yeah, I just.

I just want the dog and and.

2145
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:00,000
I don't know.

2146
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,900
I'm afraid.

2147
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,416
I'm afraid.

2148
01:56:01,416 --> 01:56:05,216
Like, stuff is going to pop up here
any second now

2149
01:56:05,366 --> 01:56:07,533
and, like, oh, you're still on it. But,
no, it's not me.

2150
01:56:07,533 --> 01:56:09,116
It's a. Different person. Oh,

2151
01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:16,166
oh, oh, oh, oh.

2152
01:56:16,383 --> 01:56:17,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2153
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,333
Blah, blah. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

2154
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,733
OK, I'm back, I'm back, baby.

2155
01:56:20,733 --> 01:56:22,716
I'm back, I'm back.

2156
01:56:24,783 --> 01:56:26,816
I got so scared.

2157
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,800
I got so scared I was going to lose a dog.

2158
01:56:30,716 --> 01:56:33,966
OK, it's not really my god.

2159
01:56:41,133 --> 01:56:42,150
Is this even worth it?

2160
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:44,433
Maybe it's a sign. Maybe, guys.

2161
01:56:44,433 --> 01:56:45,516
Maybe it's a. Sign.

2162
01:56:45,516 --> 01:56:48,216
That I should just stop

2163
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,333
right?

2164
01:56:56,133 --> 01:56:56,850
Because look out.

2165
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:58,600
Look at what happened.

2166
01:57:00,566 --> 01:57:01,200
Nothing.

2167
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,483
Nothing happened. It barely moved.

2168
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:07,166
It's barely even moved this entire time.

2169
01:57:12,066 --> 01:57:14,066
The things I'd seen before

2170
01:57:14,066 --> 01:57:17,516
for a stuffed animal, for

2171
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:22,450
just for one.

2172
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:23,883
Big boy

2173
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:30,633
every time I do that, it looks like it

2174
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:33,933
moves a bit from the front, but.

2175
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,500
Don't stop right there.

2176
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,566
You don't stop.

2177
01:57:40,233 --> 01:57:41,466
They said don't stop.

2178
01:57:47,066 --> 01:57:50,216
Oh, help, help, help.

2179
01:57:50,366 --> 01:57:52,383
How, how. How.

2180
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:55,600
How how, how

2181
01:57:59,766 --> 01:58:01,916
who do I have to pray to the gotcha?

2182
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:02,950
God's

2183
01:58:09,783 --> 01:58:12,183
pushing with one arm.

2184
01:58:12,266 --> 01:58:15,500
And that's what I'm trying to do.

2185
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,866
OK, maybe.

2186
01:58:18,866 --> 01:58:21,033
Let me let me try. And.

2187
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:24,750
Push you over here.

2188
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:27,266
A bit like right before the bar.

2189
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:30,633
And see if that's like, good enough.

2190
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,816
I kind of did something.

2191
01:58:35,816 --> 01:58:37,916
It kind of did something, didn't it?

2192
01:58:38,016 --> 01:58:40,116
It looks like it did

2193
01:58:45,633 --> 01:58:46,600
didn't it?

2194
01:58:46,716 --> 01:58:47,500
I can't.

2195
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:47,966
I can't.

2196
01:58:47,966 --> 01:58:51,350
Oh, I really don't know.

2197
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:54,316
I could.

2198
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:00,616
Well,

2199
01:59:08,333 --> 01:59:10,366
it looks like it's working.

2200
01:59:10,366 --> 01:59:12,533
It looks like it's working now.

2201
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,800
Also a damn. Dog.

2202
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,416
Ah ha ha.

2203
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:25,166
Man, I.

2204
01:59:25,166 --> 01:59:25,766
I don't know.

2205
01:59:25,766 --> 01:59:28,200
I feel like I wanna eat. My shoe

2206
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,216
on the issue.

2207
01:59:29,216 --> 01:59:31,266
Yeah, I'm going to eat you. Yummy. No, no.

2208
01:59:31,266 --> 01:59:32,900
I feel like I'm eating
my shoe because of this,

2209
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:34,700
I can't believe it's

2210
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:37,666
taking this long
just to get one of them dog.

2211
01:59:37,716 --> 01:59:41,550
Just one damn dog. Hmm.

2212
01:59:47,633 --> 01:59:48,316
Maybe if.

2213
01:59:48,316 --> 01:59:50,550
I move a little bit. More.

2214
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,566
Over here.

2215
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:56,150
What that's how that

2216
01:59:58,050 --> 01:59:59,000
right here.

2217
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,650
Right here, right here.

2218
02:00:11,716 --> 02:00:13,583
I'm so bad at this.

2219
02:00:13,583 --> 02:00:16,166
Oh. I am so bad at.

2220
02:00:16,166 --> 02:00:17,850
This guy's.

2221
02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:20,533
Like,

2222
02:00:22,583 --> 02:00:24,533
I've never had such an issue

2223
02:00:24,533 --> 02:00:26,866
of occurring in before.

2224
02:00:27,566 --> 02:00:29,666
He's just so thick

2225
02:00:30,166 --> 02:00:30,750
this big.

2226
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:33,383
This is just so thick.

2227
02:00:38,366 --> 02:00:38,750
I don't.

2228
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:41,216
I can't even tell that moved him

2229
02:00:44,033 --> 02:00:44,666
grab the middle

2230
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:46,733
like you're doing before,
because actually worked like that.

2231
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,100
Didn't work to me.

2232
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:52,633
Grabbing it like that work

2233
02:00:52,633 --> 02:00:55,466
really what what it did,

2234
02:00:56,083 --> 02:00:59,150
I could did.

2235
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:02,033
He really did it really work?

2236
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:04,466
Like right here.

2237
02:01:04,466 --> 02:01:06,950
So I said keep grabbing
like right here and walk slowly.

2238
02:01:10,966 --> 02:01:11,416
Oh, my.

2239
02:01:11,416 --> 02:01:13,550
God. Here. You're working, dude.
You're right.

2240
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:15,383
Oh, my God, you're right.

2241
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:18,566
Holy shit.

2242
02:01:18,566 --> 02:01:19,700
You're right.

2243
02:01:22,616 --> 02:01:23,600
It's kind of there.

2244
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:25,433
It's kind of working.

2245
02:01:25,433 --> 02:01:26,366
This guy.

2246
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,466
Oh, my God. I just got it.

2247
02:01:28,466 --> 02:01:31,800
OK? Like.

2248
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:33,950
Somebody gave me more money.

2249
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:35,266
To gamble

2250
02:01:37,016 --> 02:01:39,166
feeding my addiction.

2251
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,666
Jesus, man.

2252
02:01:48,666 --> 02:01:50,900
Oh, is it is.

2253
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,500
Rough out here, boys.

2254
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,833
It's really rough out here.

2255
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:02,016
Mm hmm.

2256
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:03,983
How much more?

2257
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:06,016
How much more

2258
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,416
Just give it to me.

2259
02:02:11,416 --> 02:02:13,433
Just give me the dog.

2260
02:02:13,433 --> 02:02:15,466
Please, please,

2261
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:21,650
oh, my God.

2262
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:22,666
I think you know what?

2263
02:02:22,666 --> 02:02:24,000
I think I got to go further.

2264
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,366
Into the middle

2265
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:30,166
I think I need to go further
into the yard.

2266
02:02:30,166 --> 02:02:32,783
To the middle,
like in between the bars and the, ah.

2267
02:02:33,066 --> 02:02:35,783
The platform kind.

2268
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,550
OK, let's try that this time.

2269
02:02:41,933 --> 02:02:42,200
Great.

2270
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,583
There am.

2271
02:02:43,583 --> 02:02:44,483
I work

2272
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:52,166
kind of, I think.

2273
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,783
I don't know.

2274
02:02:56,116 --> 02:02:58,033
He's getting closer

2275
02:02:59,566 --> 02:03:01,550
he's going to walk closer.

2276
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:03,000
Is he?

2277
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,200
I don't know.

2278
02:03:04,316 --> 02:03:06,000
Is he?

2279
02:03:06,983 --> 02:03:08,483
Yeah, I don't know.

2280
02:03:08,483 --> 02:03:10,283
Is there like a before and after.

2281
02:03:10,283 --> 02:03:11,816
I really want to see the before and.

2282
02:03:11,816 --> 02:03:13,350
After from when we started.

2283
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:15,600
It's like to this point, I can't.

2284
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,383
I can't tell

2285
02:03:32,866 --> 02:03:34,100
Come on, come on, come on.

2286
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:37,200
Go, go, go, go. Why,

2287
02:03:38,266 --> 02:03:41,150
dog, you dog, please.

2288
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:43,700
I'm losing faith now.

2289
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:45,566
I'm losing faith now.

2290
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:51,050
Oh, my God.

2291
02:03:54,016 --> 02:03:56,300
I'm losing faith.

2292
02:03:57,166 --> 02:03:58,466
I'm losing so much faith.

2293
02:03:58,466 --> 02:03:59,100
It's hard.

2294
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:01,250
It's hard, man.

2295
02:04:10,216 --> 02:04:12,916
Oh, wow.

2296
02:04:12,916 --> 02:04:14,450
All right, all right, all right.

2297
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:17,000
So what I'm thinking.

2298
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,900
About.

2299
02:04:20,966 --> 02:04:23,366
And then I'm going to try.

2300
02:04:24,566 --> 02:04:26,266
Moving over here a bit and then going for.

2301
02:04:26,266 --> 02:04:28,500
The middle.
Maybe that'll help. Like, shimmy over

2302
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:32,700
oh, god. Why?

2303
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:36,416
They got to make it
so difficult for though.

2304
02:04:38,616 --> 02:04:42,716
Oh, mm

2305
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:44,966
mm mm mm mm.

2306
02:04:46,633 --> 02:04:49,816
Mm Guys, I can't reach the head.

2307
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:53,233
I don't know how many more times
you want me to say I can't reach the head.

2308
02:04:53,266 --> 02:04:54,400
Guys.

2309
02:04:54,566 --> 02:04:56,066
I can't go to the head.

2310
02:04:56,066 --> 02:04:57,950
It cannot go to the head.

2311
02:04:57,950 --> 02:04:59,983
You can't, you know, I can't reach that.

2312
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,633
Have you can reach my head.

2313
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,183
This fucking dog man.

2314
02:05:08,183 --> 02:05:11,366
This fucking dog is causing me
so much emotional distress.

2315
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,483
I need help.

2316
02:05:20,483 --> 02:05:22,816

02:06:19,066 --> 02:06:20,216
Just cooperate. With me.

2330
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:28,916
Oh. What am I doing wrong?

2331
02:06:28,916 --> 02:06:31,550
I feel like I feel like

2332
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:34,916
it hasn't moved.

2333
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:38,033
I feel like it hasn't moved in
like the past 15 minutes.

2334
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,716
And we're just, like, imagining it

2335
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,016
I'm like half of my points

2336
02:06:45,016 --> 02:06:47,400
now that we started off
with since the beginning.

2337
02:06:48,566 --> 02:06:50,366
Oh, God.

2338
02:06:50,783 --> 02:06:52,650
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean to do that.

2339
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:53,366
Oh, God.

2340
02:06:53,366 --> 02:06:54,016
Oops.

2341
02:07:00,016 --> 02:07:01,350
Oh, did I help?

2342
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:04,516
Did that, like, accidentally help

2343
02:07:07,516 --> 02:07:08,900
did that accidentally help it?

2344
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:11,300
I don't know. That
looks like that looks good.

2345
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:14,333
That was kind of good to me.

2346
02:07:16,216 --> 02:07:16,916
No, it didn't.

2347
02:07:16,916 --> 02:07:18,083
It did not.

2348
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:19,216
It did not.

2349
02:07:24,466 --> 02:07:27,000
It's it's.

2350
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,066
It's fine.

2351
02:07:28,066 --> 02:07:30,183
It's fine. Guys. It's fine.

2352
02:07:30,183 --> 02:07:31,533
You know, I

2353
02:07:36,766 --> 02:07:38,816
because God will God will be here soon.

2354
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:43,033
I'm so bad at this.

2355
02:07:43,883 --> 02:07:45,350
Oh, my God, I'm so bad.

2356
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:49,316
You know, I can hear I can hear my son
the back of my head saying

2357
02:07:49,733 --> 02:07:52,166
sorry God survived

2358
02:07:52,783 --> 02:07:55,500
like the entire is just blah.

2359
02:07:56,066 --> 02:07:57,916
Why am I getting so worked up over it?

2360
02:07:57,916 --> 02:08:01,366
Like, just a stupid crane and over him?

2361
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:02,566
Jesus

2362
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:06,683
Christ.

2363
02:08:07,916 --> 02:08:11,066
Oh, if I
go, I don't know where to go for anymore.

2364
02:08:11,183 --> 02:08:14,266
Some people say before the bar
and some people say after the bar.

2365
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:17,300
After they're already after the bar.

2366
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:18,683
Like, right here

2367
02:08:28,016 --> 02:08:29,400
it's giving me the illusion.

2368
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,000
That I'm doing anything at all right now.

2369
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,266
Ah, ah, ah.

2370
02:08:35,633 --> 02:08:39,766
Yeah. Mhm.

2371
02:08:41,183 --> 02:08:42,500
Help!

2372
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:44,966
Help! Help! Help! Help!

2373
02:08:44,966 --> 02:08:47,150
Help! Please, please.
I've been a good boy.

2374
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:48,416
I've been a good boy.

2375
02:08:48,416 --> 02:08:48,950
I've been.

2376
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:51,000
I've been such a good boy.

2377
02:08:52,016 --> 02:08:52,850
Dude, if I.

2378
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,316
If I don't get this.

2379
02:08:55,350 --> 02:08:58,250
By the end of the stream,
I'm going to listen to penis music

2380
02:08:59,300 --> 02:08:59,966
like.

2381
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,416
Like penis type beats for the rest.

2382
02:09:02,416 --> 02:09:03,566
Of the day.

2383
02:09:03,683 --> 02:09:05,983
So even like,
you know, induce even more of

2384
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,800
like a mind break.

2385
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,400
Oh. Shit man.

2386
02:09:14,666 --> 02:09:15,716
Get me out.

2387
02:09:15,716 --> 02:09:17,066
I give me the dog.

2388
02:09:17,066 --> 02:09:21,050
Just give it, give it to me, you give it,
it needs all.

2389
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:22,133
Got it. Let's all go

2390
02:09:24,983 --> 02:09:28,950
what the fuck, man?

2391
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:32,783
Remember, if I just.

2392
02:09:32,783 --> 02:09:36,416
Try to it there,
I just keep doing what I did before.

2393
02:09:36,683 --> 02:09:38,366
That seems like.

2394
02:09:39,150 --> 02:09:40,283
It's. Like your work.

2395
02:09:40,283 --> 02:09:43,350
Just, like,
grab the middle and just keep pulling,

2396
02:09:45,266 --> 02:09:47,000
like, right here and there.

2397
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:47,416
Like help.

2398
02:09:47,416 --> 02:09:47,783
Like.

2399
02:09:55,066 --> 02:09:55,516
That.

2400
02:09:55,516 --> 02:09:57,533
It doesn't do anything.

2401
02:09:57,533 --> 02:09:59,600
It doesn't do anything.

2402
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:02,350
It doesn't do anything. Oh.

2403
02:10:03,450 --> 02:10:08,266
I thought.

2404
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,483
You know,

2405
02:10:12,116 --> 02:10:14,300
this is a good time to, ah.

2406
02:10:15,066 --> 02:10:16,583
To show you guys something, though.

2407
02:10:16,583 --> 02:10:17,666
I think

2408
02:10:19,550 --> 02:10:21,016
it's the middle of the stream.

2409
02:10:21,016 --> 02:10:25,516
I think I think right now
we can take a small moments

2410
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,300
to, ah,

2411
02:10:28,516 --> 02:10:31,916
so I can show people like a little sneak
peek.

2412
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:34,733

2413
02:10:37,883 --> 02:10:38,966
the sobs.

2414
02:10:38,966 --> 02:10:39,683
Right.

2415
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,533
The Irish showed like the sobs by y'all.

2416
02:10:42,533 --> 02:10:45,466
We're getting new emotes soon, so hold on.

02:10:45,466 --> 02:10:46,150

It's so fucking adorable.
OK, I'll actually hold on.

2429
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:11,016
We're losing time. We're losing time.

02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:27,416
You're getting nowhere.

I've gone so far to lose it all.

2458
02:13:09,266 --> 02:13:11,316
In the end, it's.

Struggle right now. It's. This is so sad.

What the fuck is out?

2471
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,866
The fuck do I do about with the Buddha?

2472
02:13:48,866 --> 02:13:51,950

2474
02:13:56,333 --> 02:13:58,433
I I think I don't know.

2475
02:13:58,433 --> 02:13:59,333
I think,

2476
02:14:00,083 --> 02:14:01,316
I don't think that's the thing.

2477
02:14:01,316 --> 02:14:03,366
I don't fucking think her dream the thing.

2478
02:14:03,383 --> 02:14:05,000
Ah, it's like. Well, this,

2479
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,133
this is I press this button.

2480
02:14:07,133 --> 02:14:10,616
Well, if I press this button, does it help

2481
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:17,066
I don't know what this button
is supposed to do.

2482
02:14:18,533 --> 02:14:20,800
Does anybody know what this button
is supposed to do?

2483
02:14:20,816 --> 02:14:22,400
Because, like, it's just sitting here

2484
02:14:29,783 --> 02:14:33,016
no. OK, ok, ok. OK.

2485
02:14:35,066 --> 02:14:36,316
Chi Chi.

2486
02:14:36,316 --> 02:14:36,916
Chi Chi.

2487
02:14:38,783 --> 02:14:40,700
Continue to clamp his arse.

2488
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:41,866
OK, you know what?

2489
02:14:41,866 --> 02:14:43,283
I will continue to clamp his arse.

2490
02:14:43,283 --> 02:14:45,800
Then all that.

2491
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:01,216
I cannot grab it from the head.

2492
02:15:01,216 --> 02:15:03,616
I've said it like 10,000 times now.

2493
02:15:03,866 --> 02:15:05,516
It is impossible for me.

2494
02:15:05,516 --> 02:15:07,516
The crane doesn't go. Back that far.

2495
02:15:07,766 --> 02:15:08,966
You guys see?

2496
02:15:08,966 --> 02:15:09,650
It does not.

2497
02:15:09,650 --> 02:15:11,550
Go back that far, all right?

2498
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:14,700
It doesn't. If you continue to say.

2499
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:18,750
That, I will probably make my mods bonk
you so much out.

2500
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,266
It just doesn't do it.

2501
02:15:21,266 --> 02:15:22,550
I don't know why it's mean.

2502
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:24,683
It doesn't
let me go back that far. It's sad.

2503
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:33,350
He really doesn't want me to cry.

2504
02:15:34,666 --> 02:15:37,400
I just i someone I, I don't know.

I don't have God anymore.

2520
02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:29,566
God isn't here.

2521
02:16:37,550 --> 02:16:38,250
I'm so bad.

2522
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:38,833
I suck.

2523
02:16:38,833 --> 02:16:41,000
I suck at these games.

2524
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:43,200
Oh, no.

02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,600
Oh, no, no, no.

2526
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:45,500
This is painful.

02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:48,016
This is so painful. Guys.

2528
02:16:48,833 --> 02:16:49,800
I'm at a loss.

2529
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,800
I'm really lost right now.

2530
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:55,550
Like, I feel like we've tried everything
and nothing's

2531
02:16:55,550 --> 02:16:56,816
been working

2532
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:01,883
is because he's such a big boy.

2533
02:17:01,883 --> 02:17:03,150
He's such a big boy.

2534
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:05,833
He's such a big boy.
I can't see much about it.

2535
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:08,566
I feel like his

2536
02:17:08,566 --> 02:17:11,516
front half is too far in.

2537
02:17:13,966 --> 02:17:16,616
I could.

2538
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:23,416
I try for, like, around this spot

2539
02:17:23,416 --> 02:17:26,366
and see what we'll see what happens

2540
02:17:31,166 --> 02:17:31,616
nothing.

2541
02:17:31,616 --> 02:17:33,500
Happens, nothing.

2542
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,433

2545
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,933
I wonder how is it anybody else?

2546
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,450
Is there anybody else
that has done this before?

2547
02:17:47,450 --> 02:17:50,866
And it's like, works for them
as far as everybody ever succeeded

2548
02:17:50,866 --> 02:17:51,900

2685
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:29,750
I was about to say Kung Fu Panda. What

2686
02:26:30,166 --> 02:26:31,800
no, that's not Kung Fu Panda.

2687
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:34,516
Ah, mm.

2688
02:26:35,183 --> 02:26:36,416
There's a hamster.

2689
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:38,183
An alien. What?

2690
02:26:38,183 --> 02:26:40,050
There's a fucking zoo. No morphine here.

2691
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:43,033
Holy shit. I love Xena morphs

2692
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:45,316
mm. What else?

2693
02:26:45,316 --> 02:26:47,550
I'll see they got here.

2694
02:26:47,866 --> 02:26:51,300
Some one look kind of funny.

2695
02:26:52,066 --> 02:26:53,416
Yeah, a lot of them look kind of funny.

2696
02:26:53,416 --> 02:26:59,266
Are a lively sushi backpack, and

2697
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:02,933
that's a joy story.

2698
02:27:03,466 --> 02:27:05,866
You got a friend in me.

2699
02:27:06,716 --> 02:27:07,616
All right.

2700
02:27:08,866 --> 02:27:09,650
Who's this. Guy?

2701
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:11,666
Oh, isn't this Inu Maki?

2702
02:27:11,666 --> 02:27:12,500
Oh, I love it.

2703
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:12,900
I love you.

2704
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:15,750
The monkey is really cool.

2705
02:27:16,466 --> 02:27:18,983
Uh, what else is there?

2706
02:27:18,983 --> 02:27:19,733
I don't know.

2707
02:27:22,816 --> 02:27:23,100
All these

2708
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:26,116
ones round here really strike my,
ah, my interest

2709
02:27:28,666 --> 02:27:30,300
I go back up to the top.

2710
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:30,566
Yeah.

2711
02:27:30,566 --> 02:27:32,850
The only thing I saw that kind of

2712
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:36,500
I kind of wanted to go out
was that saw the Mansa, another stingray.

2713
02:27:36,616 --> 02:27:38,716
There's also this big fucking carrot.

2714
02:27:38,716 --> 02:27:42,200
And was this a cushion?

2715
02:27:42,450 --> 02:27:43,216
An otter?

2716
02:27:43,216 --> 02:27:44,600
Let me take. A look at this one.

2717
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,800
What's here?

2718
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:53,066
What the fuck is this? Huh?

2719
02:27:54,716 --> 02:27:59,016
Is this one possible um.

2720
02:27:59,783 --> 02:28:00,766
It looks cute.

2721
02:28:00,766 --> 02:28:01,950
Why? I don't know.

2722
02:28:01,950 --> 02:28:03,083
All go, like, shove.

2723
02:28:03,083 --> 02:28:05,483
My shove my fist. Inside it.

2724
02:28:05,483 --> 02:28:07,016
It's a hand warmer.

2725
02:28:07,016 --> 02:28:10,966
Oh, it's a hand warmer. OK,

2726
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:16,316
I know the hole looks kind of saucy.

2727
02:28:16,850 --> 02:28:19,800
The hole looks kind of sassy, bro.

2728
02:28:22,516 --> 02:28:23,366
All right,

2729
02:28:23,366 --> 02:28:27,616
I'm gonna
I might come back to that one bites.

2730
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:31,016
What about this who are you?

2731
02:28:31,016 --> 02:28:33,000
You look really cute.

2732
02:28:37,133 --> 02:28:39,850
What kind of a game is this?

2733
02:28:39,850 --> 02:28:42,066
A long way.

2734
02:28:42,383 --> 02:28:43,216
How is this one work?

2735
02:28:43,216 --> 02:28:44,400
Do you guys know how.

2736
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,366
What I'm supposed to do here?

2737
02:28:46,366 --> 02:28:48,616
Am I supposed to knock the
the block into the

2738
02:28:48,866 --> 02:28:50,416
into the hole?

2739
02:28:59,650 --> 02:29:00,050
Yeah.

2740
02:29:00,916 --> 02:29:01,550
She's cute.

2741
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:03,600
Yeah, she's really cute.

2742
02:29:05,250 --> 02:29:06,766
I'm lucky you are, but you look cute.

2743
02:29:06,766 --> 02:29:09,750
18 centimetres. How big is that?

2744
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:11,450
That's glued.

2745
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:12,050
That's a knock.

2746
02:29:12,050 --> 02:29:15,416
Both of them in or just one of them in

2747
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:20,400
it is on.

2748
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,700
Also skim my big.

2749
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,616
OK, that's not big.

2750
02:29:27,383 --> 02:29:29,966
OK, load out this one.

2751
02:29:29,966 --> 02:29:31,550
There's like two of them.

2752
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:34,700
Was this one look like huh?

2753
02:29:41,550 --> 02:29:42,683
What is happening.

2754
02:29:42,683 --> 02:29:43,583
Here?

2755
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:49,350
Oh, what.

2756
02:29:49,950 --> 02:29:53,600
We went off and did a cockney

2757
02:29:55,066 --> 02:29:57,500
it says something in Japanese at the top.

2758
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:59,783
I don't think. All it's
because there's always too many people.

2759
02:29:59,783 --> 02:30:00,583
In line. I think

2760
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:05,000
there's are a lot of people in line,
so I can't get inside.

2761
02:30:05,116 --> 02:30:08,566
I had to push
pull the tag off of the hook how.

2762
02:30:08,716 --> 02:30:10,883
I seems so difficult

2763
02:30:13,616 --> 02:30:16,433
what the heck

2764
02:30:21,683 --> 02:30:24,150
this dude's trying, but it looks so hard.

2765
02:30:26,033 --> 02:30:29,333
How is that how's that possible?

2766
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:31,916
Yeah, this one looks like a scale

2767
02:30:32,666 --> 02:30:33,250
I can't.

2768
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:36,150
Yeah, I can jump into this one.

2769
02:30:37,883 --> 02:30:38,333
Oh, yeah.

2770
02:30:38,333 --> 02:30:40,350
To knock it off of the platform.

2771
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:41,516
But it was like shaking.

2772
02:30:41,516 --> 02:30:42,300
All over the place.

2773
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:45,116
Still like that on

2774
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:46,066
yeah.

2775
02:30:46,066 --> 02:30:47,933
It's stuck to the platform.

2776
02:30:47,933 --> 02:30:50,133
There's no way

2777
02:30:52,966 --> 02:30:55,350
that that looks like
it's stuck to the platform.

2778
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:56,750
Well, you're getting scammed.

2779
02:30:56,750 --> 02:31:00,150
Sorry. No, not.

2780
02:31:00,150 --> 02:31:01,100
Not that

2781
02:31:04,583 --> 02:31:06,316
I want to take a look at Lancer

2782
02:31:06,316 --> 02:31:08,516
and see what it looks like. Oh.

2783
02:31:10,916 --> 02:31:12,450
What's the Lancer figurine look like?

2784
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,300
Uh hmm.

2785
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:20,683
I like Lancer, but

2786
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:24,383
I'm not sure

2787
02:31:24,383 --> 02:31:26,783
I'm really see. Mm.

2788
02:31:27,083 --> 02:31:30,466
Maybe I should just settle for the
for the stingray.

2789
02:31:30,616 --> 02:31:31,283
Right.

2790
02:31:31,283 --> 02:31:31,966
Stingray?

2791
02:31:31,966 --> 02:31:35,033
Where's a stingray? I'll go back to you.

2792
02:31:35,033 --> 02:31:37,433
Hey, there you are.

2793
02:31:41,116 --> 02:31:43,283
Oh, these are a bunch of people in line
for the stingray.

2794
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:48,683
Why yeah.

2795
02:31:48,683 --> 02:31:51,050
This one doesn't
want so bad to get to grab, right

2796
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,616
as I get the dog. I did get the dog.

2797
02:31:54,716 --> 02:31:56,333
I got my dog.

2798
02:32:02,116 --> 02:32:03,316
It's going to take an eternity.

2799
02:32:03,316 --> 02:32:07,583
This one. OK?

2800
02:32:07,916 --> 02:32:08,400
This guy.

2801
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,850
Looks really hard to get.

2802
02:32:20,116 --> 02:32:20,333
Yeah.

2803
02:32:20,333 --> 02:32:22,100
How are how are you supposed.

2804
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:24,800
To get this one in the whole

2805
02:32:26,933 --> 02:32:27,716
we haven't named the dog.

2806
02:32:27,716 --> 02:32:31,316
Oh, I think we decide to name him
Schlegel.

2807
02:32:31,766 --> 02:32:34,016
Yeah, I think she's gonna
be a good name for the dog.

2808
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,600
Yeah,

2809
02:32:36,416 --> 02:32:38,333
well, maybe she'll go

2810
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:45,916
the keys.

2811
02:32:45,916 --> 02:32:46,400
Yeah.

2812
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:49,550
I don't know about this one, y'all,
because there's are people

2813
02:32:49,550 --> 02:32:52,916
waiting in line, and it doesn't look like
he's going to get anywhere

2814
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,016
with this

2815
02:33:03,316 --> 02:33:03,883
he's.

2816
02:33:04,466 --> 02:33:05,783
He can't feel. Anything.

2817
02:33:05,783 --> 02:33:08,250
I think we just.

2818
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:11,533
Since there's are a lot of people waiting,
I don't think it's a good idea

2819
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:12,916
to go for that.

2820
02:33:12,916 --> 02:33:16,216
Um. Dude, hold on a second.

2821
02:33:16,216 --> 02:33:18,166
There's so many ones for Lance.

2822
02:33:18,166 --> 02:33:21,116
I really want to try for this one.

2823
02:33:24,266 --> 02:33:25,816
But there's are, like, a few people.

2824
02:33:25,816 --> 02:33:27,383
Waiting in line

2825
02:33:29,866 --> 02:33:30,316
yeah.

2826
02:33:30,316 --> 02:33:31,283
I can't join this.

2827
02:33:31,283 --> 02:33:33,300
Nor I want.

2828
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:36,533
I want to get in here, please. Eggplant.

2829
02:33:36,533 --> 02:33:38,266
There is an eggplant.

2830
02:33:41,666 --> 02:33:43,283
There's an eggplant.

2831
02:33:43,283 --> 02:33:46,050
What brah?

2832
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:49,133
It's taped.

2833
02:33:49,133 --> 02:33:51,116
What do you mean, it's taped?

2834
02:33:52,133 --> 02:33:52,350
Yeah.

2835
02:33:52,350 --> 02:33:54,866
What is this guy doing here? Uh.

2836
02:33:57,116 --> 02:33:58,050
I don't know if

2837
02:33:58,050 --> 02:33:59,833
this one feels kind of

2838
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:03,383
all he has to do is just.

2839
02:34:03,383 --> 02:34:04,466
Get inside the hole, right?

2840
02:34:04,466 --> 02:34:05,516
Does he have to get both of them or.

2841
02:34:05,516 --> 02:34:06,950
Just one of them?

2842
02:34:09,433 --> 02:34:11,666
It looks like
he has only got one of them, right?

2843
02:34:11,666 --> 02:34:14,066
I mean, it just says one,

2844
02:34:14,066 --> 02:34:16,350
so I feel like it's kind of cruel,

2845
02:34:16,583 --> 02:34:18,916
so I wanted to try and get
both inside the hole.

2846
02:34:19,050 --> 02:34:20,333
Both of them.

2847
02:34:20,333 --> 02:34:21,500
Really?

2848
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,216
There's no way.

2849
02:34:22,216 --> 02:34:24,650
It's just it has to be only one.

2850
02:34:24,650 --> 02:34:25,500
Right?

2851
02:34:32,866 --> 02:34:35,133
Woah.

2852
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:41,116
Oh, shit.

2853
02:34:41,116 --> 02:34:43,133
Did you see that, guys?

2854
02:34:43,133 --> 02:34:45,000
Oh, my God.

2855
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:48,050
He actually picked it out off
the of the crane

2856
02:34:51,083 --> 02:34:53,333
but it's stuck there now.

2857
02:34:53,333 --> 02:34:55,616
I don't know. I think.

2858
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:57,050
I don't know
if he's going to be able to get it.

2859
02:34:58,466 --> 02:35:00,450
Holy fuck.

2860
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:04,100
That's funny.

2861
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:06,016
That's really funny.

2862
02:35:08,783 --> 02:35:10,433
Oh, man, I wanted this so bad.

2863
02:35:10,433 --> 02:35:14,350
I really want to try mhm.

2864
02:35:14,966 --> 02:35:16,950
What is he going to do here?

2865
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:24,000
Oh, sorry, buddy.

2866
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,150
Maybe,
you know, maybe our staff can come in

2867
02:35:27,150 --> 02:35:30,833
and help them fill all the.

2868
02:35:30,833 --> 02:35:33,616
Are you talking about this eggplant
right here?

2869
02:35:33,616 --> 02:35:35,250
Yeah, there's an eggplant right there.

2870
02:35:35,250 --> 02:35:37,183
And then what else?

2871
02:35:37,183 --> 02:35:37,733
There's

2872
02:35:40,283 --> 02:35:41,416
gotta

2873
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:44,033
your bubble boy.

2874
02:35:44,033 --> 02:35:44,850
I don't. Know.

2875
02:35:44,850 --> 02:35:46,216
I don't know.

2876
02:35:48,466 --> 02:35:49,066
Who's this guy?

2877
02:35:49,066 --> 02:35:50,900
Oh, this the do from Tokyo or Avengers.

2878
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:52,283
I like that dude

2879
02:35:53,250 --> 02:35:54,750
glass. It looks like a candle.

2880
02:35:54,750 --> 02:35:56,250
I mean, looks like a candle.

2881
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:58,516
And I just got another dog hole on.

2882
02:35:58,616 --> 02:36:01,316
Let's see what our other current person
is doing with this.

2883
02:36:01,433 --> 02:36:03,500
Yeah, yeah. Look at that. Look at. That.

2884
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:06,766
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

2885
02:36:10,233 --> 02:36:10,766
We were.

2886
02:36:10,766 --> 02:36:12,450
We were
gone for like. 20 minutes from that.

2887
02:36:12,450 --> 02:36:14,550
And they didn't do,
they didn't make any progress.

2888
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:17,066
That one Sox roll

2889
02:36:17,066 --> 02:36:19,366
it looks so difficult to get the

2890
02:36:20,566 --> 02:36:22,433
let's get the dog go

2891
02:36:24,766 --> 02:36:28,966
Oh, no,

2892
02:36:28,966 --> 02:36:33,816
I can't join this one. Mm.

2893
02:36:37,916 --> 02:36:40,766
Maybe we can try this game again.

2894
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:42,300
Yeah. Scotty,

2895
02:36:43,766 --> 02:36:45,866
but no, it's not, it's not a cluster.

2896
02:36:45,866 --> 02:36:48,316
It's not, it's just the Lancer

2897
02:36:50,183 --> 02:36:50,550
Yeah.

2898
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:53,100
This one looks bigger
than the rim, though.

2899
02:36:54,683 --> 02:36:55,500
It looks a lot.

2900
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:57,983
Ah, she looks a lot bigger than rim.

2901
02:36:57,983 --> 02:36:59,900
The box that is

2902
02:37:01,050 --> 02:37:04,400
so might be a little bit more difficult

2903
02:37:04,666 --> 02:37:13,583
mm or up here.

2904
02:37:15,083 --> 02:37:16,466
No one's doing this one.

2905
02:37:16,466 --> 02:37:18,450
Wait, hold on. No one's doing this.

2906
02:37:18,450 --> 02:37:20,600
What do I do here? What?
What am I supposed to do here?

2907
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:22,616
Someone explain.
Somebody tell me. Tell me.

2908
02:37:22,616 --> 02:37:23,650
Oh, oh.

2909
02:37:28,316 --> 02:37:29,266
I'm in.

2910
02:37:30,083 --> 02:37:30,916
I'm in.

2911
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:33,683
Oh, my God, I'm in.

2912
02:37:33,683 --> 02:37:34,816
OK, ok.

2913
02:37:34,816 --> 02:37:37,166
OK, ok.

2914
02:37:43,050 --> 02:37:45,683
Knock the card off.

2915
02:37:48,683 --> 02:37:50,216
The blue to get the card out.

2916
02:37:50,216 --> 02:37:51,416
I just have to get the card out.

2917
02:37:51,416 --> 02:37:52,133
Really?

2918
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:58,400
Quick

2919
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:06,700
that doesn't look too bad.

2920
02:38:06,700 --> 02:38:07,816
Was it

2921
02:38:18,016 --> 02:38:19,200
oh, wait, wait.

2922
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:21,450
Well,
hold up, hold on, hold on, hold on. What?

2923
02:38:21,616 --> 02:38:22,550
What was that?

2924
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:24,233
Did you see that?

2925
02:38:25,283 --> 02:38:26,666
Chi Chi.

2926
02:38:26,666 --> 02:38:28,850
Chi Chi alone?

2927
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:29,483
I have an idea.

2928
02:38:29,483 --> 02:38:31,216
I have. I have an idea.

2929
02:38:31,216 --> 02:38:32,716
I have an idea.

2930
02:38:34,666 --> 02:38:35,433
I have an idea.

2931
02:38:35,433 --> 02:38:37,283
Just trust me, ok?

2932
02:38:37,283 --> 02:38:37,883
Just trust me.

2933
02:38:37,883 --> 02:38:39,450
Oh, I'm stupid.

2934
02:38:39,450 --> 02:38:42,350
I'm stupid. I'm stupid. I'm stupid.
I went too far. I went too far.

2935
02:38:42,383 --> 02:38:43,516
Oh, God.

2936
02:38:48,383 --> 02:38:48,983
Yeah, I'm trying to.

2937
02:38:48,983 --> 02:38:49,766
Pull the card.

2938
02:38:49,766 --> 02:38:51,083
I'm trying to pull the card right now.

2939
02:38:51,083 --> 02:38:53,416
But it looks so damn

2940
02:38:54,383 --> 02:38:56,116
I've never seen a crying game.

2941
02:38:56,116 --> 02:38:59,883
Like this one. Put

2942
02:39:04,966 --> 02:39:05,900
diverse things on to you.

2943
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:07,700
This one really

2944
02:39:12,450 --> 02:39:15,716
quite low.

2945
02:39:16,133 --> 02:39:18,766
What the hell

2946
02:39:19,433 --> 02:39:22,366
how? It's not moving.

2947
02:39:22,366 --> 02:39:24,400
This one's not moving.

2948
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:26,566
Why is it not moving?

2949
02:39:26,566 --> 02:39:27,716
Hello?

2950
02:39:32,216 --> 02:39:34,500
What is that sign?

2951
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:38,450
Say, this is my translate.

2952
02:39:40,916 --> 02:39:43,066
Oh, my God,

2953
02:39:43,350 --> 02:39:44,416
brah.

2954
02:39:48,716 --> 02:39:51,916
Do you think if I keep at it
stuff that God will show up again?

2955
02:39:51,916 --> 02:39:52,766
I don't know, I yeah.

2956
02:39:52,766 --> 02:39:55,016
I shouldn't push my luck.
See my. Should I?

2957
02:39:55,016 --> 02:39:57,033
I I feel like I really shouldn't
push my luck

2958
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:58,600
with God.

2959
02:40:08,300 --> 02:40:08,866
Oh, my.

2960
02:40:08,866 --> 02:40:09,450
Goodness.

2961
02:40:09,450 --> 02:40:11,466
When is it coming loose?

2962
02:40:11,483 --> 02:40:13,816
It feels like it's getting looser.

2963
02:40:13,816 --> 02:40:17,366
It looks like it's getting looser,
doesn't it?

2964
02:40:17,816 --> 02:40:18,800
It's shaking a lot.

2965
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:19,616
Is shaking a lot.

2966
02:40:19,616 --> 02:40:20,716
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2967
02:40:20,716 --> 02:40:23,000
Maybe, maybe, maybe I only got.

2968
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,050
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2969
02:40:24,050 --> 02:40:27,050
I feel like it's
that's at his victory party.

2970
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:27,900
I'd say that.

2971
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:33,616
OK. Or maybe I'm under.

2972
02:40:33,616 --> 02:40:36,150
Some mad culpa on the gun.

2973
02:40:40,966 --> 02:40:44,333
No, it's not going out.

2974
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:49,433
Y'all.

2975
02:40:49,433 --> 02:40:53,266
I think I just

2976
02:40:56,450 --> 02:40:57,350
dropped my check again.

2977
02:40:57,350 --> 02:40:58,066
What's my trick?

2978
02:40:58,066 --> 02:40:59,750
I don't have a trick.

2979
02:41:05,550 --> 02:41:06,800
All I'll increase.

2980
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:07,100
I will.

2981
02:41:07,100 --> 02:41:09,800
Using CP while. Playing
will increase arm strength.

2982
02:41:09,833 --> 02:41:11,100
What will increase the.

2983
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:12,983
Screen arm strength?

2984
02:41:12,983 --> 02:41:14,716
Is that what it said?

2985
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,083
That sounds stupid.

2986
02:41:16,083 --> 02:41:21,933
Could it.

2987
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:23,066
OK, ok.

2988
02:41:23,066 --> 02:41:25,466
OK, ok. OK.

2989
02:41:30,016 --> 02:41:33,266
Why is it not moving at all?

2990
02:41:34,816 --> 02:41:36,650
Why is it not moving?

2991
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:37,200
It's not.

2992
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:39,466
It's not going anywhere.

2993
02:41:46,583 --> 02:41:48,466
Oh, my God.

2994
02:41:48,466 --> 02:41:49,766
Try the left side.

2995
02:41:49,766 --> 02:41:51,000
Really? Try the left side.

2996
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,400
Sure, I'll try the left side.

2997
02:41:55,216 --> 02:41:56,366
Right.

2998
02:41:59,516 --> 02:42:01,066
This is so sad.

2999
02:42:06,866 --> 02:42:07,766
Oh, wait.

3000
02:42:07,766 --> 02:42:09,566
No, no, no, no.

3001
02:42:09,566 --> 02:42:12,300
And move it. Move it. Fucking move.
You can't lie to me.

3002
02:42:12,316 --> 02:42:14,416
You can't lie to me.
They're in fucking move there.

3003
02:42:14,516 --> 02:42:16,316
I saw it with my own eyes. My own.

3004
02:42:16,316 --> 02:42:17,416
I saw that shit.

3005
02:42:17,416 --> 02:42:20,116
Dude, dude,
I think we can do it. Oh, my God.

3006
02:42:20,116 --> 02:42:21,900
I stumbled upon a gold mine.

3007
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:23,483
Yo, it's possible.

3008
02:42:23,483 --> 02:42:25,583
It is so possible. What?

3009
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,500
Or maybe that's how they get you.

3010
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:30,533
Don't. Sound so crazy.

3011
02:42:30,533 --> 02:42:40,800
I it's getting loose.

3012
02:42:40,916 --> 02:42:41,633
Oh, my God.

3013
02:42:41,633 --> 02:42:44,966
Guys, guys, guys, it's getting loose.

3014
02:42:45,766 --> 02:42:47,816
Oh, my God. It's getting looser.
And looser.

3015
02:42:47,816 --> 02:42:49,250
Holy shit.

3016
02:42:52,066 --> 02:42:52,916
We can do it.

3017
02:42:52,916 --> 02:42:55,516
Oh, my God. This is crazy.

3018
02:42:55,516 --> 02:42:56,583
That's crazy day.

3019
02:42:56,583 --> 02:43:03,166
Oh, ha ha ha

3020
02:43:06,616 --> 02:43:07,016
Mm hmm.

3021
02:43:07,016 --> 02:43:09,300
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3022
02:43:12,650 --> 02:43:14,850
It's getting so loose right now.

3023
02:43:15,016 --> 02:43:16,733
Holy shit.

3024
02:43:16,733 --> 02:43:18,350
Oh, my God.

3025
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:19,950
Oh, oh.

3026
02:43:20,516 --> 02:43:21,566
Oh, yeah, baby.

3027
02:43:21,566 --> 02:43:24,750
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh.

3028
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:25,966
It's there.

3029
02:43:25,966 --> 02:43:28,483
The box is, like, wiggling
back and forth. It's kind of helping out.

3030
02:43:28,516 --> 02:43:29,416
Get loose still.

3031
02:43:29,416 --> 02:43:32,333
I like that. Wow.

3032
02:43:35,416 --> 02:43:38,066
Let's try the other side now.

3033
02:43:38,416 --> 02:43:39,983
Maybe they'll help.

3034
02:43:43,816 --> 02:43:45,833
Why am I so excited over this?

3035
02:43:45,833 --> 02:43:47,516
This is addictive.

3036
02:43:51,383 --> 02:43:55,066
Did I just push it further back in?

3037
02:43:55,066 --> 02:43:55,733
I hope not.

3038
02:43:58,583 --> 02:44:00,066
I can't tell what I just did there.

3039
02:44:00,066 --> 02:44:04,616
I push it further back in
or I get more loose, and I don't know

3040
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:06,900
now it's still coming out.

3041
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:07,650
Is this still coming out?

3042
02:44:07,650 --> 02:44:09,383
I'm not sure.

3043
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:12,983
Stay lofts.

3044
02:44:12,983 --> 02:44:16,100
Keep it on the plus side. Oh.

3045
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:17,716
Do what do I like?

3046
02:44:17,716 --> 02:44:20,216
Do I use the left hook
or do I use the right hook?

3047
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:21,200
Original plan.

3048
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:21,800
Original plan.

3049
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:23,866
OK, I'll kill it. Six Original plan.

3050
02:44:23,866 --> 02:44:25,016
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

3051
02:44:25,016 --> 02:44:26,033
I like that.

3052
02:44:32,666 --> 02:44:33,200
Oh, my God.

3053
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:34,166
That's perfect.

3054
02:44:34,166 --> 02:44:36,350
That's so good shot. Boy, you're so sexy.

3055
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:37,466
Holy fuck.

3056
02:44:37,466 --> 02:44:43,800
Are it's.

3057
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:45,800
Giving me. It's giving me so much hope.

3058
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,066
And for what?

3059
02:44:47,416 --> 02:44:51,083
It's much fucking hope.

3060
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:53,150
OK, I'll try it.

3061
02:44:53,150 --> 02:44:53,966
I'll try the left.

3062
02:44:53,966 --> 02:44:57,333
No. Put

3063
02:45:04,833 --> 02:45:06,350
oh, no, I fucked up.

3064
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:07,850
I didn't go further in and off.

3065
02:45:07,850 --> 02:45:09,566
OK, it's fine. It's fine.

3066
02:45:12,116 --> 02:45:13,916
I think we can get it.

3067
02:45:13,916 --> 02:45:15,616
Before we hit 100,000.

3068
02:45:15,616 --> 02:45:19,466
Keep ok.

3069
02:45:20,516 --> 02:45:22,316
Well, this is so thrilling.

3070
02:45:22,316 --> 02:45:23,850
Why is this so exciting then?

3071
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:26,216
God, it should not be this exciting.

3072
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,350
OK, go, go, go, go.

3073
02:45:34,350 --> 02:45:35,783
Come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go.

3074
02:45:35,783 --> 02:45:37,950
Yes. No.

3075
02:45:37,950 --> 02:45:40,200
No, I didn't go further back
enough. OK, ok.

3076
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:42,916
I got to go a little bit more back
a little bit more back.

3077
02:45:44,183 --> 02:45:44,866
Be a little bit more.

3078
02:45:44,866 --> 02:45:47,700
Generous of the ah, the distance.

3079
02:45:49,616 --> 02:45:52,016
Oh, well.

3080
02:45:53,150 --> 02:45:55,633
What am I getting all. Put.

3081
02:45:56,033 --> 02:45:59,300
It sore after yo servant if you know

3082
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:01,933
couscous. Ah

3083
02:46:02,566 --> 02:46:04,316
that's how it's pronounced

3084
02:46:11,850 --> 02:46:12,233
bark.

3085
02:46:12,233 --> 02:46:14,300
No I don't think that's good.
I don't know.

3086
02:46:14,416 --> 02:46:16,883
I pushed it back in

3087
02:46:18,916 --> 02:46:20,400
I don't think that's a good idea.

3088
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,366
I don't think that's a good idea.

3089
02:46:22,366 --> 02:46:24,533
I'm just going to stick
to my original plan.

3090
02:46:24,533 --> 02:46:26,266
Otherwise I'm going to. Troll myself.

3091
02:46:30,566 --> 02:46:31,400
Yeah.

3092
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:40,283
The other side did a lot better.

3093
02:46:40,550 --> 02:46:42,050
In my opinion.

3094
02:46:43,733 --> 02:46:45,800
Yeah, that got more loose.

3095
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:47,066
I just got to keep going at it.

3096
02:46:47,066 --> 02:46:48,716
I just got to keep going at that side.

3097
02:46:48,716 --> 02:46:50,750
Right. Are you?

3098
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:51,300
Mm hmm.

3099
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:51,900
Mm hmm.

3100
02:46:59,116 --> 02:47:01,250
While it's actually not a scam,
can you believe it?

3101
02:47:01,466 --> 02:47:04,350
It's actually not a fucking scam.

3102
02:47:06,583 --> 02:47:08,050
Well, he's enough

3103
02:47:09,416 --> 02:47:10,366
all that was not enough.

3104
02:47:10,366 --> 02:47:13,200
I look stupid, OK? Ah, cut it.

3105
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:14,400
Cut it out of it.

3106
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:15,466
Cut the cap out.

3107
02:47:15,466 --> 02:47:16,366
All the either

3108
02:47:18,266 --> 02:47:20,516
don't look at me. Shut

3109
02:47:24,983 --> 02:47:26,116
I don't fucking look at me.

3110
02:47:26,116 --> 02:47:28,133
Don't give me what I want
is a little embarrassing.

3111
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,266
I can't lie.

3112
02:47:34,966 --> 02:47:36,500
I fuck up again.

3113
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,550
I fucked up again.

3114
02:47:37,550 --> 02:47:40,816
No, ah, my CPR.

3115
02:47:49,350 --> 02:47:52,650
Maybe maybe staff will bless me

3116
02:47:52,650 --> 02:47:55,583
God will bless me with his
with his love and grace again.

3117
02:48:10,516 --> 02:48:11,600
It's getting there.

3118
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,816
I can I can tell it's
kind of getting there, though.

3119
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:16,200
Maybe I should go for the further back
a bit.

3120
02:48:16,766 --> 02:48:17,933
It's like slipping out.

3121
02:48:17,933 --> 02:48:21,000
You see that
it's slowly slipping out. God,

3122
02:48:23,850 --> 02:48:24,616
oh, no, no, no.

3123
02:48:24,616 --> 02:48:25,466
I messed up. I messed up.

3124
02:48:25,466 --> 02:48:27,150
I didn't mean the press that I fucked up

3125
02:48:27,150 --> 02:48:29,300
I fucked up, I fucked up
I fucked up I fucked up.

3126
02:48:31,133 --> 02:48:32,633
Fucked up

3127
02:48:34,966 --> 02:48:36,750
I look stupid I looked.

3128
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:38,783
So stupid

3129
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,400
I trusted some soon.

3130
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:52,100
All right, let's go again.

3131
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:53,116
Go again.

3132
02:48:54,566 --> 02:48:55,816
OK, that's a good spot.

3133
02:48:55,816 --> 02:48:57,450
That's a good spot.

3134
02:48:59,966 --> 02:49:01,050
Right there.

3135
02:49:01,150 --> 02:49:02,383
Right there,

3136
02:49:02,966 --> 02:49:05,400
right there, right there, right there.

3137
02:49:06,983 --> 02:49:11,100
Oh. Oh, yo, yo.

3138
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:15,050
There's on this one.

3139
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:16,500
It's looking. It's looking good.

3140
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:18,716
It's looking really good.

3141
02:49:21,616 --> 02:49:23,216
Maybe this is the one.

3142
02:49:23,216 --> 02:49:25,433
Maybe this one's the one. Oh, man,

3143
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:27,983
I think, I think we can.

3144
02:49:27,983 --> 02:49:30,416
I think we can get it off.

3145
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:45,233
All your subjects, he's.

3146
02:49:45,616 --> 02:49:47,100
Oh, my God, you're such a tease.

3147
02:49:47,100 --> 02:49:49,366
OK, maybe. I mean, maybe I can go.

3148
02:49:49,366 --> 02:49:53,266
You know,
maybe I can go for the left side now.

3149
02:49:53,633 --> 02:49:54,933
I don't know.

3150
02:49:55,216 --> 02:49:56,450
What should I do here?

3151
02:49:56,450 --> 02:50:00,616
Maybe I should pull up the R at the part
that's closer to me.

3152
02:50:00,616 --> 02:50:02,550
I'm not sure, man.

3153
02:50:04,916 --> 02:50:09,300
Mm mm mm mm mm mm.

3154
02:50:13,066 --> 02:50:22,200
Or oh, no.

3155
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:23,816
I think. Go further enough, OK?

3156
02:50:23,816 --> 02:50:24,200
It's fine.

3157
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:27,183
It's fine. Why?

3158
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:33,533
It's OK.

3159
02:50:33,533 --> 02:50:35,666
It's OK. The fact that we got.

3160
02:50:35,666 --> 02:50:38,750
Like, so much progress in such a short
amazing is incredible, though.

3161
02:50:40,016 --> 02:50:40,850
You know,

3162
02:50:45,616 --> 02:50:47,183
I think that works

3163
02:50:48,683 --> 02:50:49,916
what? Ow!

3164
02:50:49,916 --> 02:50:52,833
Ow, ow, ow.

3165
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:55,816
Did it get stuck on the left?

3166
02:50:55,816 --> 02:50:57,950
One got stuck on the bar. Damn, it's

3167
02:50:59,566 --> 02:51:00,983
it's kind of tilted, though.

3168
02:51:00,983 --> 02:51:01,700
The crane is a.

3169
02:51:01,700 --> 02:51:05,300
Little bit, like, tilted, I think.

3170
02:51:06,450 --> 02:51:08,516
I could.

3171
02:51:20,966 --> 02:51:21,800
Fuck.

3172
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:23,333
I don't know what to do here.

3173
02:51:23,333 --> 02:51:25,733
Why are you so jammed in there, huh?

3174
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:29,750
Why is he so jammed on the inside?

3175
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:30,900
What are right?

3176
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:34,316
Where do I go from here or lofts?

3177
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:36,050
I try lofts.

3178
02:51:38,033 --> 02:51:39,800
Or maybe I could try hooking the ah.

3179
02:51:39,800 --> 02:51:41,550
I could try hooking. The yellow part.

3180
02:51:41,550 --> 02:51:42,566
All right.

3181
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:43,950
Can I

3182
02:51:47,450 --> 02:51:48,000
hold on.

3183
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,466
Let me take a look at this.

3184
02:51:49,466 --> 02:51:51,800
No, the yellow part's too far down.

3185
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:52,883
I don't think. I think.

3186
02:51:52,883 --> 02:51:54,866
I don't think we can reach that

3187
02:51:54,916 --> 02:51:55,516
I mean, can we.

3188
02:51:55,516 --> 02:51:57,266
Get the green part.

3189
02:51:58,916 --> 02:52:00,166
Maybe you could get the green

3190
02:52:00,166 --> 02:52:01,800
the green circle.

3191
02:52:02,933 --> 02:52:04,500
The left side.

3192
02:52:05,066 --> 02:52:10,616
Oh, hold on, hold on.

3193
02:52:10,616 --> 02:52:11,866
I have an idea. I have an idea.

3194
02:52:17,950 --> 02:52:18,900
Like, right there.

3195
02:52:18,900 --> 02:52:19,966
And maybe

3196
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:26,700
that didn't help.

3197
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:28,166
I don't think that helped. We got to.

3198
02:52:28,166 --> 02:52:29,866
We got to go for the weak link.

3199
02:52:29,866 --> 02:52:31,950
OK, I'll just go for the.

3200
02:52:31,950 --> 02:52:33,616
Part that's closest to the bar.

3201
02:52:33,616 --> 02:52:36,466
I think if we loosen that up a bit, it'll

3202
02:52:37,766 --> 02:52:39,083
it'll work.

3203
02:52:42,716 --> 02:52:47,066
Put. It right here,

3204
02:52:47,816 --> 02:52:48,900
and then

3205
02:52:50,966 --> 02:52:52,250
I think that'll work.

3206
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:53,700
I think this works.

3207
02:52:54,383 --> 02:52:55,700
No, it doesn't.

3208
02:52:55,700 --> 02:52:58,066
I think inside the, the little hole fuck

3209
02:52:58,966 --> 02:53:02,216
perspective is hard man.

3210
02:53:04,850 --> 02:53:05,333
Oh my God.

3211
02:53:05,333 --> 02:53:07,850
The perspective is so hard

3212
02:53:08,783 --> 02:53:09,216
I know.

3213
02:53:09,216 --> 02:53:10,200
I missed.

3214
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:12,166
I missed.

3215
02:53:13,016 --> 02:53:15,216
Chi Chi.

3216
02:53:16,116 --> 02:53:18,200
I had to be so precise with that whole.

3217
02:53:21,350 --> 02:53:22,966
I think we got it

3218
02:53:24,416 --> 02:53:25,850
no, we didn't.

3219
02:53:25,850 --> 02:53:28,250
Ah, we're close, though.

3220
02:53:28,250 --> 02:53:29,750
We're getting close to that spot.

3221
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:31,966
I think I just got to get there. Mm

3222
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:35,866
hmm. Hmm.

3223
02:53:40,516 --> 02:53:41,700
My might've.

3224
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:42,450
It's it's OK.

3225
02:53:42,450 --> 02:53:45,733
We have plenty of zip put.

3226
02:53:46,316 --> 02:53:47,550
We have plenty of zip.

3227
02:53:47,550 --> 02:53:48,683
It's all right.

3228
02:53:51,233 --> 02:53:52,516
OK, I think that's.

3229
02:53:52,516 --> 02:53:53,966
I think that's good.

3230
02:53:54,866 --> 02:53:59,133
What what is that?

3231
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:03,233
Oh, I got the bars cooking me

3232
02:54:04,966 --> 02:54:07,050
all. I got, bro. Raw.

3233
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:08,100
The bar, the bar.

3234
02:54:08,100 --> 02:54:09,166
Talk to me.

3235
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:15,466
Chi Chi

3236
02:54:20,150 --> 02:54:22,400
OK? I can't go, like, too far.

3237
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,216
Oh, ha ha.

3238
02:54:29,933 --> 02:54:32,183
It's like it's tilted a little bit.

3239
02:54:32,183 --> 02:54:34,466
Do you see how the bars position, though?

3240
02:54:34,466 --> 02:54:37,583
So it's like I'm trying to get right here.

3241
02:54:38,366 --> 02:54:39,566
But the way.

3242
02:54:39,566 --> 02:54:42,300
Yeah, the way the bars are positioned
is so scummy.

3243
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:46,616
OK, I can't go for that one. Pop

3244
02:54:55,166 --> 02:54:56,783
ow, ow,

3245
02:54:57,900 --> 02:55:00,133
ow, ow, ow.

3246
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,333
Wait. Why

3247
02:55:03,716 --> 02:55:05,366
Oh, my god. God, is there.

3248
02:55:05,366 --> 02:55:08,000
Helping me again?

3249
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:09,616
Guys, they're helping me.

3250
02:55:12,083 --> 02:55:15,983
Why? Why do they keep helping me?

3251
02:55:17,016 --> 02:55:19,650
I just. My that that.

3252
02:55:19,650 --> 02:55:21,466
Will happen, huh?

3253
02:55:23,333 --> 02:55:25,966
Although I just all

3254
02:55:27,766 --> 02:55:29,666
this is the third time.

3255
02:55:29,666 --> 02:55:30,750
This is the third time.

3256
02:55:30,750 --> 02:55:32,066
That they've helped me, man.

3257
02:55:32,066 --> 02:55:34,216
Chi chi.

3258
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:35,416
I just.

3259
02:55:35,416 --> 02:55:36,016
I guess I just.

3260
02:55:36,016 --> 02:55:37,133
Lift it from the back now.

3261
02:55:37,133 --> 02:55:37,733
Right

3262
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:45,383
right

3263
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:50,033
what the heck?

3264
02:55:50,033 --> 02:55:51,716
Oh, God.

3265
02:55:57,083 --> 02:55:58,683
I still failed.

3266
02:55:58,683 --> 02:55:59,550
Too far back.

3267
02:55:59,550 --> 02:56:02,366
Yeah, a little too far back.

3268
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:05,933
Cry. But it's all right.

3269
02:56:05,933 --> 02:56:06,866
It's all right. We can get it.

3270
02:56:06,866 --> 02:56:08,366
We can get it now.

3271
02:56:16,316 --> 02:56:17,266
Please.

3272
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:20,800
Let's go.

3273
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:22,650
Oh, I got.

3274
02:56:22,650 --> 02:56:24,266
Another one.

3275
02:56:25,016 --> 02:56:27,283
OK, got

3276
02:56:28,016 --> 02:56:29,250
holy shit.

3277
02:56:29,250 --> 02:56:31,516
Oh, oh.

3278
02:56:32,866 --> 02:56:33,650
Oh, my God.

3279
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:35,900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

3280
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:40,100
Whoever, whoever is helping me this
this much throughout the night,

3281
02:56:40,616 --> 02:56:43,366
you're you're a real one.

3282
02:56:43,366 --> 02:56:45,683
I love you. I love you.

3283
02:56:48,266 --> 02:56:50,416
Now. Oh.

3284
02:56:52,016 --> 02:56:53,450
Wow. That's crazy.

3285
02:56:53,450 --> 02:56:55,250
So crazy.

3286
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:00,416
Oh, man, I.

3287
02:57:00,533 --> 02:57:01,433
I feel.

3288
02:57:01,433 --> 02:57:02,900
I feel empowered.

3289
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:05,216
We hope we still. Have enough points.

3290
02:57:05,216 --> 02:57:06,416
I thought I thought we were.

3291
02:57:06,416 --> 02:57:08,333
Going to use all of it just to get one.

3292
02:57:08,333 --> 02:57:09,750
But now we got three.

3293
02:57:09,750 --> 02:57:15,150
Now oh.

3294
02:57:16,816 --> 02:57:18,500
Sheesh.

3295
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:19,583
Yeah.

3296
02:57:20,566 --> 02:57:21,300
Thank you.

3297
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:23,666
Thank you. God, we love you.

3298
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:26,333
OK, good luck to the next person
that's got to do this.

3299
02:57:26,333 --> 02:57:28,616
Goodbye.
I'm going to go somewhere else now.

3300
02:57:30,050 --> 02:57:35,250
Ah, well, it's three ok.

3301
02:57:39,350 --> 02:57:41,700
Now what to try do.

3302
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:43,366
We can do one more.

3303
02:57:43,366 --> 02:57:44,700
We can do. Yeah, we got.

3304
02:57:44,700 --> 02:57:45,350
We got enough.

3305
02:57:45,350 --> 02:57:47,933
Points for, like, one more one more again.

3306
02:57:53,366 --> 02:57:55,283
This thing, right?

3307
02:57:55,283 --> 02:57:57,116
Yeah. Let's
go check on this thing right again.

3308
02:57:57,116 --> 02:57:59,850
It might be it. Might be possible maybe.

3309
02:58:00,266 --> 02:58:00,716
Maybe.

3310
02:58:01,916 --> 02:58:02,816
Hello, Stingray.

3311
02:58:02,816 --> 02:58:04,066
You still there?

3312
02:58:07,466 --> 02:58:09,266
I got reason.

3313
02:58:09,533 --> 02:58:10,666
Should I

3314
02:58:12,983 --> 02:58:13,500
all know?

3315
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:14,516
Should I.

3316
02:58:17,633 --> 02:58:17,866
Yeah.

3317
02:58:17,866 --> 02:58:18,866
It's so cool.

3318
02:58:18,866 --> 02:58:21,200
I'll get him and look at the boy.

3319
02:58:21,266 --> 02:58:23,816
Oh, uh, I.

3320
02:58:24,016 --> 02:58:25,216
I do. Of the. Studio.

3321
02:58:25,216 --> 02:58:26,866
I had to get him in the hole. Right.

3322
02:58:26,866 --> 02:58:36,066
It looks really hard
to get him in the hole. Mm.

3323
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:41,516
You think you only I should try,
but it's cute.

3324
02:58:41,533 --> 02:58:41,783
Yeah.

3325
02:58:41,783 --> 02:58:42,683
This thing are super.

3326
02:58:42,683 --> 02:58:44,483
It's horrible, man.

3327
02:58:49,950 --> 02:58:50,700
It looks hard.

3328
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:51,566
It does look hard.

3329
02:58:51,566 --> 02:58:54,083
I feel like I might get scammed again.

3330
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:00,450
Hold on.

3331
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:02,100
Before I find. This.

3332
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:04,233
Before I try stingray.

3333
02:59:04,233 --> 02:59:05,183
I'm going to go back to the.

3334
02:59:05,183 --> 02:59:07,316
Stingray,
but I just want to look at the other ones.

3335
02:59:08,216 --> 02:59:10,016
Oversized, plush elephants.

3336
02:59:10,016 --> 02:59:12,233
I want to see that
what's gone off the elephants

3337
02:59:14,816 --> 02:59:15,950
zoo. I had to push the card.

3338
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:16,850
Inside

3339
02:59:18,183 --> 02:59:20,000
is our way.

3340
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,316
What was this one?

3341
02:59:22,466 --> 02:59:25,283
I think I had to push the card
inside the ah.

3342
02:59:25,283 --> 02:59:27,383
Into the hole.

3343
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:29,966
Is this one hard? It looks pretty hard.

3344
02:59:29,966 --> 02:59:35,716
All right, now.

3345
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,550
Now this one looks like
you'll take me forever.

3346
02:59:39,683 --> 02:59:41,233
Nothing. You

3347
02:59:44,216 --> 02:59:48,000
OK, let's try and go back to Stingray.

3348
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,183
Unless I see something.
That I'm going to look at.

3349
02:59:50,333 --> 02:59:52,883
I want look. At this figurine. Again,

3350
02:59:52,883 --> 02:59:53,716
see how.

3351
02:59:54,166 --> 02:59:55,366
How much progress they've made.

3352
02:59:55,366 --> 02:59:57,116
They have made no progress.

3353
02:59:57,116 --> 03:00:00,000
These guys are stuck here forever.

3354
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:06,766
Dude, we have two cute girls

3355
03:00:06,766 --> 03:00:08,700
in our cart right now.

3356
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:11,550
Yeah, this one is just preoccupied.

3357
03:00:11,550 --> 03:00:13,550
This guy's still stuck on the.

3358
03:00:14,666 --> 03:00:16,283
No. Yeah.

3359
03:00:16,283 --> 03:00:18,000
Oh, my God. I feel bad for him.

3360
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:21,466
He's still stuck trying to get
the tag off of the of the box

3361
03:00:22,466 --> 03:00:24,616
or trying
to knock it off the the platform.

3362
03:00:24,616 --> 03:00:26,600
It's glued, buddy.

3363
03:00:29,150 --> 03:00:30,416
That one has to be glittery.

3364
03:00:30,416 --> 03:00:31,916
I don't know.

3365
03:00:33,166 --> 03:00:34,050
I'm not going to touch that.

3366
03:00:34,050 --> 03:00:35,900
Yeah. Let's go. Let's go to the stingray.

3367
03:00:35,900 --> 03:00:37,466
It's stingray time.

3368
03:00:42,750 --> 03:00:50,933
OK, all right.

3369
03:00:51,300 --> 03:00:53,666
How are we going to do this?

3370
03:00:53,666 --> 03:00:55,766
How are we going
to get our fish to come home?

3371
03:00:56,966 --> 03:00:59,416
I feel like
we got to go for the sides again, right?

3372
03:00:59,416 --> 03:01:09,316
Come like this much

3373
03:01:17,550 --> 03:01:19,050
grab the bite.

3374
03:01:20,783 --> 03:01:22,200
Try grabbing the little hole.

3375
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:26,216
Oh, what if we, like,
get the the crane into the flaps, right?

3376
03:01:27,016 --> 03:01:30,316
Can we get it into the flap of the ah,
the thingy?

3377
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:32,600
Like, without work

3378
03:01:40,050 --> 03:01:42,616
on? Let me take a look at what's online
looking at.

3379
03:01:43,283 --> 03:01:45,050
What is this part right here?

3380
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:46,950
Is this is this like part of its tail?

3381
03:01:46,950 --> 03:01:49,066
And what is that? Is that like a trick

3382
03:01:50,716 --> 03:01:54,500
is the tail like taped in with it?

3383
03:01:55,650 --> 03:02:00,566
Seems kind of heavy pick

3384
03:02:21,850 --> 03:02:23,850
I, I don't, I don't know.

3385
03:02:23,850 --> 03:02:24,600
Do I get the figure?

3386
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:25,433
I did get the figure.

3387
03:02:25,433 --> 03:02:27,316
Yeah, I got 31.

3388
03:02:27,316 --> 03:02:28,700
Three. Tonight.

3389
03:02:30,766 --> 03:02:33,266
Mm. Pushes

3390
03:02:33,383 --> 03:02:37,333
but a little bit more pushes, but

3391
03:02:38,250 --> 03:02:40,166
chi chi.

3392
03:02:40,166 --> 03:02:42,300
Chi Chi. OK.

3393
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:50,150
Back here

3394
03:02:58,316 --> 03:02:58,983
so that's you.

3395
03:02:58,983 --> 03:03:02,216
Anything. Hold on. I don't know to that.

3396
03:03:02,483 --> 03:03:04,550
That's the only thing to the to the.

3397
03:03:04,816 --> 03:03:05,883
Yeah.

3398
03:03:06,216 --> 03:03:08,966

3400
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:17,550
Maybe on I have an idea.

3401
03:03:17,866 --> 03:03:21,616
Could I have, I have a big brain idea

3402
03:03:24,233 --> 03:03:25,066
like right.

3403
03:03:25,066 --> 03:03:26,566
In that spot.

3404
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:33,466
That kind of works

3405
03:03:36,050 --> 03:03:36,316
yeah.

3406
03:03:36,316 --> 03:03:41,600
I got to push it. Around so that it's like
it goes sideways and then I think

3407
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:46,283
if I keep doing it like that
he'll, he'll gold it, he'll go down right.

3408
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,116
Cool.

3409
03:03:50,116 --> 03:03:50,300
Yeah.

3410
03:03:50,300 --> 03:03:52,733
I just got to keep at that,
that same method.

3411
03:04:02,033 --> 03:04:04,500
He's he's getting there slowly.

3412
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:06,766
Slowly. He's rotating.

3413
03:04:07,516 --> 03:04:09,450
OK, nice.

3414
03:04:13,650 --> 03:04:14,450
Maybe a little bit.

3415
03:04:14,450 --> 03:04:16,500
Less like that much

3416
03:04:21,233 --> 03:04:23,116
OK, that's good.

3417
03:04:23,116 --> 03:04:24,350
I think that's really good.

3418
03:04:24,350 --> 03:04:27,466
No, we are all now.

3419
03:04:27,466 --> 03:04:28,050
I fucked up.

3420
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:28,550
I fucked up.

3421
03:04:28,550 --> 03:04:30,350
I fucked up. Are

3422
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:35,000
I have like a.

3423
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,533
Not a lot of points left though.

3424
03:04:36,533 --> 03:04:37,916
I don't know.

3425
03:04:39,683 --> 03:04:46,983
I could. Go.

3426
03:04:49,200 --> 03:04:50,516
OK that's good. That's good.

3427
03:04:50,516 --> 03:04:52,400
That's really good. That's really good.

3428
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:53,550
That's really good.

3429
03:04:53,550 --> 03:04:54,833
It didn't move out much though.

3430
03:04:54,833 --> 03:04:57,050
So I mean,

3431
03:04:59,250 --> 03:05:01,050
I maybe we should try.

3432
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:02,716
Pushing the but

3433
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:04,950
if I go for the bite.

3434
03:05:05,966 --> 03:05:09,300
Yeah, it's
goal let's go to the to the bite

3435
03:05:10,466 --> 03:05:13,733
and see if we can move it. Push

3436
03:05:31,050 --> 03:05:32,000
hey, that kind of works

3437
03:05:36,200 --> 03:05:36,866
it rotated.

3438
03:05:36,866 --> 03:05:38,483
Yeah, OK.

3439
03:05:39,766 --> 03:05:41,416
What I do now.

3440
03:05:42,383 --> 03:05:42,866
What the fuck.

3441
03:05:42,866 --> 03:05:44,550
Do I do now?

3442
03:05:46,733 --> 03:05:48,866
I could.

3443
03:05:49,950 --> 03:05:52,816
Maybe like that the his face

3444
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,150
a little before his face.

3445
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:02,600
Oh, I didn't do anything.

3446
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:07,466
Now. Are OK.

3447
03:06:07,466 --> 03:06:09,533
Maybe I have to go a little bit more.

3448
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:10,950
Yeah,

3449
03:06:16,950 --> 03:06:18,683
not too far.

3450
03:06:19,500 --> 03:06:22,883
It like that much without much is good.

3451
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:27,866
Yeah, yeah.

3452
03:06:27,866 --> 03:06:30,316
Oh, wow. OK.

3453
03:06:31,616 --> 03:06:33,200
The job. Really good job.

3454
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:34,616
Very good job. Good job.

3455
03:06:34,616 --> 03:06:36,116
Yeah, ok.

3456
03:06:43,200 --> 03:06:44,150
I think

3457
03:06:45,500 --> 03:06:47,516
just moving on the face.

3458
03:06:47,516 --> 03:06:49,466
Hold on, hold on.

3459
03:06:49,466 --> 03:06:51,500
I might sound like I might sound crazy.

3460
03:06:51,683 --> 03:06:53,333
You're like.

3461
03:06:53,333 --> 03:06:56,033
Cut I do that

3462
03:06:59,366 --> 03:06:59,733
galore.

3463
03:06:59,733 --> 03:07:01,516
Bit more inside.

3464
03:07:06,466 --> 03:07:06,983
That's.

3465
03:07:06,983 --> 03:07:08,750
Good. That is so Padres.

3466
03:07:08,750 --> 03:07:10,133
Oh, my God.

3467
03:07:11,933 --> 03:07:15,300
Bro, my cock is so far right now.

3468
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:22,850
OK, I think I should go for.

3469
03:07:22,850 --> 03:07:23,966
But yeah.

3470
03:07:23,966 --> 03:07:26,266
I might go for the blood again.
Let's go for the blood again.

3471
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:30,950
Cut too far

3472
03:07:36,950 --> 03:07:38,333
hopefully it wasn't too far.

3473
03:07:38,333 --> 03:07:39,550
I don't know.

3474
03:07:40,366 --> 03:07:41,066
Not that wasn't.

3475
03:07:41,066 --> 03:07:42,450
I wasn't. OK.

3476
03:07:43,733 --> 03:07:46,433
Oh, maybe.

3477
03:07:46,516 --> 03:07:47,216
Maybe I should.

3478
03:07:47,216 --> 03:07:48,000
I can push it.

3479
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:49,400
Maybe I can push it now.

3480
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:50,183
Can I push it.

3481
03:07:50,183 --> 03:07:54,300
Hard enough to push. It i feel like if I
push, it's going to get jammed inside.

3482
03:07:54,383 --> 03:07:55,466
That seems like a bad idea.

3483
03:07:55,466 --> 03:07:58,166
If I, if I if I push right now.

3484
03:07:58,283 --> 03:08:00,816
Because pushing too early.

3485
03:08:00,816 --> 03:08:02,966
I could. Not.

3486
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,450
Not the best idea

3487
03:08:08,066 --> 03:08:10,333
hmm. Hmm.

3488
03:08:10,333 --> 03:08:12,500
Mm hmm.

3489
03:08:13,250 --> 03:08:14,550
Mm hmm.

3490
03:08:14,550 --> 03:08:17,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3491
03:08:17,383 --> 03:08:19,200
Oh, shit.

3492
03:08:23,716 --> 03:08:25,516
It is so close.

3493
03:08:44,116 --> 03:08:46,200
Oh, oh, oh, man.

3494
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:47,816
This is getting me excited. Is getting me.

3495
03:08:47,816 --> 03:08:50,500
It's are really excited.

3496
03:08:51,133 --> 03:08:52,050
Give me a hand.

3497
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:55,633
Come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

3498
03:08:57,316 --> 03:08:57,983
We can get it.

3499
03:08:59,700 --> 03:09:01,333
We can
get it within the amount that we have.

3500
03:09:01,333 --> 03:09:03,866
I believe

3501
03:09:07,433 --> 03:09:08,150
it's getting there.

3502
03:09:08,150 --> 03:09:08,866
It's slow going there.

3503
03:09:08,866 --> 03:09:10,250
I'm going to go for the again.

3504
03:09:10,250 --> 03:09:10,916
Yeah.

3505
03:09:13,016 --> 03:09:13,966
One more time.

3506
03:09:13,966 --> 03:09:15,533
It's time for the. To the bite.

3507
03:09:15,533 --> 03:09:16,666
To the bite.

3508
03:09:19,316 --> 03:09:20,783
But what does it look like?

3509
03:09:20,783 --> 03:09:22,700
It's just like a little section
back there.

3510
03:09:22,700 --> 03:09:23,616
It still.

3511
03:09:23,616 --> 03:09:24,300
Means

3512
03:09:27,550 --> 03:09:36,916
could. OK.

3513
03:09:43,133 --> 03:09:46,166
That didn't really help much, did it?

3514
03:09:46,166 --> 03:09:47,783
Should I just

3515
03:09:48,650 --> 03:09:52,766
oh, the just push it a little push down.

3516
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,633
I just push it down a little bit. OK.

3517
03:09:58,133 --> 03:10:00,500
Grab it from the middle. Hmm.

3518
03:10:02,783 --> 03:10:05,166
Perfect.

3519
03:10:05,633 --> 03:10:07,800
And let's see what happens
if we do grab it from the middle.

3520
03:10:18,316 --> 03:10:18,950
Nothing.

3521
03:10:18,950 --> 03:10:22,200
Absolutely nothing. OK,

3522
03:10:26,916 --> 03:10:30,250
oh, I want to push it so bad,
but I don't know.

3523
03:10:30,300 --> 03:10:32,300
That's a wise thing to do right now.

3524
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:36,883
Cut. Hold on.

3525
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:40,166
Let me try it.

3526
03:10:40,166 --> 03:10:42,683
Let me try something stupid.

3527
03:10:46,550 --> 03:10:52,350
Oh, what do I do here?

3528
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:55,700
Guys?

3529
03:10:55,700 --> 03:10:58,100
What do I do
here? I'm running out. Zip. Oh.

3530
03:10:58,766 --> 03:10:59,416
I'm going out.

3531
03:10:59,416 --> 03:11:01,283
I'm running off TV.

3532
03:11:04,883 --> 03:11:06,233
I had to push the button.

3533
03:11:06,233 --> 03:11:07,500
I'm really.

3534
03:11:10,433 --> 03:11:12,683
OK. All I'll try.

3535
03:11:12,683 --> 03:11:13,100
Do not.

3536
03:11:13,100 --> 03:11:17,266
Then put

3537
03:11:23,933 --> 03:11:25,733
I hope this works.

3538
03:11:30,533 --> 03:11:33,900
As well till

3539
03:11:33,983 --> 03:11:36,200
that's in work. No,

3540
03:11:38,216 --> 03:11:40,550
that did not work at all.

3541
03:11:42,383 --> 03:11:43,916
And ask for stuff again.

3542
03:11:43,916 --> 03:11:44,366
I think.

3543
03:11:44,366 --> 03:11:47,483
I think styles
been a little too friendly of me today.

3544
03:11:47,633 --> 03:11:50,266
They've helped me three times already,

3545
03:11:50,416 --> 03:11:54,450
and I got three prises,
so I think I got to get one on my own.

3546
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:55,433
Maybe.

3547
03:11:55,883 --> 03:11:57,083
I don't know.

3548
03:12:01,350 --> 03:12:03,016
I. I think I have.

3549
03:12:03,016 --> 03:12:04,883
I'll have an idea though.

3550
03:12:04,883 --> 03:12:06,350
I have a, I have an idea.

3551
03:12:17,633 --> 03:12:18,866
No, it didn't work.

3552
03:12:18,866 --> 03:12:20,450
I'll know what I do.

3553
03:12:20,450 --> 03:12:21,900
I was stuck

3554
03:12:27,566 --> 03:12:27,850
sure.

3555
03:12:28,216 --> 03:12:28,583
I tried to.

3556
03:12:28,583 --> 03:12:30,500
Push his face down

3557
03:12:31,916 --> 03:12:35,383
you know, let's push his face

3558
03:12:38,566 --> 03:12:41,216
I hope this is not a bad idea.

3559
03:12:43,316 --> 03:12:45,800
Oh. No, it's not work.

3560
03:12:45,833 --> 03:12:47,816
That's not going to work.

3561
03:12:52,466 --> 03:12:54,116
Oh, man.

3562
03:12:54,116 --> 03:12:56,666
Oh, man. Oh, boy.

3563
03:12:56,783 --> 03:12:59,116
All right, you guys

3564
03:13:02,933 --> 03:13:04,066
I really want to try and.

3565
03:13:04,066 --> 03:13:05,216
See if I could get the hook in the.

3566
03:13:05,216 --> 03:13:06,650
Flops.

3567
03:13:10,516 --> 03:13:11,666
You think that's.

3568
03:13:11,666 --> 03:13:13,100
I'll be possible.

3569
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:20,366
I go for his wings.

3570
03:13:22,050 --> 03:13:24,750
Or his fins, whatever you call it.

3571
03:13:26,566 --> 03:13:28,316
And see if that works.

3572
03:13:34,666 --> 03:13:35,116
I don't.

3573
03:13:35,116 --> 03:13:35,750
I don't think.

3574
03:13:35,750 --> 03:13:37,100
I don't think so.

3575
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:37,766
Shit.

3576
03:13:41,450 --> 03:13:42,950
It did something

3577
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:48,000
off on the gap. Oh.

3578
03:13:51,566 --> 03:13:53,516
I'm running out of points.

3579
03:13:53,516 --> 03:13:56,600
Oh. On guys.

3580
03:13:56,600 --> 03:13:57,716
I'm running out points.

3581
03:13:57,716 --> 03:13:58,950
Oh, no,

3582
03:14:10,100 --> 03:14:13,416
fuck me.

3583
03:14:15,816 --> 03:14:17,266
It's there in the leg part.

We have like nine. Tries left.

3608
03:15:38,066 --> 03:15:41,250

03:16:49,400 --> 03:16:50,750
I don't know what to do.

3621
03:16:50,750 --> 03:16:53,400

It just like it's not going to do much.

03:17:57,566 --> 03:17:59,916
Maybe I should go for back here.

3640
03:17:59,916 --> 03:18:01,066

Though, having to, like, you know.

3767
03:24:59,116 --> 03:25:01,016
That was about a soul.

3768
03:25:01,016 --> 03:25:02,550
I put down.

3769
03:25:02,550 --> 03:25:06,300
$300 for you, for this,

3770
03:25:06,566 --> 03:25:09,150
for this site entire stream.

3771
03:25:09,316 --> 03:25:10,500
And we got. Four prises, all that.

3772
03:25:10,500 --> 03:25:13,516
I think that's worth
I think that's pretty worth it.

3773
03:25:14,333 --> 03:25:15,050
Right?

3774
03:25:16,433 --> 03:25:16,916
I don't know.

3775
03:25:16,916 --> 03:25:18,350
Is that worth it?

3776
03:25:18,866 --> 03:25:20,116
I'm not sure.

3777
03:25:23,750 --> 03:25:27,233
Like I can't sell for four for prises 300.

3778
03:25:29,100 --> 03:25:30,200
Not it.

3779
03:25:30,200 --> 03:25:31,400
Seems that.

3780
03:25:31,883 --> 03:25:33,950
OK OK well.

3781
03:25:33,950 --> 03:25:35,400
We still we still did it.

3782
03:25:35,400 --> 03:25:37,916
We still got a lot of prises and

3783
03:25:38,516 --> 03:25:42,383
thank you guys for being my Heitman
and for also, like, giving me advice.

3784
03:25:42,516 --> 03:25:44,400
He had the most

3785
03:25:46,366 --> 03:25:46,766
it was.

3786
03:25:46,766 --> 03:25:48,000
It was a lot of fun. Yeah.

3787
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:49,916
This is my first time playing,
I thought ever.

3788
03:25:49,916 --> 03:25:52,800
So I've never experienced, like,

3789
03:25:53,933 --> 03:25:54,416
what it's like.

3790
03:25:54,416 --> 03:25:57,166
There is definitely
some input lag of the whole, like,

3791
03:25:57,566 --> 03:26:00,500
you know, trying to

3792
03:26:01,616 --> 03:26:03,566
position the crane correctly.

3793
03:26:03,566 --> 03:26:05,366
So that was a little annoying.

3794
03:26:05,366 --> 03:26:05,850
To deal with.

3795
03:26:05,850 --> 03:26:08,600
But same time, like, once
you got used to it, it's ok.

3796
03:26:09,383 --> 03:26:10,950
It's pretty OK.

3797
03:26:11,366 --> 03:26:13,200
I don't know what other like thing

3798
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:16,916
I would have tried to go for
but I'm pretty happy.

3799
03:26:16,916 --> 03:26:18,983
Yeah, I'm pretty happy with everything
we got so far.

3800
03:26:19,666 --> 03:26:21,466
There's a seal. All

3801
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:25,133
this on looks really adorable.

3802
03:26:25,133 --> 03:26:27,416
What's an adorable plushie?

3803
03:26:27,533 --> 03:26:29,516
Whenever there's like other ones
I missed out on

3804
03:26:29,516 --> 03:26:31,700
because like,
I was looking at all the top options.

3805
03:26:33,416 --> 03:26:35,066
Nana Boom on you.

3806
03:26:35,066 --> 03:26:37,350
To me, I don't know who that is.

3807
03:26:39,950 --> 03:26:40,366
Those are.

3808
03:26:40,366 --> 03:26:42,800
Those are two people from Demon Slayer

3809
03:26:43,883 --> 03:26:47,033
and curvy is a curvy plushie.

3810
03:26:52,150 --> 03:26:54,650
I don't think any of these ones are really
that hard.

3811
03:26:55,066 --> 03:26:56,000
It's awesome. Magical.

3812
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:58,316
Oh, there's another girl figurine.

3813
03:26:59,250 --> 03:27:00,733
And Goggle

3814
03:27:01,916 --> 03:27:03,716
and another. Red one.

3815
03:27:03,716 --> 03:27:04,616
What's this.

3816
03:27:04,616 --> 03:27:05,933
One? Looks cute.

3817
03:27:10,400 --> 03:27:13,700
I have no idea what this is.

3818
03:27:15,250 --> 03:27:18,983
Yeah, the one looks really cute, so I'm
happy off the the other one that we got.

3819
03:27:19,433 --> 03:27:22,016
OK. Wow.

3820
03:27:24,233 --> 03:27:26,250
And he's a stretcher, but not as enough.

3821
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:27,416
Yeah. No more crying games.

3822
03:27:27,416 --> 03:27:29,866
No more no more crying games for today.

3823
03:27:30,116 --> 03:27:30,316
We are.

3824
03:27:30,316 --> 03:27:33,500
Denzel,
I'm going to close out close out of that,

3825
03:27:34,350 --> 03:27:36,683
and I'll see you guys in the bedroom
little quick.

3826
03:27:36,683 --> 03:27:39,200
All right,
just give me a give me a second.

3827
03:27:41,666 --> 03:27:42,016
I check

3828
03:27:42,016 --> 03:27:47,300
something OK?

3829
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:54,500
Right.

3830
03:27:56,150 --> 03:27:57,716
I think

3831
03:28:00,150 --> 03:28:01,066
I think we're good now.

3832
03:28:01,066 --> 03:28:01,800
All right.

3833
03:28:03,983 --> 03:28:05,333
Oh, that's.

3834
03:28:05,333 --> 03:28:06,166
I still can't.

3835
03:28:06,166 --> 03:28:09,750
Believe, like,
they came to help us four times

3836
03:28:10,250 --> 03:28:12,683
because we just sucked at its overhead.

3837
03:28:13,283 --> 03:28:15,600
At least that's how I felt.
Like, like, um.

3838
03:28:16,133 --> 03:28:17,183
We were, we were.

3839
03:28:17,183 --> 03:28:19,500
Eating arse for the majority of it.

3840
03:28:19,700 --> 03:28:23,066
So then on, the person came
by and was like, hey, let me help you all

3841
03:28:23,183 --> 03:28:25,250
with all, like, of this thing,
or you wanted didn't seem that bad.

3842
03:28:25,250 --> 03:28:28,850
And of the the card one
where we had to knock off the card in.

3843
03:28:28,850 --> 03:28:30,900
So the into the hole.

3844
03:28:30,900 --> 03:28:32,816
That one didn't seem too bad. Either.

3845
03:28:32,816 --> 03:28:34,216
So I don't know why they came

3846
03:28:34,216 --> 03:28:36,766
and helped us out there,
but hey, I still appreciate it.

3847
03:28:36,766 --> 03:28:37,433
I'm happy.

3848
03:28:37,433 --> 03:28:39,766
I'm so happy that they helped us out

3849
03:28:41,616 --> 03:28:45,500
Donny. Nah.

3850
03:28:46,400 --> 03:28:49,350
Yeah, I had a lot of fun tonight
and I hope you guys enjoyed it.

3851
03:28:49,350 --> 03:28:52,733
Still watching my moulding process,
but also

3852
03:28:54,533 --> 03:28:57,116
just seeing me fucking elated as hell

3853
03:28:57,383 --> 03:28:59,550
when we got the we actually got the prise,

3854
03:29:01,433 --> 03:29:02,816
so I didn't want to say

3855
03:29:02,816 --> 03:29:05,816
tomorrow is gonna be our karaoke stream.

3856
03:29:05,816 --> 03:29:10,516

3858
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:15,533
it's going to be archived
because I think it's fine.

3859
03:29:15,533 --> 03:29:18,200
I don't mind it too much on such days.

3860
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:19,200
I don't know about YouTube.

3861
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:22,050
You, too, might be having
a little bit trouble with archiving the,

3862
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:25,166
um, the karaoke stream, but, you know,

03:29:25,183 --> 03:29:29,483

03:29:35,633 --> 03:29:37,216
I'm going
to be trying to sing a lot of songs.

3868
03:29:37,216 --> 03:29:40,166
I don't know how long it's going to last,
but we're gonna have a fun time because.

3869
03:29:40,166 --> 03:29:41,066
It's been a while since.

3870
03:29:41,066 --> 03:29:42,533
We've sang and I feel like

3871
03:29:42,533 --> 03:29:46,366
it'd be nice to have a good celebration
in store for this song,

3872
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:50,700
for all the milestones that we reached
recently via having a karaoke.

3873
03:29:50,716 --> 03:29:53,800
Because, you know, I want to sing,
I feel like singing and some

3874
03:29:55,950 --> 03:29:56,850
I've wanted to share

3875
03:29:56,850 --> 03:30:00,600
a bunch of new songs with you guys
that I've learnt throughout the weeks. OK,

3876
03:30:02,850 --> 03:30:05,383
I'm watching some, some,
some of the old songs

3877
03:30:05,400 --> 03:30:06,650
that we've done before too.

3878
03:30:06,650 --> 03:30:11,100
But I want to try and, you know, flex
some new ones that we haven't tried before

3879
03:30:11,150 --> 03:30:14,566
because, you know, it's fun
to learn new songs for karaoke.

3880
03:30:15,450 --> 03:30:17,516
And I do the same old ones
every single time, right?

3881
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:20,000
Yeah.

3882
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:20,716
Yeah.

3883
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:24,766
OK, but I'm going
to go and look for so-and-so tonight.

3884
03:30:24,766 --> 03:30:27,016

3891
03:30:40,616 --> 03:30:43,800
Of the donations and the subs
that happened throughout the stream.

03:30:44,150 --> 03:30:44,566
Zero.

Finally I can donate love
you feel for all.

3899
03:30:57,116 --> 03:30:58,500
For people that don't know.

3900
03:30:58,500 --> 03:31:00,866
People that don't have
people should be able to donate

3901
03:31:00,866 --> 03:31:04,616
now with a card because I was dumb
and never said that out for like the past.

3902
03:31:05,700 --> 03:31:07,966
What year plus?

3903
03:31:08,100 --> 03:31:11,866
Because I didn't know I could set up
for a card donation and stuff like that.

03:31:11,866 --> 03:31:12,766
So yeah.

03:32:30,316 --> 03:32:31,066
And also hypnosis.

3936
03:32:31,066 --> 03:32:33,833
Thank you for the $50 still.

3937
03:32:33,833 --> 03:32:37,100
Yes, I heard your advice and

3938
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:39,716
what really happened
was the assistants at the end.

3939
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:43,166
Yeah, they hit me up in South Korea.

3940
03:32:43,166 --> 03:32:44,416
Thank you for the.

3941
03:32:44,416 --> 03:32:45,116
Oh no.

3942
03:32:45,116 --> 03:32:46,666
And Alice, thank you for the deal.

3943
03:32:46,666 --> 03:32:49,350
Now so please catch this dog.

3944
03:32:50,150 --> 03:32:53,566
Are you talking about me or are you
talking about the one in the, the machine.

3945
03:32:55,516 --> 03:32:56,900
And Zeeshan, thank you for that's all.

3946
03:32:56,900 --> 03:32:59,566
Not so. And Bye-Bye.

3947
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:03,450
Thank you for the 1000 bits
and the onic. A.

3948
03:33:04,650 --> 03:33:08,516
Unique I'll be having a great day
thank you for the 50 ones as well.

3949
03:33:08,633 --> 03:33:11,550
And the help
you've been enjoying the screaming, bro.

3950
03:33:13,316 --> 03:33:14,750
OK, I think I caught up

3951
03:33:14,750 --> 03:33:18,800

and stuff for today.

3952
03:33:19,516 --> 03:33:21,450
I'll catch you guys tomorrow

3953
03:33:21,450 --> 03:33:24,233
OK, have a good night's
sleep well and take care.

3954
03:33:24,233 --> 03:33:25,550
I love you.

3955
03:33:26,150 --> 03:33:26,483
Again.

3956
03:33:26,483 --> 03:33:28,583
Be sure to join the discord
if you haven't already.

3957
03:33:28,583 --> 03:33:29,600
Is this gorgeous?

3958
03:33:29,600 --> 03:33:34,066
I shuttle everybody that is in the server
will get up to the announcements on

3959
03:33:34,066 --> 03:33:37,716

3960
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:39,150

3962
03:33:42,866 --> 03:33:45,566
Also be sure to subscribe on YouTube
and follow me on Twitter as well.

3963
03:33:45,566 --> 03:33:47,366
OK, it mean a lot

3964
03:33:48,533 --> 03:33:50,783
and like
I said yesterday, we're working on merch.

3965
03:33:50,933 --> 03:33:53,966
I got to talk with Far with a friend

3966
03:33:54,350 --> 03:33:59,216
or like somebody I'm talking to
is coordinating with me right now.

3967
03:33:59,216 --> 03:34:01,050
Let's get some shuttle merch out.

3968
03:34:01,050 --> 03:34:05,033
And Zal, we've decided on a lot of cool
things, so if you guys are excited for it,

3969
03:34:05,033 --> 03:34:08,033
we're going to have a bundle
and it's like.

3970
03:34:08,216 --> 03:34:08,566
I don't want to.

3971
03:34:08,566 --> 03:34:11,516
Spoil too much about it, but there's
definitely going to be like, you know,

3972
03:34:13,100 --> 03:34:16,550
like first come, first serve
exclusive stuff I think would be cool.

3973
03:34:16,550 --> 03:34:20,150
Like I don't know
if people would like signed postcards, but

3974
03:34:20,600 --> 03:34:24,450
I think I think like doing a hand signed
postcard would be a cool idea, right?

3975
03:34:25,466 --> 03:34:28,666
So that might be something
I'll do for like people

3976
03:34:28,666 --> 03:34:31,916
that get first dibs
on like certain merch. So.

3977
03:34:33,500 --> 03:34:34,700
Yeah, it's coming.

3978
03:34:34,700 --> 03:34:36,266
It's I'm really excited man.

3979
03:34:36,266 --> 03:34:39,800
I can't believe it's finally coming.

3980
03:34:40,516 --> 03:34:44,633
OK, baby,
I'm going to look for somebody to read,

3981
03:34:44,633 --> 03:34:47,750
but in the meantime,
I will put up an ad, so.

3982
03:34:47,850 --> 03:34:50,066
Yeah, give me a second. All right.

3983
03:34:50,066 --> 03:34:52,650
Officer Omar,
thank you for the gift subs, bro.

3984
03:34:52,650 --> 03:34:54,383
Hope you enjoy the stream.

3985
03:34:54,683 --> 03:34:56,366
All right, Barbie

3986
03:34:59,950 --> 03:35:03,083
you know, for the people
that can still see or can still see me

3987
03:35:03,083 --> 03:35:07,166
through the ads, I was thinking of doing,
like, a cute little t shirt and

3988
03:35:08,483 --> 03:35:09,083
a cap.

3989
03:35:09,083 --> 03:35:12,050
I was thinking about doing
some kind of cap, but I'm not sure.

3990
03:35:12,050 --> 03:35:16,133
Like, a, like, air,
a cotton buckle cap with, like, a curved

3991
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:20,900
and something like a logo on the front
or like a tube shuffle or.

3992
03:35:21,383 --> 03:35:24,916
I was also thinking of, like,
acrylic stands and maybe some charms.

3993
03:35:26,033 --> 03:35:27,800
Mm. Hmm.

3994
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:30,266
Since I think a lot.

3995
03:35:30,266 --> 03:35:32,150
Of people, like, acrylic stands.

3996
03:35:32,150 --> 03:35:32,866
Right.

3997
03:35:34,516 --> 03:35:35,566
Now, charms are a must.

3998
03:35:35,566 --> 03:35:38,266
I always, like, wanna make sure I can.

3999
03:35:38,266 --> 03:35:41,450
The charms are like
my favourite kind of merch to sell.

4000
03:35:41,450 --> 03:35:44,516
I always try to,
you know, get some of that whenever I see

4001
03:35:44,550 --> 03:35:47,900
available icons, cons,
or all my friends are selling charms.

4002
03:35:47,900 --> 03:35:50,816
So yeah, hopefully you guys
enjoy the terms when they come out, sell

4003
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:57,833
OK, I think we're going to go and raid.

4004
03:35:59,400 --> 03:36:03,000
Mm. I'm probably.

4005
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:05,100
Gonna go and raid puff pop.

4006
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:05,933
Tonight.

4007
03:36:09,033 --> 03:36:11,233
You know, it's Glory Buff Pop

4008
03:36:12,716 --> 03:36:14,300
since they had a recent art debut,

4009
03:36:14,300 --> 03:36:16,666
I think it'd be really nice to go
and show them some love.

4010
03:36:17,566 --> 03:36:19,716
It's been a bit
since we've created them, so.

4011
03:36:19,733 --> 03:36:21,116
Yeah, let's go see what they're up to.

4012
03:36:27,533 --> 03:36:28,666
Have a good night, guys.

4013
03:36:28,666 --> 03:36:29,516
Take care. All right.

4014
03:36:29,516 --> 03:36:31,616
I love you.
And I'll see you tomorrow for the karaoke.

4015
03:36:31,616 --> 03:36:33,683
To be sure. Come by.
All right. It's going to.

4016
03:36:33,683 --> 03:36:36,100
Be a big celebration, and I'm going to be.

4017
03:36:36,116 --> 03:36:38,216
We're going to have. Drinks, alcohol.

4018
03:36:38,216 --> 03:36:41,866
And I might buy some wings
to celebrate the occasion.

4019
03:36:41,866 --> 03:36:43,966
So just for just for that night.

4020
03:36:49,700 --> 03:36:49,966
Yeah.

4021
03:36:49,966 --> 03:36:51,550
I mean, like,

4022
03:36:52,016 --> 03:36:53,000
it's it's been a bit.

4023
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,766
Since I've, like, had a proper
celebration.

4024
03:36:56,416 --> 03:36:57,266
Karaoke.

4025
03:36:57,266 --> 03:36:58,166
I don't think I've.

4026
03:36:58,166 --> 03:37:00,166
I've ever had a celebration
karaoke, have I?

4027
03:37:00,166 --> 03:37:01,733
It's just been regular karaoke session.

4028
03:37:01,733 --> 03:37:03,750
So this one will be, like, our first

4029
03:37:03,750 --> 03:37:07,216
no real official type of, like, party
type deal.

4030
03:37:07,500 --> 03:37:08,150
All right,

4031
03:37:09,500 --> 03:37:10,066
all right.

4032
03:37:10,066 --> 03:37:12,316
Have a good one, guys,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

4033
03:37:12,600 --> 03:37:15,116
I love you, and I'll catch you around, OK?

4034
03:37:16,466 --> 03:37:17,066
Sleep well.

4035
03:37:17,066 --> 03:37:20,483
If it's Night-Time for you
and if it's daytime for you,

4036
03:37:20,516 --> 03:37:23,033
have a good rest of your day. All right?

4037
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,283
And thank you for the fun time.

4038
03:37:25,283 --> 03:37:28,650
Our little arcades in
with all the Korean games.

4039
03:37:28,666 --> 03:37:29,216
All right?

4040
03:37:30,066 --> 03:37:31,350
Yeah. Thanks for helping me.

4041
03:37:31,350 --> 03:37:33,366
And thank you to the staff
for helping me, too.

4042
03:37:33,533 --> 03:37:34,516
OK, got to go now.

4043
03:37:34,516 --> 03:37:35,000
Bye bye.

4044
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:35,850
Bye bye.

4045
03:37:38,250 --> 03:37:42,566
Easy bug.
