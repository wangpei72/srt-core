1
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,600
But, um.

2
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,850
Hello. Hello.

3
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,933
Wait. Why am I here?

4
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:42,383
Hold on.

5
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,216
Give me a second.

6
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,416
What the heck?

7
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,100
Oh. Oops.

8
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,666
OK. Ah.

9
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,750
Hello.

10
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,716
Hi, guys.

11
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,883
Good morning.

12
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,650
Good evening, everybody.

13
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,833
They're waiting for me.

14
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,016
Let's get right into the game.

15
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,933
I think I just want to say hi there.

16
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,800
I love you guys a lot.

17
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,650
Mm hmm.

18
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:08,950
Some of the notifications will be off

19
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,250
for the stream,
so we can just focus on the collab with Vox.

20
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,233
Ike and Reimu.

21
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:17,050
So I just want to say, like,
those will be off, but

22
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,250
I'll be reading through the donations,
and all the subs

23
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:23,533
are after the mushrooms over
or after the collab's over.

24
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,783
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

25
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,350
I will be there.

26
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,300
All right.

27
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,383
I think they're waiting for me, though.

28
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:32,183
I don't wanna keep them waiting
any longer, ok?

29
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,850
Reimu just called me a bitch, so hold on

30
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:41,283
OK, let me see.

31
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,000
Where is he now? That's a reality?

32
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,633
No. Mm hmm.

33
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,650
Yeah.

34
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,233

00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,950
Oh, Hello.

Hello. Here you go now.

38
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,300

Yeah, that this story, it's not just,

Wait.How do you do that?

85
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,100
You go to the tent.

Hello? Open the door.

113
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,150
You don't even want to play.

114
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,766
All right, here we are.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,683
Oh, my God.

Yeah, the game is very loud.

Yeah, me too.

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,366
Oh, my. God. It's still so loud.

133
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:10,900
So sorry.

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,850
My favourite sandwich?

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,250
What is my favourite sandwich?

143
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,183

Hey, Jason.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm looking for that box of tape recorders

151
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,900
while you're setting
those stupid ghosts up.

152
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,150
What? What?

153
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,800
You'll find them in and lineal
oh, you owe you big time shooting range.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,400
can't afford to lose many prises. Johnny.

155
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,233
Johnny. I‘m John Jones. Yeah.

156
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,816
I thought it said Johnny.

157
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,166
I like Jenny.

158
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,900
Jenny, Jenny.

159
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,450
You got the legs, right? That's right.

160
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,100
Survival says lt's in.

161
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,783
I wish this doctor would be quiet.

162
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,483
And you got new legs.

163
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,750
You said you want the dog to be quiet.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,700
There's a dog got the duck. It's another.

165
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,233
This is nothing.

166
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,533
Nothing, nothing.

167
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:24,900
What?

168
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,533
Yeah, it keeps talking.

169
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,083
Make it stop.

170
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,916
Okay, OK, let me just.

171
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,083
I'm going in. There's another.

172
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, there's another note.

173
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,816
It says narrator shouldn't
be running this hard either.

174
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:39,050
Johnny's got something more hard in this
or the wiring's worse

175
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,050
than the damn hedge par
for the course with Johnny Bills.

176
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,666
Just charge him an arm and leg and look.
What the. Fuck?

177
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:46,633
Who the fuck is Johnny? OK, whatever.

178
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:49,233
I have no idea. OK, why are you so ugly,Vox?

179
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:50,833
You don't need to.

180
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,916
Complain about the bell.

181
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,916
I'm going inside
oh, once it's my throat, there

182
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,533
for staff to hear my current objective.

183
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:03,283
Wait. How do you run?

184
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:04,550
You hold. Hold. Don't shoot.

185
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,816
I'm going to throw rocks
through your window, you bitch.

186
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,816
It's time to see your current
available money.

187
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,950
Wait.
You can. Go into the. Trees. Oh, my God.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,383
Look, I'm a tree.

189
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,233
Oh, wait. No, I'm not.

190
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:15,550
I got. You.

191
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,100
That's so creepy.

192
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,650
I'm a bush.

193
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,316
If I'm not a bush, I'm no one.
No one in the works. I'm a bush.

194
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,550
I'm a bush.

195
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,683
I'm a bush. If I'm not a bush, I'm no one.

196
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,850
How do you
how do you know every reference I made?

197
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,200
OK, that's  so culture
that one is exceptionally British.

198
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,783
That's a very British video.

199
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,733
Have you seen the one

200
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,100
where the guy is just like,
how many cigarettes have you got?

201
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,566
Yeah.

202
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,233
So many cigarettes.

203
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:45,733
Yeah. Mom.

204
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,900
And he just smashes his head into another.

205
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:50,200
So is so.

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,983
Your. Opinion it's OK. I already kind of.

207
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,350
Have you seen the one that works?
Like where it's like.

208
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,483
Can't believe I drunk you all.

209
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,933
I thought you're going to say,
I can't believe he's on this.

210
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:00,916
Yes, you all.

211
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,783
Can you tell the time? Yes.

212
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:06,283
He turns toward the clock and he tells it,
I am not fucking drunk.

213
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,650
I'm going to slap you
with my flashlight and keep this up.

214
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:11,716
I'll try it.

215
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,350
You're going to you're going to

216
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,383
you're going to smack your flashlight on
my tongue.

217
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:14,950
On your tongue.

218
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,083
I'm gonna suck your beard
and suck your silly little beard.

219
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,683
Oh, my boy is waiting for my beer
to be passed down.

220
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,116
notice.

221
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,250
Oh, hey. Look, it's not for generations,
this beard.

222
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,016
It's nice delivery, OK?

223
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,383
The the Joe, pick up the the flashlight.

224
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,283
I picked up a flashlight.

225
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,683
I have a flashlight.

226
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:33,983
How do I. How do I look?

227
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,050
Laura? Laura, Laura? Laura.

228
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,500
Laura? Yeah, or not? Not really. Laura.

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,733
But it's a collectable.
It's like. Hello, internet.

230
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,233
Welcome to Game. Theory.

231
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,716
Oh, this is like the third one.
I saw this.

232
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:46,000
I can see my legs.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,866
Welcome to the maze survival guide.

234
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:52,400
A complete guide of getting out of a maze
and survival tips of surviving enemies.

00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,366
I met my by Matthew Patrick.

236
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,350
You ever watch where you're lost
in a maze?

237
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,833
You're watching this classified
don't panic.

238
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,266
Have you guys ever seen Hitchhiker's
Guide on the front?

239
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,516
Don't panic. Number two,
I'm. Just a runaway.

240
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,250
Number three, I don't want to.

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,350
Oh, my God. This is
this is fucking amazing.

242
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:10,200
That number. Three,

243
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,650
we just left vox.

244
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,333
We just locked it.

245
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,533
Well, it's a flashlight out.

246
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,733
Something funny
I was reading something funny.

247
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:19,850
Press one

248
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,683
where you can cycle stuff.

249
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,466
Press one to. One.

250
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,150
Wait, hold on. I don't know.

251
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,450
What's the flashlight button.

252
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,366
On the back of the book?
The English is a little broken.

253
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,383
It said that there are no number three.

254
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,483
You arescrewed.

255
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,033

00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:35,933
So I hear they scream already.

257
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,233
Yes. It's my.

258
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,066
One. Now.

259
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:41,433
I don't know.

260
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:43,716
I mean, this is, like
spooky house of jump scares.

261
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,050
I love that game.

262
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,783
I have.

263
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,133
I cleared it, by the way.

264
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,283
You did good for.

265
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,066
This is a small beat.

266
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:52,783
How do you like how do I.

267
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:55,183
Pull out my flashlight
and tell me I to pull out the. Flashlight?

268
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,150
Whine why?

269
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,083
Nobody read.

270
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,966
It. Is a dead
end. Reading's annoying. Yeah.

271
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,450
Pick it up.

272
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,950
Pick what up?

273
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,766

You don't knowshit. You didn't heer that.

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,666
You did't hear anything.

278
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,600
I guess I'm going down this way.

279
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,933
Oh, we should stick together, guys?

280
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,366
I guess I was that way. Guys.

281
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,216
I saw that too.

282
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:29,683
Yo, I stop. I can stop going.

283
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:30,783
Guys, guys, guys.

284
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:32,866
We got to stick together, otherwise.

285
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,750

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,183

Yeah, we saw it.

289
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,900
We saw, like, a demon or something
running through the maze.

290
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,683
The juice about that by the saw.

291
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,566
Just. Oh, like. No, no, no, no, no.

292
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,550
You were behind me when it happened.

Yeah,
I like how you're. I like how your butt.

294
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,850
Wiggles now I feel emasculated.

00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,966
Ooh, yellow.

296
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,650
Like you see it.

297
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,683
Do you see a bite
wiggles? Collectable？

298
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,250
Look back.

299
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,400
You go the wrong way.

300
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm I'm. I'm looking at how.

301
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,633
I. Shot the lesson.

302
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,650
I put out a reference sheet like the.

303
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,016
Oh, yeah, your flat is five and.

304
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,566
Zero k motherfuckers.

305
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:16,300
Zero K when you have no no was like
I do not appreciate everybody

306
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,466
like just staring.

307
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:21,400
It was just like last longer.

308
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,433
 This. Way.

309
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,366
I made it look, dude, if I put a
if I put a balance on the.

310
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,550
It would be like a whole 180 degrees.

311
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,200
Oh, did you guys see that?

312
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,866
Yeah, I sold out.

313
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,300
Oh, yeah.

314
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,983
Shut the fuck up.

315
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,600
Take a break.

316
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,333
Whoever is running around with.

317
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,350
Everybody going.

318
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,183
Creepy, you how about we don't do that?

319
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,366
Thanks. Who wrote. That?

320
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,983
You should take a break. Let's squat.

321
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,233
Oh, you want a squat.

322
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,533
To whoever is running around in the dark?

323
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,383
It's creepy. How about we just don't?

324
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,383
I just don't.

325
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,433
Yeah, it is kind of weird.

326
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,550
You're so it's a mushroom.

327
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,116
So the demon thing,
that's the shade of a shadow

328
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,650
or whatever it is that's running around.

329
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,400
It's not a clue because I saw it
just run straight into a deep end

330
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,916
and straight to a dead
end. And then it disappeared.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
He likes you bagging the mushroom.

332
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,550
Yeah, OK. Anyway, well.

333
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,966
I'll teabag your mushroom in a minute.

334
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,466
Oh, boy. You guys catch me.

335
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,016
Fucking catch me first. Me, get in here.

336
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:15,683
You know

337
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,933
all I know.

338
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:18,700
And I'm

339
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,616
why is there so many ducks?

340
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,300
Like the duck is, like, everywhere.

341
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,800
Is this a theme, man?

342
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,666
When I. Went back.

343
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,733
Went way, I

344
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:32,933

345
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,850
You. Well, you know that.

346
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,050
Oh, not that you guys.

347
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,750
Guys, I think we left Ike

348
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,433
Barton's guys. I think we left.

349
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:48,883
I, i, i i i i'm sorry, ok?

350
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,883

well.

352
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,183
Oh, nice. Ron.

353
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,050
Fox. Like what?

354
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,766
I had to sneeze.

355
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,916
I'm not. Allowed to us these.

356
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:04,816
Women. That's right.

357
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm doing it on this court again.
This motherfucker. Give me a second.

358
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,533
Where are we? We wait.

359
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,450
Are we actually
are we not using ingame voice?

360
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,983
We we're using. End game voice.

361
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,183
We're using game voice.

362
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,883
No, never mind, guys.
He is not muted. Stop.

363
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,850
Yeah, it's double.

364
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,700
It's doubled up.
If I mean, this goes something you gave.

365
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,500
Update it.

366
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,266
Glowsticks made it out.

367
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,950
We already
put your volume to zero, though,

368
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,933
because we want the Fuji thing
to light up.

369
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:29,466
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh.

370
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,366
Oh, I get it.

371
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,616
I'll tell you, you're. A smart boy.

372
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,200
Thank you.

373
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,383
I was down here
this is like a little fight

374
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,566
about a fighter,
but it is this like a we can crawl inside.

375
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,466
I'll know. What the fuck.

376
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,900
I'll call inside. You crawl inside.

377
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,983
All over.

378
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,616
That's that's a lot to fit inside. OK?

379
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,266
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.

380
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,216
I get that a lot amount.

381
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,100
What is this, like a underground mine?

382
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,550
Are we going to the mines?

383
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,983
No, I believe it's just.
All right. We have officially entered the.

384
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,000
This is our last two.
This feels like Alice.

385
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,383
All right,
so it's not scary, then. Gotcha.

386
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:08,716
Yeah. What, you weren't that scared by it?

387
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,566
Nah. Last two is mostly
just kind of gross.

388
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:12,466
It was.

389
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,333
It's very gory and dark.

390
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,733
It's very gory, very gross.
But it wasn't really that scary.

391
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,650
My favourite part was at the beginning,

392
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,833
there was one dude who ran away
from the crowd like he was after me.

393
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,600
And then suddenly he turned around
and he ran away,

394
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,816
and he just kind of, like, crouched over
and ran away, like, smuggle it.

395
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,700
Maybe it made me laugh quite a bit.

396
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,383
In the first part, they were there.

397
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,633
The word was on the statues, deeper
in the maze.

398
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,283
It's L, so begins with E.

399
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,850
Are ha got it?

400
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,533
Had to shift some stones. With E.

401
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:41,450
And there is. What the hell's
the password?

402
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,966
Giant maze open for me.

403
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,133
Maybe there's a clue somewhere

404
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,133
like open sesame.

405
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,283
Also, I believe we've lost our friends.
Well, yeah.

406
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:51,683
I thought there.

407
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:53,566
Oh I hear them remove. Remove.

408
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,883
Hello them behind for you.

409
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
Yeah. I've just progressed.

410
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,733
Where hazing you. This is how you get used
to this experience.

411
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,833
OK, also congratulations for beating 52.

412
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,450
That's a difficult game.

413
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,866
Oh, you bet.

414
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,500
Yeah, I was there one and a half
and I was, I was like cheering.

415
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,900
It was great. It was. Amazing.
You did so well.

416
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,100
Honestly, I was so proud.

417
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,800
That game night
while that game took me a while to be.

418
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,483
The sixth night, though.

419
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh, my God. Oh, my. God.

420
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,000
I had to shift some stone plates
around to get this thing working.

421
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,950
Now, what the hell's the password?

422
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,900
Giant maze open for me.

423
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,100
Maybe there's a clue. Some it somewhere.

424
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,950
We had to look for clues. I am the best.

425
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,533
I know.

426
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:33,733
We can't move it right now,
but the code begins with E and ends an s.

427
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:35,983
Eggs.

428
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,566
You're a funny fucking guy.

429
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,883
No, no. We got a real fucking comedian
way home.

430
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,300
Oh, it's one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

431
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,450
Yes, a q. It's nine letters long.

432
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,750
Has a Q after that.

433
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,733
What was the first and last letter again?

434
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,866
Equality is the first letter and then the
second letter, but we can't read.

435
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,300
So a share.

436
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,516
No, it's just. Uh.

437
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,883
What? Oh. Oh, I.

438
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:04,900
Oh, no.

439
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,166
What? Oh, my God.

440
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,850
What will happen alone?

441
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,000
Hey, guys, I'm scared.
What happened over here?

442
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,833
Well, by.

443
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,766
Itself, it was through my screen and went.

444
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:13,900
Boom,

445
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:16,783
no one boom vine boom.

446
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,100
Like a vine. Boom.

447
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,433
Yeah, like a vine boom.

448
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh, my. Oh, I didn't save it.

449
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,566
I don't know.

450
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:25,483
I got to I put the phone app to JavaScript
sound of my dogs la

451
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:26,833
the other day, and I forgot to save it.

452
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,266
I think I got jump scared by tech soccer.

453
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm not going to allow. What

454
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,100
hey, guys.

455
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,033
I see.

456
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,233
Oh, wait. You guys hear that?

457
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,500
I just heard someone breathing.
Something is breathing around me.

458
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,850
I don't. Know.
Why are we heading towards the ghost?

459
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,033
Why are we wanting to. Face.

460
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,750
I heard of creepy.
There's a fucking tricycle there.

461
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,583
They're laughing out for a ride,
guys. I'll be it.

462
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,116
Is the shining.

463
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,366
Yo, I don't think we should head
towards. The ghost.

464
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,716
Noise. Oh, my God.

465
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:56,000
Somebody. Somebody ran to the side.
They went ooga booga.

466
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,400
Somebody went down that way.

467
00:20:58,433 --> 00:20:59,200
Somebody will

468
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:02,116
it's like, well, that's.

469
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,066
Close to an adult male.

470
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,866
Adult male male.

471
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,933
Seven has removed all the teeth.

472
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,083
Everything's just. OK.

473
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,733
They had a man that's information.

474
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,200
Mark Oh, this way,
this way, this way. This.

475
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,233
This is where they went, though.
This is where the ghost ran to.

476
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,933
Yeah, exactly. So we're chasing the.

477
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:17,600
Ghost thing, which.

478
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,133
Is how all the sights
I mean, the the how do.

479
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,350
I don't think this is, like, fisma phobia.

480
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,216
Hello?

481
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,150
Is there, like, a. Limit in the.

482
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,666
I think we're supposed to use the ghost.
They will find our way.

483
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,250
Yeah. Yeah,
I think. My God, we all thank you.

484
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,800
Thank you. Yeah,
I forgot about the guys. Guys, it's guys.

485
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,783
I found the. Oh,
my team were full of idiots.

486
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,100
Well, it's a big bone, really.

487
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,033
This thing. This thing does. It's a bone.
And it also it does that kind of stuff.

488
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:40,400
It looks.

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,583
Like.

490
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,783
Oh, hi, h this is Officer Frank Mills.

491
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,550
My boy Robert's been missing
for nearly two days now.

492
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:51,583
We're not moving fast enough.

493
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,050
I'm taking it on myself
to get through this damn gate.

494
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:56,233
Find where is hiding in this fucking maze?

495
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,400
This should help me keep evidence.

496
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,183
Anyways.

497
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,850
That's a

498
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,000
boner.

499
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,900
It's ominous.

500
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:12,400
Did you guys heard the audio tape right.

501
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,033
Yeah, I heard. It.
I didn't hear any of that.

502
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,766
Oh, you didn't really?

503
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:16,450
Oh, no.

504
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,883
Yeah, no,
I heard something, but it was super quiet.

505
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,500
Oh, wow.

506
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,083
So a boy got lost.

507
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,483
You know, and got lost.

508
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,516
Then he's in these fields. Shit.

509
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:30,233
So fields of.

510
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,633
Green opening up here.

511
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:32,416
At least

512
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,333
oh, there's a shadow.

513
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,366
This is the safe house.

514
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,300
Oh, like this.

515
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh, I hear music come from it.

516
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,966
Creepy arse. Music. There's music.

517
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:43,816
And like, a lot of religious things,
then it's a safe house.

518
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,433
Nice. It sounds like little nightmares.

519
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,000
Kind of.

520
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,916
Somebody's having a bad day down here.

521
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,150
Reminder to self.

522
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,800
Give them some space.

523
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,866
This is a creepy arse folk music. Yeah.

524
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,150
It reminds me of the little nightmares
theme.

525
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,866
You know, I'm

526
00:22:58,116 --> 00:22:58,750
on some sort of.

527
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,833
Method of mechanism.

528
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,600
So dark hair
and you get the whole thing glowing.

529
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,233
What if controls anything

530
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:07,516
OK? Oh, checkpoint.

531
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,100
Checkpoint. Hey, we got a checkpoint.

532
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

533
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,650
Mechanism is

534
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,333
just sort of mechanism mechanisms
to get the whole thing going.

535
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:20,416
One of the controls, anything?

536
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
Nothing else. You

537
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,450
gain here is tweaking, working.

538
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,316
Thought he was looking now.

539
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:32,866
Tweaking, but he was looking right at me.

540
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,633
But I just froze up and he wandered away.

541
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:38,983
Note to calls called someone to come
get this guy when I saw this,

542
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,933
and I just froze up and he wandered away.

543
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,633
So that's highlighted.

544
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,216
So if you guys see anybody.

545
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,450
Don't move.

546
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,033
All OK? Why?
Oh, that's all. Well, that's a hint.

547
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,000
OK, so if we see a.

548
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,850
Ghost I don't. Know.

549
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,050
I didn't get the hint.

550
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,233
If we see a ghost,
do not move and don't see anything.

551
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:00,133
Am I the only one
that's using the glow sticks?

552
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,933
Yes. Oh, yes. Walls and.

553
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:04,666
Oh, it says a. Bunch of statues.
About this find the.

554
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,583
Labels are ruined, but a few of them
still have letters remaining.

555
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,983
Hello?

556
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,733
Oh, pow, pow. Wow.

557
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:15,350
Well, what.

558
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,366
Am I, dead

559
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,283
by man?

560
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:26,716
I'm dead. I'm dead, too.

561
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,116
I am on the ground. Ike,
you got to pick me. Oh, someone.

562
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:32,350
Oh, don't don't pick me up
like I picked me out.

563
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:33,583
You'll get it.

564
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,750
Get the fuck out of here first.

565
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,283
OK, pick me up.

566
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:41,716
Hello? I'm about to die.

567
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:43,666
I'm bleeding out. I'm bleeding out.
I'm bleeding out. I'm bleeding.

568
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,383
Oh, my God. I'm dead.

569
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:48,550
He always got me I'm revived now I'm dead.

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
All thank you.

571
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,150
Sorry. I thought I could.

572
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,800
I couldn't speak.

573
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,033
I did speak either.

574
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,400
This bitch is still screaming like hell.

575
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
All I think boxes

576
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,516
that we can go back
and get them in there on the safe house.

577
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,983
Oh, so I guess so
I just so I just wait. You die.

578
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,633
You just kind. Of come back.

579
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,700
Yeah, we turned off her body.

580
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,850
Just a bit after that.

581
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,350
After I was.

582
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,116
I was right back.

583
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:19,150
That, like,
the fact that both walks and shot

584
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,000
are just the hand on the paper
just went completely out the window.

585
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:26,083
So I just stood there and watched
you two get mangled.

586
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,366
No, I just. Yeah, you know what happened?

587
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:31,033
I wish she was, like,
helping us like this motherfucker.

588
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,233
No, look.

589
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,183
I heard whispering,

590
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:38,083
like, right deep into my left
ear canal, and I panicked the fuck out.

591
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,450
I thought something was on my arse
and I was dead anyways,

592
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,866
but that was right in front of us.

593
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:44,116
And Vasari like a bomb.

594
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:45,683
Oh. I did, I did.

595
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:48,766
I saw the I saw, like,
the dude, like, kissing your soul

596
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,633
oh. Well, OK.

597
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,100
So now we know what to do, at least.

598
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,816
Yeah, let's not let's not scream.

599
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:58,216
Not whatever you guys did.

600
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm sorry.

601
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
I think there's a.

602
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Bunch of statues back this way.

603
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,533
Labels are ruined, but a few of them
still have some letters remaining.

604
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:10,150
OK, so this one says e u e,
but imagine this is the first clue.

605
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,900
This is the first three letters
of the three guys.

606
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,316
Yeah. Oh,

607
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:22,366
go. Help, help, help! Oh!

608
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,883
Oh, no.

609
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, God.

610
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
The way guys.

611
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,733
My bleed Alzheimer I bleed out timer.

612
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,150
Oh, no.

613
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,266
Oh, he was.

614
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,833
I'm very pretty.

615
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,450
Probably guys going to I oh.

616
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,150
I could be OK.

617
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,833
I think it's because of his socks.

618
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,283
Oh, no, I'm that.

619
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,316
I'm that.

620
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,516
The end endgame voice.

621
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,483
I was like in between Ike's legs there.

622
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,166
What the fuck was that?

623
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,300
Oh, OK.

624
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,033
All over were liver

625
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,650
I'm alone now, I think.

626
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,366
No, you're not.

627
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:13,700
Oh, hey, what's up, demons?

628
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,533
It's me.

629
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,916
Yeah, boy.

630
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:17,866
It got.

631
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,650
OK, which one's the lights? Sticks.

632
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,716
I got to use the light sixes.

633
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:23,433
Well, number two is to be

634
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,933
lost. You're going to get us killed.

635
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,000
So you just got killed.

636
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,733
Oh, wow.

637
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,716
We're back.

638
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:30,983
Speaking.

639
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:33,350
Audio.

640
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,450
Audio jungle time.

641
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,533
You turn your rules away.

642
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,300
Shut the fuck up, British.

643
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,700
Shut up, British.

644
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:47,500
Because of what Virginia all spoke.

645
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,933
Where? The spoons in here.

646
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,083
Shut up, British.

647
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,483
I like that one with ghosts.

648
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,333
I know how to deal with ghosts.

649
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,683
I found out. I found a little.

650
00:27:57,683 --> 00:27:59,183
I found a puzzle area.

651
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:00,833
Why was this puzzle. Huh?

652
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:03,500
Oh, no.

653
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,700
There's just me and you guys now.

654
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:08,533
What is this?

655
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,183
This mechanism looks old.

656
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:14,683
I thought Johnny set this up with a fair
can afford this kind of budget.

657
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,933
A Jason. One.

658
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, hello.

659
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,166
Hello.

660
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,433
Oh, it's like it's one of.

661
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,933
These puzzles

662
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:36,800
ok. OK, ok.

663
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,250
All right.

664
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,583
Well, I think I need my friends
for this one, so I'm going to go back

665
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:44,300
and get my friends,
or I could just solve it on my own. Why?

666
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,333
I don't want to do that.
I will look for them.

667
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,933
Hey, it's my first time.

668
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,933
Who's ever said that to me?

669
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,133
I found a. Puzzle.

670
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,033
You a puzzle? Yeah. And bass.

671
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,833
If you ever play heroes of or watch,
it's like it's similar.

672
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,150
It's like you press one symbol,
and then the surrounding symbols light up.

673
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,933
So you got to like, oh.

674
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,816
Like you to use my glow stick.

675
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:06,850
Oh, I get it. I get. It. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,716
I don't.

677
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:13,816
You have to, like, look, glow them all out
glow them a lot, I think.

678
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:17,450
I think you got some either Jago them
all out is what I'm thinking right now.

679
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:20,900
OK, so give me a second.

680
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,650
I happen to be standing here
which set off enough stuff.

681
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,483
Or maybe you all glow.

682
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:26,750
I don't. Johnny set this up.

683
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,500
No way.

684
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,450
And the fair
can afford this kind of budget.

685
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,616
We can change
the colours of our Glowsticks.

686
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:35,633
See a Jason.

687
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,000
OK, I get how it works.

688
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,233
Now, when you step on a tile,
it highlights everything

689
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:44,716
that is adjacent
on, like the X and y axis.

690
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,316
Mm hmm.

691
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,466
So not diagonal.
Yeah, only z, our x and y.

692
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:50,983
So we have to, like,
make it all glow. I think

693
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:53,333
seems right.

694
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah, we can go. Yeah.

695
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,566
Hold on, everybody step off them.

696
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,300
And, like, let's think about this.

697
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,400
I want to. It's OK. So wait.

698
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,633
And if I fill them off,
put them that are mine.

699
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:11,800
So OK.

700
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,283
So now most of them are off.

701
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:15,850
Yeah, most of them are off now.

702
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,616
OK, let's pick this one.

703
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,750
That turns that one off.

704
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,483
Know you play a bunch of puzzle
games earlier.

705
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:26,200
I think you have the, you know, the
the brain folds for this one, right?

706
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:29,350
I that's why. Perhaps.

707
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,033
I heard something

708
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,116
was I.

709
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,350
Know that's me stepping on the.

710
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,200
Fucking box doing weird sounds.

711
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,033
Right?

712
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,083
I thought it was a.

713
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:45,950
Somebody
walking around on the puzzle pieces.

714
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,033
Sorry. I yeah.

715
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:47,983
That's what's.

716
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,200
Happening.

717
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:51,916
Is blowing vox meteor.

718
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,516
T y you
mean main stream, the way you named it.

719
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,900
You are terrifying
when you walk up in from my face.

720
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,683
You know that.

721
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:01,516
Oh, my God.

722
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:03,316
If I go too close to you
like your eyeballs,

723
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:06,316
I can see I can just cut through your head
and see your eyeballs.

724
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:07,633
I can smell your hair.

725
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,150
If I do that. It should turn up.

726
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,466
It smells like. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

727
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,383
What is it about these inexpensive steam
ghost.

728
00:31:15,783 --> 00:31:16,116
Left.

729
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:17,633
Have such funny characterised.

730
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,450
Some form of phobia to use as a glitch.

731
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,350
Ghost?

732
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,650
I think.

733
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,883
I think Ghost Hunter Core is my favourite
one with the way that they just kind of

734
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,500
have their arms hanging by their sides.

735
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,583
And they walk slowly.
They just look really funny.

736
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,666
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

737
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:35,050
I see the equation.

738
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,200
No, I don't. Oh, you're so close.

739
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,450
Are we?

740
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,133
Are we ok? OK. OK.

741
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,733
This is. All. Worn.

742
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,050
This one out.

743
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,416
I think we have to be such here

744
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,850
and here.

745
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:58,700
Here and here and then.

746
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,733
Oh, you're close.

747
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,933
You're close.

748
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,783
Middle one middle, one middle, one metre,
one middle.

749
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:07,183
You got a middle one.

750
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:08,750
But no, no.

751
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,083
I'm different weight. I'm stupid.

752
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,466
Ignore me. Ignore me.

753
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:13,183
I'm a minute.

754
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

755
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:22,733
And and then

756
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:25,900
after that. We have to.

757
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,883
Turn them all on.

758
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:30,983
If we can highlight
only the corners we win

759
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,550
wait.

760
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,333
I think I have an idea. I have an idea.

761
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, OK.

762
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,016
Shit.

763
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,483
No, wait, wait, wait.

764
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:53,450
Do you see it? You see it?

765
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:56,500
No, not quite.

766
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,266
If I do
that, then we get to those corners.

767
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,966
And if I do this,

768
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,300
we get those corners

769
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,533
it's just that thing in the middle.

770
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,800
Where's Box?

771
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,866
Oh, my God. He's here. Three.

772
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:15,916
Yeah, he said.

773
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,483
I. I'm chilling in the corner because
this puzzle is genuinely beyond me.

774
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:21,650
I'm really bad at these.

775
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,133
We got to get the ones
to light up in the corners first.

776
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,816
Yeah. Prioritise that. Yeah.

777
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,733
1000, oh.

778
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:30,800
Wait, wait, wait.

779
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,183
Hold on. I think I know, I know.

780
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah, yeah.

781
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Can somebody step in the middle.

782
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,850
Of the middle? Hold on, hold on, hold on.

783
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,766
No, no, never mind.

784
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,833
It was a good idea.

785
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,883
Oh, OK.

786
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:51,016
Not now. We're all stepping on them.
Hold on, hold on.

787
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:51,983
Well, I'm so sorry.

788
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:54,200
Yeah, yeah. Hold on for a second. OK.

789
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,050
Uh, I just want to see if I can.

790
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:57,950
How do I.

791
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,166
I want to get this.

792
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:03,250
OK. OK, and then

793
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,783
only and so on. Stepped on the middle.

794
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,616
Hold on. Fuck.

795
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,233
I'll step on you.

796
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,216
I think I saw it for a second.

797
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,850
Because I want these to light up.

798
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,500
And then no.

799
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,133
It was close.

800
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:24,466
Fuck. OK, I have an idea. Hold on.

801
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:26,600
If everybody could, like,

802
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,166
step away from the tiles,
I want to see if I can try something.

803
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,866
OK. Well.

804
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,133
Ok. So

805
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:38,233
I figured out that these

806
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,750
the corners work that way.

807
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,916
Oh, oh, oh, that's it.

808
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,516
Oh, yeah. That was all.

809
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:54,083
I was nice hey, smart car.

810
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:55,966
Smart.

811
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:58,183
Smart cookie.

812
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,950
Oh, my god.

813
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,500
I was pretty good.

814
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,350
Know I was about of girl
that when the teacher says

815
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,533
find a duet partner
for this work a bit like I.

816
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:09,550
Don't.

817
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:15,233
And then we
just have to pick out with someone stupid.

818
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,283
I guess I'll just go with shuttle.

819
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,283
I'm stupid. Yeah.

820
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,500
Yeah, you are.

821
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

822
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:26,850
Where the fuck we do?

823
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,600
They leave.

824
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:29,483
What?

825
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,383
Well, OK.

826
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:33,250
OK, then.

827
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,416
I guess we are, huh?

828
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,150
Guys, what the fuck?

829
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,500
Why'd you leave us? Come on, keep up.

830
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:41,550
Keep on trying and trying.

831
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,750
Trying. Right?

832
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,850
That's a really dark like.

833
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,866
And this one. Also.

834
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:50,150
It's a long and dark.

835
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:51,983
I really. Like.

836
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,733
So why? Why?

837
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,533
I heard something.

838
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:01,033
Or something,
but it was not in front of my face.

839
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,083
Low facts that, like,
when you when you go into the trees,

840
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,566
you can still move like
a completely unencumbered movement speed.

841
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,366
So it's like you just like. Yeah, yeah.

842
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,250
When you're talking.
And then you walk into the, oh.

843
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:14,300
Yeah.

844
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm going to be the first time
you walk into a bush wooded box.

845
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,050
Oh, we're back now. Now, listen, Michael.

846
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:21,083
What do you mean? Easy. Wait.

847
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,383
So important lesson put the glowsticks.

848
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,900
Over back here, OK?

849
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,866
Oh, no, thank you.

850
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:30,250
He q you is a IQ. Yeah.

851
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,633
I'm his. Equations.

852
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,216
Is that it? Equations?

853
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:37,850
Oh, I thought it was equations,
but it's one little short. Oh.

854
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,333
Equestrian.

855
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,816
A hunger.

856
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:45,466
Equal equal.

857
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:46,966
Equal y.

858
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,133
Equals equal.

859
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,833
You're the one that ask
what's the who's a lie?

860
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,616
Oh, he was misled.

861
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:57,300
Never mind that young demon slayer.

862
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:59,450
He grew on me like he was E.coli.

863
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,366
And I was British beef at room
temperature.

864
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,800
Equinox guy.

865
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,183
You know, stupidity, though.

866
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:06,350
Alba Knox.

867
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,266
Albert Knox.

868
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,633
I assure you can do this

869
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,050
at trying to find a cure for like.

870
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,033
What was the letters on the statue again?

871
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:16,700
I don't remember.

872
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,533
Listen, listen.

873
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:20,833
I'm slightly I'm slightly tipsy
and my eyes are full of tears.

874
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,216
I'm doing my best.

875
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:24,616
So I'm going to give you a clip.

876
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,933
I missed it again. Yeah.

877
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,833
And you want to wipe your shirt
on top of your chair?

878
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,850
So my shirt.

879
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,466
What? You.

880
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:35,750
L. L.

881
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,333
L. What the fuck is.

882
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,766
Wrong with you? I'm offering.

883
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:40,850
What's what's that?

884
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,133
Why is it always at all
kind of, like, patchy in some places.

885
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:44,566
I've had dried semen.

886
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,933
But you. You are.

887
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,616
You are.

888
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,683
You know, that's a lot of myself.

889
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:51,550
I'm not sure that.

890
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,466
You are such a. Bastard. Man.

891
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,900
You know what you're facing at this point?

892
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,816
We have me and I. Got the exact same shit.

893
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,050
What the hell are you talking about?

894
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,883
Well, fine.

895
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:05,633
You want me to.

896
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:06,983
Oh, it's with.

897
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:08,483
Oh, OK. Give me a second.

898
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:11,483
I think I messed up with this one. Yes.

899
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,600
I was doing that.

900
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,700
Why did you why did you eat this?

901
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:20,350
So equal sign equally.

902
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:24,050
E and you. Okay.

903
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,950
Oh, my goodness.

904
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,950
Oh, we should go back inside.

905
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,466
I don't like the little wiggle
that you deal when you're like.

906
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,183
Yeah, why is. It like, I'm slow?

907
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,266
Why is it why is it working?

908
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,450
Like my camera
when I was doing my cooking,

909
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,233
which is slowly bouncing over my kitchen
counter, hmm.

910
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,233
OK, ok. OK. We're done with this.

911
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,050
No, don't move anything.

912
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,366
I just want to see.

913
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,466
OK, I'll be right back.

914
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:52,216
I'm going I'm going to head back into
the maze real quick and just take a look.

915
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:53,333
Are you trying to put in?

916
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,083
So I'll be there.

917
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,133
I just want to. See the way.

918
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,216
You maybe spelled it now. OK,

919
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,650
no chat it's just me and you guys missing.

920
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,716
Yeah,

921
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,750
I'm just kidding.

922
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,100
I actually.

923
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Do you want to go back into the maze
and look for any other clues?

924
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,716
Because it seems like
we're missing something

925
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:16,216
it feels like it might not be a word.

926
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:18,216
Like if it feels like
it might not be a word

927
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,200
and it might just be like
a jumble of letters,

928
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,283
and it's just trying to give us
the illusion.

929
00:39:22,283 --> 00:39:24,200
It's an actual word.

930
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,750
So that's why we're going to head back
over here and take a look

931
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,983
this is a solo mission.

932
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,850
I think I can still hear
the voices of the gamers,

933
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:38,466
and that will optimise with the
what's it called with the audio it's

934
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,633
it seems

935
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,833
this thing's looking at me.

936
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,700
Why are you looking at me?

937
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:51,383
Hello, Oh,

938
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,833
oh, OK.

939
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:00,250
Well.

940
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,766
Ah, well,

941
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,466
it might be about time

942
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:08,933
while we get the fuck out.

943
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:26,116
I think OK.

944
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,816
OK, we're fine.

945
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:31,483
We're fine. Right.

946
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,466
Don't move.

947
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:34,433
No, it's ok.

948
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,383
It's OK.

949
00:40:43,650 --> 00:41:05,033
No, there's nothing.

950
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,366
I got nothing out of this.

951
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:08,700
What the fuck?

952
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,166
Actually got.

953
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,066
Nothing.

954
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:23,000
Sounds outside that as well.

955
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, my God. Wait. I think I'm lost.

956
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,716
Oh, no, wait. How do I.

957
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:30,583
Is it blocked off?

958
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:32,266
Wait, is it blocked off?

959
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:32,800
Oh, my God.

960
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,483
It's blocked off.

961
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:36,350
Oh, my God.

962
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,050
Guys, I'm actually way.

963
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,300
Oh, fuck.

964
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,333
That's bad.

965
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:48,683
Help!

966
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,900
Help!

967
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:19,250
Help!

968
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,183
Help! Someone!

969
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:21,083
Someone send help!

970
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,033
Guys, guys. Somebody's going to. That.

971
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:24,166
I need help.

972
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:24,833
I don't know.

973
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,750
Is he is he going to

974
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,766
Oh, no.

975
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:44,783
Oh, no.

976
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:48,500
I said not to move, so I didn't move. Oh,

977
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,650
no, no, no.

978
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,966
Oh, shit.

979
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,133
Oh, my God. That's bad.

980
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:04,966
Hang it.

981
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,633
Fuck! No.

982
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,983
Oh, I died.

983
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:20,500
Too. There was no good clues.

984
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,850
I'm so confused.

985
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,666
I got wrecked by the monster.

986
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,566
I Sierra.

987
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,850
I don't like the way he looks.

988
00:43:31,966 --> 00:43:34,483
Creatures terrifying.

989
00:43:42,700 --> 00:44:06,316
You are

990
00:44:22,966 --> 00:44:25,650
maybe I go down this way instead, right?

991
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,800
Oh, my God. I'm lost. I'm so lost.

992
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,583
I'm so lost.

993
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm so lost.

994
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,583
And I get the fuck away from him

995
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,016
where I'm at.

996
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:39,350
I actually

997
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:41,833
flew.

998
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,966
I found another clue. Oh, my God.

999
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:44,866
It was worth it.

1000
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:46,133
Holy shit. It was worth it.

1001
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:46,750
It was worth it.

1002
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,733
X, x x.

1003
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,566
Yes, ok. OK.

1004
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:51,133
Oh, my God.

1005
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,300
I got to help him, dude.

1006
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,383
I got to go back and tell them

1007
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,450
that I

1008
00:44:58,216 --> 00:44:58,750
please.

1009
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,883
Please don't die. Please don't
I please don't. I need. I have.

1010
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:10,516
To. This is a vital it's a vital clue.

1011
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,616
What the hell, man?

1012
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,250
You know,

1013
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,900
oh, my God.

1014
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,200
I hate it. I hate it so much.

1015
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,366
I hate it so much.

1016
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,033
Maybe there's another clue back here.

1017
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:52,866
E q you and axes

1018
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:10,316
if both.

1019
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:14,066
Oh! Ow!

1020
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,800
Oh, it hurt me.

1021
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,483
Oh, my God.

1022
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,833
The ghost the fucking ghost heard me talk.

1023
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:19,750
Oh, my God.

1024
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,900
I'm so damn oh.

1025
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,250
Oh, my fault uses them.

1026
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,333
They use. I forgot it uses my microphone.

1027
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,350
A jar.

1028
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,450
Godzilla, Ant-Man.

1029
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:38,800
Oh, all right.

1030
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,966
All right. OK, ok, ok. OK.

1031
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,483
All this.

1032
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:45,933
If I can make it back,
I need to make it back.

1033
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:52,550
Hello.

1034
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,933
There he is. I found the clue.

1035
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:55,750
I found another clue.

1036
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,900
Where is it? I've.

1037
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,033
Ah, it's the last part of the.

1038
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,750
It's X.

1039
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,250
Yes, it's the last three letters are x s.

1040
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:03,800
Yeah.

1041
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,500
It has to be for the latter. Or something.

1042
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,266
I think so. Yeah.

1043
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:09,800
So the first 23 letters are

1044
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:14,866
I. Yeah,

1045
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,850
why me?

1046
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,733
All right.

1047
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:50,750
I lied.

1048
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:53,716
I didn't do anything.

1049
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:56,950
I didn't do anything.

1050
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,600
Well, I can crawl.

1051
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,866
I can crawl

1052
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,066
all right.

1053
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:14,250
I think I got

1054
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:22,366
oh, Robert, fuck me.

1055
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,033
Fuck me. My

1056
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:29,450
I can't believe I just said all right.

1057
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,466
I think we're good in that.

1058
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:31,300
I got it.

1059
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,050
Listen, sometimes

1060
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,083
in life,
we can feel like there's no way out, OK?

1061
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,250
You're a sheep trapped in a maze.

1062
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,700
You're back. Oh.

1063
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,200
Designed by wolves.

1064
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,916
OK, I got you on

1065
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,700
oh. Fuck me.

1066
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:17,483
But in a maze like that,
there's always two doors to choose from.

1067
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,333
And behold, one of those doors is all the
sweets and confectionary you can imagine.

1068
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,066
Fantastic.

1069
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,966
How come you bring this oh, no.

1070
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:46,750
Oh. L.A.

1071
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,883
fan to McDonald's.

1072
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:52,550
Burger King
but there's also another burger block.

1073
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,000
A Burger King Doyle.
Not a fan, not a friend.

1074
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,866
The door is another door.

1075
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:59,483
Another door is harder to get through. Oh,

1076
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:00,850
if you want

1077
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,016
to hazard a guess,
what's on the other side of that door?

1078
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,883
You know,
I think it's alerted by the flock

1079
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,983
oh. Backing up.

1080
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:24,766
I'm backing up.

1081
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:25,816
I'm backing the fuck up.

1082
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:29,050
Anyways,
I think it got alerted to anything.

1083
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,100
Do you
do you do anything except back it up?

1084
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,900
I thrust forward.

1085
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,550
Oh, really? When, when, when?

1086
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,300
Right now.

1087
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,616
You look who's in front of me right now.
Look who's in front me right now.

1088
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,450
I think I like that.

1089
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,316
Whatever, OK?

1090
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:48,650
I think that somebody has to activate
because I managed to get past him,

1091
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:50,116
but I heard you guys getting slaughtered.

1092
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:51,700
It's I came back for you.

1093
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,933
I had. To recite an entire passage
from one to the.

1094
00:50:53,933 --> 00:50:55,816
World of the. Soul. OK.

1095
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:58,366
Another five if boxing show for time.

1096
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:00,233
I'm not going to lie
here's what I was doing.

1097
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:02,833
I was standing behind Vox
and I was flickering my flashlight on

1098
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,300
and off,
and I heard that. And he attacked.

1099
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:12,683
Oh, god.

1100
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:18,050
Oh. So

1101
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,333
you see, the first time.

1102
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,000
The first time I approached that door,
I thought it must be Jesus.

1103
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,250
On the other side, it's
not Jesus, it's another door.

1104
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,050
Where He wants to take the guests away

1105
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,283
from the other side of that door.

1106
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:40,783
I'm dead.

1107
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:42,583
Yes. Jesus.

1108
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,950
OK. OK.

1109
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,616
Well, hello.

1110
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:56,266
OK, good.

1111
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:59,066
We got it. Seems like we're good.

1112
00:51:59,066 --> 00:51:59,783
I think so.

1113
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,350
I know I am.

1114
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:05,716
Are you guys hanging in the trees?

1115
00:52:06,516 --> 00:52:07,233
Hello?

1116
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:09,766
Hello. I'm

1117
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,400
I know.

1118
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,083
Where I am.

1119
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,333
Standing cowardly.

1120
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:19,483
Welcome back.

1121
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,216
Is there anyone I might. Come back. To?

1122
00:52:22,216 --> 00:52:23,150
Uh, ok.

1123
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,250
I think we need to go over here.

1124
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,783
We never made a pass here.

1125
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:30,100
If you go down there, I think you find us.

1126
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,633
I'm pretty sure that's where I found it.

1127
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,650
Yeah, if you had down here, I think.

1128
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,466
I don't know if there's any other.

1129
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:44,016
Paths

1130
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:46,600
is there another path.

1131
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,700
And see us?

1132
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,900
Yeah. And there's these statues.

1133
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:52,500
Yeah. Yeah,

1134
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:56,033
that one got me to

1135
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:57,916
hell. Yeah.

1136
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,650
A little jump

1137
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:03,850
all right, you little.

1138
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:14,750
Man. I'm dead.

1139
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,983
I can't pay electric bill.

1140
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:24,883
Isn't fucked up.

1141
00:53:24,883 --> 00:53:27,233
I'm laughing. I don't know

1142
00:53:28,483 --> 00:53:29,983
where are they?

1143
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:39,066
Oh, no.

1144
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,533
Like they told you.

1145
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,800
Tell you to, like, stand still,
but doesn't

1146
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,183
really work.

1147
00:53:48,883 --> 00:53:51,250
Like, works when it feels like it.

1148
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,833
Oh, crawl to me.

1149
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,183
I can't see anything.

1150
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:56,683
I don't know where you are.

1151
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:06,016
Man. I'm dead

1152
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:07,450
or I got less.

1153
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,166
I gotcha, gotcha and less.

1154
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:09,583
And unless.

1155
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,850
Yeah, you're not dying on me.

1156
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,033
Oh, dude, you're huge. Huge.

1157
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:15,800
Are you in the eye? I am sorry, folks.

1158
00:54:16,183 --> 00:54:17,200
Welcome back.

1159
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:19,083
I'm sorry.

1160
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:21,833
Like, are you in the bushes right now? I

1161
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:27,016
a friend for years in the bushes.

1162
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,000
That's not got someplace else.

1163
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,783
Like, a long way.

1164
00:54:34,783 --> 00:54:35,800
That's a very bad idea.

1165
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,150
Let's go back how we go back. OK.

1166
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,383
Do you guys know the way back?

1167
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,783
Where do we go?

1168
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:42,700
I'm just going to go this way.

1169
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,150
I think it might be fun.

1170
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:46,900
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Sounds good to me.

1171
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,450
I really. I really enjoyed the first one.

1172
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,516
I really enjoyed that experience
because we just walked out and we saw

1173
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:55,683
you two walk out and your character model
just begins again.

1174
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:59,266
Oh, this is the axis area for

1175
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,000
you guys.

1176
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,450
Just scared me, so. Yeah, no, that was.

1177
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:07,183
Nothing in this game. It scared me so far.

1178
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,400
Oh, my

1179
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,633
dear one.

1180
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:11,966
I got scared by. He did.

1181
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:13,133
She did a little jump.

1182
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:15,200
But when he saw I was so adorable.

1183
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,400
I said I didn't even know
you could jump in this game.

1184
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,616
The XY is at the end.

1185
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:23,533
We already were here.

1186
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,350
No, it's just me to get past the dude,
you know.

1187
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,166
Really?

1188
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:35,050
It's like the moment you hear him,

1189
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:38,416
you don't really have a choice.

1190
00:55:39,283 --> 00:55:40,800
When I got you.

1191
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh, poor Vox.

1192
00:55:43,516 --> 00:55:46,333
The zam ification.

1193
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,150
All right, grandpa, where are you?

1194
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,600
What do

1195
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,483
oh, this is bad.

1196
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,750
Oh, that's not good.

1197
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:08,833
It's damned if you do.

1198
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,683
Damned if you don't.

1199
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:12,016
If you don't move
and he walks into you, you're dead.

1200
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,983
And if you move to get stand
out of the way,

1201
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,250
you're dead.

1202
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,683
That's all I have, like, 3 seconds.

1203
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:26,150
Thank you.

1204
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,666
Holding. Oh.

1205
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:36,433
Love oh,

1206
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:38,300
my God.

1207
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,150
We are three people.

1208
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,050
Hello?

1209
00:56:45,316 --> 00:56:48,166
To all

1210
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:12,966
kinds ok.

1211
00:57:13,483 --> 00:57:15,433
OK. Where the wait.
Where's where's the way out?

1212
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,300
Where's the way up on the sound?

1213
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,400
Here is not the way

1214
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:20,883
you would go down.

1215
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,633
We let's to go down this way.

1216
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:24,383
That's where you went. Exactly.

1217
00:57:24,383 --> 00:57:26,033
That's where we have to go, though.

1218
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:26,983
And we turn here.

1219
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:27,833
I think.

1220
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:30,700
You and I don't think.

1221
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:32,600
This is look familiar.

1222
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,966
I think
I think you need to hide in the bushes

1223
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:37,816
yeah.

1224
00:57:37,816 --> 00:57:39,533
I think you're supposed
to stand off to the side here.

1225
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:39,950
It doesn't matter.

1226
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,183
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I

1227
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:51,316
you're right.

1228
00:57:51,316 --> 00:58:00,133
Show oh.

1229
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,566
Oh, my God.

1230
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,950
She caught me.

1231
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,500
I didn't see him.

1232
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:11,600
Oh, motherfucker.

1233
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:15,466
I told you to write my right.

1234
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,766
You mean my right
or your right? No, right.

1235
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,450
Like God.

1236
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,700
Way. Yeah.

1237
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,183
This is the way out here.
This is the puzzle.

1238
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:30,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's the way. Out is the way out.

1239
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,750
You want it out, you want to end.

1240
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,650
You want to go back in.

1241
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,150
But we have we have six letters, right?

1242
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,066
Oh, really?

1243
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,616
Oh, yeah. We need the middle three, right?

1244
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,266
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's true.

1245
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:43,250
Oh, my God.
Where are the middle? Three letters.

1246
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,033
Do that. Squeezebox?

1247
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:45,433
Oh, yeah.

1248
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:46,900
Where is he? Heard him.

1249
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,433
I think I heard him yelling.

1250
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,716
Oh, my God.

1251
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:51,550
Yeah.

1252
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,000
I'll go back and get on

1253
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:57,616
I miss.

1254
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:58,816
I miss him.

1255
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,583
I'll go back for the boy.

1256
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,583
The demon needs

1257
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,616
the help of the demon slayer.

1258
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,650
Imagine that.

1259
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:16,583
Vox Vox

1260
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Vox, are you there?

1261
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:28,816
VOX Well, if he's already back

1262
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,650
on, if he's already back, like,
he just slipped by.

1263
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,866
There's no way did he go check

1264
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,633
he could already

1265
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:43,033
be back, and I just, like,
you know, look like an idiot, so.

1266
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:45,566
But it's the thought that counts, right?

1267
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:47,050
The thought that counts

1268
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:55,900
all hello.

1269
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,433
Hello.

1270
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:01,366
I'll wait.

1271
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:03,466
Why is it so long?

1272
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:06,283
Oh, my God, you.

1273
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:07,483
The cornfields.

1274
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:08,633
Ah, these aren't even cornfields.

1275
01:00:08,633 --> 01:00:10,433
These are just trees.

1276
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:13,733
I feel so lost right now.

1277
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:15,533
This is insane.

1278
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,133
Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is.

1279
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:21,500
Yeah. All along, the three. Hi.

1280
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,900
All I want.

1281
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,483
I want back to.

1282
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:26,116
Look for Vox, and he was already back
here, OK?

1283
01:00:26,116 --> 01:00:27,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He that he died.

1284
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,300
Or you were looking for. Me.

1285
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,333
Yeah, I thought your back of the cavern
by your cell phone.

1286
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,433
I was. I was thinking some quick facts.

1287
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:34,333
But that's a company.

1288
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,783
Equifax.

1289
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,083
Tim English.

1290
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:44,833
You you equate how do you say Equinox?

1291
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,733
You're like in English.

1292
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:48,616
Where. What is it?

1293
01:00:48,616 --> 01:00:50,716
And what even is like Equinox.

1294
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:51,983
Know it. When?

1295
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:54,250
When the sun. Equinoxes.

1296
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,866
Yeah. Yeah, it might be that.

1297
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:59,050
Let me try.
That. I've never even heard of that. Word.

1298
01:00:59,083 --> 01:00:59,983
Oh, wait.

1299
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:03,550
I heard it in Avatar on it series.

1300
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,233
Yeah, it's like you ever heard of the
spring equinox and the summer solstice?

1301
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,583
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1302
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,550
If everything is going to die
because of the fire station.

1303
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,700
OK, ok, ok. I've heard it in Swedish.

1304
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,900
Non English.

1305
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,600
Everything changes.

1306
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,716
It, isn't he?

1307
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:25,900
Q I mean, the duties of fire.

1308
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,950
So that kind of makes sense.

1309
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,833
You know, by nature, the dude has like
five tattoos in his body.

1310
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:31,733
Kind of makes sense. Yeah.

1311
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:33,500
Yeah.

1312
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:36,166
Quit Knox's and.

1313
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,950
Oh, yeah, that would that would
kind of make sense, wouldn't it?

1314
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:41,416
And so I'm so is my.

1315
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:46,600
Your would you go oh.

1316
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:49,483
Let's go find a ship.

1317
01:01:49,483 --> 01:01:51,466
Fuel gas.

1318
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:51,850
Also.

1319
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,300
Apparently the books are collectable,

1320
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,900
so we should pick up the books
or something like 00.

1321
01:01:58,283 --> 01:02:00,950
What are the loading screen jumps Skip.

1322
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,116
Yeah, that's. True to me.

1323
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:04,600
What we have a. And go.

1324
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,233
Lancer now.

1325
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:08,566
Oh yeah. We got a lot of pain.

1326
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,183
Oh this is so much better.

1327
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:11,600
I mean my radio is not working either.

1328
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,033
It can move further into the maze
if I can get a signal.

1329
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:16,816
Drove him to system.

1330
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,300
Joanne, Joanne.

1331
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,116
Joanne from June one wrong.

1332
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:23,900
Fear.

1333
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:27,850
My one.

1334
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:32,700
I like it, but I can make you
guys laugh with one of yours.

1335
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,150
Imagine imagine unironically being called
Juan and just.

1336
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,600
Just being that horse.

1337
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,983
One point

1338
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,600
was this a potato or no slot potato?

1339
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,150
I love how it is.

1340
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,300
Like, slowly getting to know Spanish means
I love it here.

1341
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,483
Well.

1342
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,733
It's something you don't get lost.

1343
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:57,700
All right, all right. I'm coming.

1344
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,233
Up. Let's get us. Lost.

1345
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,450
Why are the paths so much wider now?

1346
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,500
This is not a scary.

1347
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,033
It might narrow out.

1348
01:03:05,033 --> 01:03:08,200
It may be the new monster
was like a different mechanic.

1349
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,266
Yeah, maybe he maybe he's a thick boy.

1350
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:12,833
We'll have those six.

1351
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:13,900
Oh, yeah, we did.

1352
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,450
A thick boy.

1353
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,500
Oh, I said, no.

1354
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,716
I go. I think there's.

1355
01:03:20,716 --> 01:03:22,750
Something behind the gates.
I can hear it breathing.

1356
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,933
One. One.

1357
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:26,900
One, one. Oh.

1358
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,583
Fuck you.

1359
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,316
Oh, my God.

1360
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:32,400
That's my fucking guy. But

1361
01:03:33,716 --> 01:03:34,216
you laugh.

1362
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:37,000
You really should stop here.

1363
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,433
Now, you do realise you're asking a bunch.

1364
01:03:39,433 --> 01:03:41,583
Of people
that are traumatised by that nice.

1365
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,033
Guy huh?

1366
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,033
It's definitely of all the fun and games.

1367
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,900
Definitely out of the gate.

1368
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,683
It's definitely the funniest jump scare
noise.

1369
01:03:53,683 --> 01:03:56,033
Like, it just sounds like someone
getting flattened by a car.

1370
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,933
My guy.

1371
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:01,183
Who is the animatronic,
that gave me the most trouble.

1372
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:03,916
I'm betting it's either like it's
oh, it's always balloon boy.

1373
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:06,100
It's always. Balloon boy. Balloon shit.

1374
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:06,733
And what else?

1375
01:04:06,733 --> 01:04:07,400
Balloon boy?

1376
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,550
Oh, yeah, that's a be quiet.

1377
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:11,716
Shut the fuck up.

1378
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:14,266
That new guy I think it's a new guy.

1379
01:04:14,866 --> 01:04:15,533
I'm different.

1380
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah.

1381
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:21,550
What was that?

1382
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,750
You dropped it still.

1383
01:04:24,466 --> 01:04:25,850
What's he doing?

1384
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,400
Why is he dropping the dump?

1385
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,033
We got to stop him.
This is a public place.

1386
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,100
He can't do. That. I don't think.

1387
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:32,983
I think I thought he was pooping.

1388
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:36,016
And me, not one. Ain't anything. Pooping.

1389
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:38,800
Oh, it's so dark down here.

1390
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,166
It's behind the gates.

1391
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,833
I guess we're face faced. Safe for now.

1392
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,900
Yeah,
I think. I think he's behind the gates.

1393
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,333
If anyone else finds themselves
locked in here.

1394
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,666
I'm sorry. I'm closing the gate behind me.

1395
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,316
That thing has been travelling me
through the maze

1396
01:04:51,316 --> 01:04:55,733
ever since I pull the lever, I can hear it
thumping steps and it's raspy breath.

1397
01:04:56,116 --> 01:04:57,616
I need to get away from it.

1398
01:04:57,616 --> 01:04:59,566
I'm not sure I can keep going.

1399
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,850
That's following me.

1400
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,850
One. Guys, the other tape, I got to say

1401
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,533
unlocked. Unlock the main gate.

1402
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:06,200
Get him in the maze.

1403
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,050
Farm field, take greenhouse
cages, take playground.

1404
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,616
Oh, managed to get.

1405
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:14,033
Through the first gate.

1406
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:16,733
So to go to the greenhouse and around
playground, whatever but this second.

1407
01:05:16,733 --> 01:05:17,233
Gate now.

1408
01:05:18,316 --> 01:05:20,416
There's
open space that I can see behind it.

1409
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,516
Which I'm willing to take.
Doesn't really say much.

1410
01:05:22,516 --> 01:05:26,383
He's just like, I solved a puzzle and
I got him, but I can't get any further.

1411
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,050
OK, now, Felicity.

1412
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,533
How can I get the damn thing open.

1413
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,900
I hear the tape is over, but the tape
didn't really didn't share anything.

1414
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,000
Like, he was just like, Oh, Dwight.

1415
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,550
He sounds constipated.

1416
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,383
The tape is overrated.

1417
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,716
You hear that?

1418
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,183
There comes

1419
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:50,633
notes like a mummy.

1420
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:53,350
Sounds like.

1421
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,700
It. Sounds like it's right in front of us.

1422
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,883
Yeah, he's probably walking
through the corridor, past the trees,

1423
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,083
one on the right

1424
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,633
come on.

1425
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:06,733
Reason why they gave us lanterns
instead of flashlights.

1426
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,533
They're so much worse.

1427
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:09,950
I don't know.

1428
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,533
If you like the way more. It's just maybe.

1429
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:14,533
It looks like lanterns.

1430
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,200
I see.

1431
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,566
I see the person
more like the actual person better.

1432
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,483
I see. I see more with the lantern.

1433
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:23,150
I feel like we connect better
when I use a lantern.

1434
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,833
Oh. Collectable.

1435
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,600
Collectable.

1436
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,566
All right.

1437
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,600
It's highly collectable.

1438
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:34,483
All right, Glowsticks.

1439
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:35,183
Thank you.

1440
01:06:35,183 --> 01:06:37,400
You guys have a watch guys

1441
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,183
I, i it's breathing down my throat.

1442
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:42,916
I mean, my, my, my neck.

1443
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,050
Why? My throat?

1444
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:45,583
My neck.

1445
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,200
I meant. Yeah.

1446
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,366
Was breathing. What it's like.

1447
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:50,983
Who is fucking Carl Weasley?

1448
01:06:50,983 --> 01:06:53,116
Is he wheezing down your throat?

1449
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:54,950
I Jimmy's mom.

1450
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,083
What's wrong? Shout. That shouldn't be.

1451
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,400
You're craving my cat.

1452
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,450
So she do want a cross honouring.

1453
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:01,783

Is a monster.

1456
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:07,816
Wait, I just have one more and then.

1457
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,316
That'll be it.

1458
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,350
Every remove reminder

1459
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,200

1460
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200

01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:16,333
I'm searching for?

1462
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:19,150
Think she went to the forest?

1463
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:23,883
I wasn't.

1464
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,016

OK, here. Hold on My goal.

1475
01:07:58,216 --> 01:07:59,533

1476
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,783
The game loves winning
I thought What the fuck is that?

1477
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:04,066

1478
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:07,516

01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:10,133
I think he turned out

1480
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,350
Professor,

1481
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:17,333
my lab partner is nowhere to be found.

1482
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:20,300
We found exposed stick.

1483
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,166
Oh, blue.

1484
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:23,333
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1485
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,450
Wait, I did go down this way.

1486
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,583
Left a trail.

1487
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Evil

1488
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,383
what was that?

1489
01:08:35,383 --> 01:08:36,883
Look behind you.

1490
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,250
We we got lots of all VOCs.

1491
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,516
Is that what happens?
I think he got locked.

1492
01:08:43,516 --> 01:08:45,316
She all know.

1493
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:48,616
I think in late, I heard a guy.

1494
01:08:48,616 --> 01:08:50,800
All in all, we're stuck.

1495
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,500
Do just take the stay off me yourself. Me?

1496
01:08:53,516 --> 01:08:56,900
I don't want to get locked away
behind some roots over here.

1497
01:08:57,283 --> 01:08:58,483
I think

1498
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,850
I do those creepy.

1499
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:06,850
You are super creepy.

1500
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,483
And remind me of Harry Potter.

1501
01:09:08,483 --> 01:09:10,583
You remind me of everything.

1502
01:09:11,183 --> 01:09:12,250
What's it called?

1503
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,700
One. I'm in

1504
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:17,500
the one of a part of EB.

1505
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,183
When Gary and

1506
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,983
Gibbon Mary got separated.

1507
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,200
The trail stops here.

1508
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,933
Which will stay here.

1509
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:29,183
I don't think it would have said a
player has died.

1510
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:32,300
I found the house.

1511
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,433
Hello?

1512
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:35,716
Someone locked in here.

1513
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:37,633
Oh, is that Ike?

1514
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:40,366
Hello.

1515
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:43,850
Oh, no.

1516
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,050
Guilties

1517
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,350
hello.

1518
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,416
Ah, I think I'm.

1519
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,900
I'm the all.

1520
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,766
All. That's not good.

1521
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,683
I just put my glowsticks
to let people know I was here.

1522
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,616
Is pretty bad.

1523
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,583
Blow.

1524
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:15,766
Why not find my glowsticks

1525
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:24,316
i think he might have died.

1526
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:27,683
I think the monster got remote. OK,

1527
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,233
I'm the only one here at the moment.

1528
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:32,350
The mixture evaporates.

1529
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,733
What mixture?

1530
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,050
Odds and vines reacts.

1531
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,300
The common pesticides just to make my own.

1532
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:41,183
Is this.

1533
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:45,350
Chloride?

1534
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:01,483
Low, low?

1535
01:11:02,233 --> 01:11:03,983
The fuck was that.

1536
01:11:04,283 --> 01:11:06,250
Chloride reacting of yellow and green dye?

1537
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,983
Need to swap it with another bottle.

1538
01:11:08,983 --> 01:11:10,850
Need some move.

1539
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:12,766
What is that?

1540
01:11:12,766 --> 01:11:16,300
C-H seven from red to yellow

1541
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,250
sulphate.

1542
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:23,200
I sell sulphur oxygen in green chickens
nationally.

1543
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:28,100
So far the valve on red leaking
do not use a cell or stage seven

1544
01:11:29,716 --> 01:11:31,750
blue dye holding up
well should be ok to leave

1545
01:11:32,383 --> 01:11:34,933
C chloride in their

1546
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:37,183
CB breaking down an all balls except red

1547
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:39,283
guys.

1548
01:11:39,283 --> 01:11:40,550
Give me an update.

1549
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:41,083
Give me an update.

1550
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,883
What's happening
with the others right now.

1551
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:46,183
And all is VOCs is VOCs I can remove good.

1552
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,066
I do chemistry

1553
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:53,933
box died.

1554
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,100
Ah wow.

1555
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,600
That's bad.

1556
01:11:58,066 --> 01:12:00,650
While the game split us up

1557
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:05,266
it's mixture evaporates what's.

1558
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,583
What goes off blue.

1559
01:12:12,766 --> 01:12:14,566
What I start with

1560
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,933
yellow and green

1561
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:19,216
yellow

1562
01:12:19,216 --> 01:12:22,366
and green my objective updated
what did I do?

1563
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,300
I do something.

1564
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,750
I don't know if I did anything or not.

1565
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,700
It's a swap off another bottle

1566
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,016
mm hmm.

1567
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:33,800
All right.

1568
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,183
I'm really confused.

1569
01:12:35,183 --> 01:12:38,933
I need their help right now
because I know if I need more bottles

1570
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:42,100
or a light I'm just going to head back.

1571
01:12:43,133 --> 01:12:45,950
Like, please hope I can find them.

1572
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:54,700
They found each other.

1573
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,900
OK, good, good, good, good, good.

1574
01:12:59,983 --> 01:13:03,083
Oh, now

1575
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:05,050
I feel so lost.

1576
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:06,050
It's here.

1577
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,450
I feel so goddamn lost.

1578
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,900
In this maze

1579
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,600
oh, no.

1580
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,083
Should I just die

1581
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,666
so I can regroup with them?

1582
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,450
Where is it

1583
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:47,050
where is the creature oh.

1584
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:55,300
Hello.

1585
01:13:55,816 --> 01:13:57,250
Hello.

1586
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:01,483
What is this clue?

1587
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:03,533
Oh, yeah, they've been here before.

1588
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:07,100
It's like there's like Glowsticks
gone into this direction.

1589
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:11,383
But well.

1590
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:13,450
This is a dead end.

1591
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:18,800
OK, I'm going to.

1592
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,766
Yeah, I'll quickly die so I can regroup
with them since I don't know.

1593
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:27,916
Right now, being separate feels

1594
01:14:28,933 --> 01:14:30,533
not so good.

1595
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,166
It's probably not the best idea right now.

1596
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:39,666
Uh, where is the.

1597
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,750
Hollow. Creature?

1598
01:14:41,866 --> 01:14:43,300
Do you hear me?

1599
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:44,566
Hello?

1600
01:14:45,883 --> 01:14:46,666
Hello?

1601
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,950
I'm a human close by, but.

1602
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,433
I don't or

1603
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:02,683
what the.

1604
01:15:02,683 --> 01:15:04,733
Fuck was that?

1605
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,800
Oh, my God, guys, I lost you.

1606
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,366
I got you

1607
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:14,000
you got me.

1608
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:16,883
I found you.

1609
01:15:16,883 --> 01:15:18,400
Where is everybody?

1610
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,683
I lost them like I was by myself for
the longest time, so I had to come back.

1611
01:15:22,683 --> 01:15:25,283
Yeah, find somebody to me to all the shit
I saw.

1612
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:27,683
You get clobbered. By him
from the distance.

1613
01:15:27,683 --> 01:15:29,866
That was crazy. What is that?

1614
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:30,916
Does he have a clone?

1615
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:33,250
No. He's
some kind of a terrifying tree spirit.

1616
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,166
All right,
I guess it's just you and me now.

1617
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,800
Yeah, they're really far in. They're.

1618
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,583
I'm apparently, I think one of them
or a couple of them died.

1619
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,550
Unless I was you that died multiple times.

1620
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:45,950
I I've re spawned manually.

1621
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:48,166
One think he would help me
find people, but.

1622
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:52,783
OK, so I think that means that I think
I died.

1623
01:15:52,783 --> 01:15:54,400
And Ramu also died.

1624
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,750
Oh, now, I don't know, brah.

1625
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:57,800
I saw a couple deaths.

1626
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,233
Yeah. Did you ever die?

1627
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,933
No. I avoided him there all.

1628
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,450
Way if we can just go back.

1629
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,533
We should just go grab him.

1630
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:07,216
Yeah, I grab everybody.

1631
01:16:07,216 --> 01:16:08,650
What happened. Though.

1632
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,200
Was, like,

1633
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,633
me and Raymie were going through the maze,
and there was like, a vines

1634
01:16:13,633 --> 01:16:17,850
that grew up behind us and separated us
from everybody else, and then.

1635
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,300
Oh, OK.

1636
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,616
I'm OK. They both died.
They both type. OK.

1637
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,133
So the game like, wants to separate us.

1638
01:16:24,316 --> 01:16:28,100
I think it should be a round about here.

1639
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,433
Or there back at the. Ah.

1640
01:16:30,433 --> 01:16:32,200
Hello.

1641
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:33,550
Hello?

1642
01:16:34,233 --> 01:16:35,250
Hello.

1643
01:16:35,783 --> 01:16:38,233
Hello? Hello.

1644
01:16:38,233 --> 01:16:40,033
You guys hear

1645
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,650
Raimo Ik?

1646
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:43,850
Do they have a new save point?

1647
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,666
Did they find it like a different area?

1648
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,983
There's no way.

1649
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,950
Hello.

1650
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:52,966
Hello.

1651
01:16:52,966 --> 01:16:54,650
Tre, go.

1652
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,600
I'll. No, I'm here.

1653
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,583
Ominous sound effects.
I feel like this is the wrong way.

1654
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:00,500
Yeah, stuff.

1655
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,916
Definitely the horn with the fuck out.

1656
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,000
Wait, that's them.

1657
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,633
Oh, my God.

1658
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,666
Friends we thought we found one steal,
and then I found another puzzle room.

1659
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:11,750
Yeah.

1660
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:15,033
I found the chemistry area. Hmm.

1661
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:16,400
They said Nick is a. Naked.

1662
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,166
Lady runs towards you.
Yeah. And I got beaten up.

1663
01:17:19,183 --> 01:17:21,100
I got beaten up by a naked man.

1664
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,366
Yeah, I watched it happen.

1665
01:17:22,366 --> 01:17:23,333
It was pretty terrifying.

1666
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:24,016
He's huge.

1667
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:27,583
I think. I think. I think there would be.

1668
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:29,750
If this is not a face,
you can stand still.

1669
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:31,516
I'm sorry.

1670
01:17:31,883 --> 01:17:33,950
You guys hear that?
There she is. Oh, she's coming right out.

1671
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,766
Oh, let's get out of here.

1672
01:17:39,466 --> 01:17:40,700
OK, so.

1673
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,533
I'm not ready to die again.

1674
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:45,133
And it works with the flashlight.

1675
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,383
I say point the flashlight at her. Oh.

1676
01:17:49,483 --> 01:17:53,183
God, you bitch. Oh.

1677
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,800
You shall. Not really.

1678
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,166
It doesn't work that well.

1679
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:58,100
Oh, it kind of does.

1680
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,750
Oh, it does. One.

1681
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,200
Oh. Oh, oh. Old rock through.

1682
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:02,983
Running box box.

1683
01:18:02,983 --> 01:18:04,866
Back up, back up, back up.

1684
01:18:12,133 --> 01:18:14,866
She's giving everyone.

1685
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:16,033
She got a triple kill.

1686
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:16,883
What's

1687
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,850
what is that?

1688
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,450
I mean, the flashlight kind of works.

1689
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,850
Please. I guess you can all go near her.

1690
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:27,783
Oh, your theory of, like,
blinded motherfucker.

1691
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:29,183
Would you go back? She was.

1692
01:18:29,183 --> 01:18:31,100
She was. Spooked by the light for a. Bit.

1693
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Yeah,
she was, like, trying to cover her eyes.

1694
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:33,883
Yeah.

1695
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:35,483
Was it flashing it on and off?

1696
01:18:35,483 --> 01:18:37,883
That helps her. I don't know.

1697
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:40,516
I think I just. Pointed out
you just got a point. Out.

1698
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:41,450
OK, that's to you.

1699
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,150
I think. I think it stops there for a bit.

1700
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,416
Yeah, OK.

1701
01:18:45,983 --> 01:18:46,633
She's there.

1702
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,683
There's another dude. There's another guy.
He just.

1703
01:18:49,216 --> 01:18:50,950
There's two.
There's two. They're coming together.

1704
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:51,633
Yeah. No, no.

1705
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:52,933
Switch over to the lantern.

1706
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:54,016
Switch over to the lantern.

1707
01:18:54,016 --> 01:18:55,100
That works

1708
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,166
she's so fucking slow.

1709
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,000
Look at her.

1710
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,366
OK, maybe it doesn't work.

1711
01:19:04,933 --> 01:19:08,533
OK, I'm going to go into the

1712
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:15,633
ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1713
01:19:15,633 --> 01:19:17,200
Hey, hey.

1714
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:21,916
I thought it worked.

1715
01:19:21,916 --> 01:19:22,933
It did not.

1716
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,666
Guy got my balls.

1717
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:27,166
She dropped them off.

1718
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,666
I got you.
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1719
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:32,266
I got you, I got you. Oh,

1720
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,233
then I got. You.

1721
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:36,200
Oh, no,

1722
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,883
I grabbed your dang it.

1723
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:55,400
Cock and ball.

1724
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,550
Ow, ow, ow.

1725
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,533
All of us died.

1726
01:19:59,533 --> 01:19:59,800
Yeah, we.

1727
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,200
Got quadra killed.

1728
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:06,533
All right, everybody, welcome back.

1729
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:09,283
We're back in the cabin. Oh, man.

1730
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:11,950
That is.

1731
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,333
That is one tough cookie.

1732
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:13,900
I feel like.

1733
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,616
Like they're blinding.

1734
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,950
Thing only works sometimes.

1735
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,016
Yeah. And then when it works,
it gives us enough time.

1736
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:20,683
So, you know.

1737
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:22,783
The access game and all that.

1738
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,100
Oh. We remove all there.

1739
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:30,650
There we go. We just slide.

1740
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,933
Low flying along.

1741
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:35,950
Oh, you just kind of folded
it folded up like a deck.

1742
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:36,800
Do we got?

1743
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,966
What we need to do is
you use the flashlight, not the lantern.

1744
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,550
The flashlight, and
then you blind blender, and then you run.

1745
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,483
I think that's the only thing.

1746
01:20:44,483 --> 01:20:48,050
Yeah, we got a blender
and then one she, like, cowers for a bit.

1747
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,333
Yeah, we can.

1748
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,383
We have time to run away and make distance

1749
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:53,883
because we can't just, like,
chill inside the tree.

1750
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,266
Know, I was pretty far away from Ike,
but she still got me, so I think we just

1751
01:20:58,283 --> 01:20:59,233
need to blend in, then run.

1752
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:03,533
OK, but
we got to make it back to the puzzle.

1753
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:06,350
Me and. The puzzle. Yeah. I also find.

1754
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,583
My puzzle two left glow sticks things
I have.

1755
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:12,283
Puzzle one. You.

1756
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:15,016
Oh, I just have a sense for like.

1757
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:17,950
She said, I said he lied.

1758
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:18,850
I see

1759
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,716
there they are.

1760
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:28,900
Here they come

1761
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,000
and Run.

1762
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,683
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1763
01:21:32,683 --> 01:21:34,433
I'm with her in this corner.

1764
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,433
She left to turn left.

1765
01:21:42,316 --> 01:21:43,850
Yeah, but then she left.

1766
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,400
Kind of an. Upper left.

1767
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,633
You look at my. Look at my bike.

1768
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:48,916
Hey, he's turning left.

1769
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,550
Oh. When I go the I go left.

1770
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:54,233
I don't know where I went.
I went somewhere else.

1771
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,066
Oh, no.

1772
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:55,850
Either.

1773
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,300
Oh, my God. She's chasing ice.

1774
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,350
Guys, I've had a puzzle.

1775
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:01,333
Oh, no.

1776
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,283
You found a puzzle.

1777
01:22:04,283 --> 01:22:05,050
Where

1778
01:22:05,866 --> 01:22:06,816
puzzle

1779
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:13,000
I just like trying to blame her
and then actively running away from.

1780
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,733
Yeah, he's hiding her really well.

1781
01:22:15,733 --> 01:22:18,350
OK, guys, got to tape. Tape to tape.

1782
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,383
Oh, there is a tape here.

1783
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,650
For I think he's doing.

1784
01:22:24,016 --> 01:22:25,733
Is he still running?

1785
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:26,866
You can burn.

1786
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:29,233
All are you to the.

1787
01:22:29,233 --> 01:22:30,083
Spiders.

1788
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:33,200
You've been attacked by a virtual world,

1789
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,416
literally on your own.

1790
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:39,433
You have handled it like OK.

1791
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,850
OK, maybe this isn't a puzzle.

1792
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:44,500
Maybe it's just me.

1793
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,550
I think because.

1794
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:47,633
It was kind of
more like a collectable area.

1795
01:22:47,683 --> 01:22:50,966
Rather than a puzzle.

1796
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,383
Got a tape galore.

1797
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:55,183
That's what we're here for, right?

1798
01:22:55,933 --> 01:22:56,566
Oh, no.

1799
01:22:56,566 --> 01:22:58,883
Vox. Vox Fox.

1800
01:23:00,683 --> 01:23:02,633
Hello? Fox.

1801
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,650
Fox. I think we got separated.

1802
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:08,050
Oh, no. Vox Oh, shit.

1803
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,383
Dude, that's bad. Fuck.

1804
01:23:10,383 --> 01:23:11,950
Vox I think we got separated.

1805
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,050
Oh, no.

1806
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,850
I can't get to you.

1807
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,983
I can't get to you. I'm separated.

1808
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,800
The vines are in the way.

1809
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,900
Oh, no,

1810
01:23:24,016 --> 01:23:25,216
how do I get you there?

1811
01:23:25,216 --> 01:23:27,350
I don't. I don't think I can.

1812
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,266
You'll have the chemical

1813
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,783
oh, this is so sad.

1814
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:41,266
I can we get ten gifted sobs all there.

1815
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:44,450
What do I do?

1816
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:45,016
What do I do?

1817
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:48,416
What I do, I go

1818
01:23:52,216 --> 01:23:53,500
What is that?

1819
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,783
Who is that guy?

1820
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:00,833
I think.

1821
01:24:01,966 --> 01:24:04,250
I think it's Gigi for me.

1822
01:24:09,983 --> 01:24:11,416
Well,

1823
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:13,483
well,

1824
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:15,133
I'm back

1825
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:22,400
I got crushed by that giant,
towering beast.

1826
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:25,183
There's two monsters
inside this labyrinth.

1827
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,516
I didn't think that was going to be like,
two of them.

1828
01:24:28,516 --> 01:24:30,500
I thought it was just going to be one

1829
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,950
new one, but now there's two
we have to watch out for.

1830
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,100
That's really creepy.

1831
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:40,400
I got separated again and know.

1832
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:43,033
And then I was all alone.

1833
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,333
You can have nice things.

1834
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,750
Yeah, we can have nice things.

1835
01:24:52,516 --> 01:24:53,083
Oh, I hear.

1836
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:53,800
I hear people.

1837
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,550
Hello, friends.

1838
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,466
Yeah, we're. In the puzzle room.

1839
01:24:57,683 --> 01:25:01,000
Probably like

1840
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:04,666
hooking up with the lady.

1841
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,983
You the the
the monsters right in front of me.

1842
01:25:07,216 --> 01:25:10,000
The monsters right in front of me. OK.

1843
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,783
Guys, guys,
what do I do? He's he's. Right.

1844
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:14,650
It's just coming from, like.

1845
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,150
All they're dying.

1846
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,800
All my friends are getting massacred
right in front of me.

1847
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,250
I can't do anything about it.

1848
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:29,750
Hold on.

1849
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:34,183
Let me see mhm.

1850
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,100
I'm. I'm quite.

1851
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:45,166
I'm kind of confused about how the vet can
make it over there in time to to revive.

1852
01:25:45,383 --> 01:25:48,800
Maybe. Maybe. Hello? Hello? No.

1853
01:25:50,183 --> 01:25:51,983
Make it in time.

1854
01:25:54,433 --> 01:25:56,483
Run! Why are you running?

1855
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:58,400
Why are you running?

1856
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,883
Because I'm running to save my friends.

1857
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:04,150
Objective. Updated. Wait.

1858
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,800
They. They solved something.

1859
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,416
Oh, that's pretty good.

1860
01:26:11,183 --> 01:26:13,633
I got to make it over to them.

1861
01:26:16,216 --> 01:26:18,250
Like, I'm, like, so lost right now.

1862
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,316
I'm so lost. Player just died.

1863
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:22,450
Wow. Bloggers.

1864
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,500
Actually, that's not bloggers.

1865
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:31,216
Maybe I can go back and retrieve
them. Hmm.

1866
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,433
We'd like respond.

1867
01:26:34,433 --> 01:26:36,433
Hi. Hi. Hi.

1868
01:26:36,433 --> 01:26:38,633
They expect you to do this stuff,
which were my dad's.

1869
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,466
Are you serious?

1870
01:26:39,466 --> 01:26:42,133
Yeah, dude,
that's why I'm. That's why they told me.

1871
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:44,900
To turn off. Permits after dad's. No way.

1872
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,200
We would have. We would have, like, guns.

1873
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,216
OK, I saw. I saw the tree guy.

1874
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,800
I think both of them work the same way.

1875
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,083
They see you
from a really far away distance,

1876
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:55,450
but I don't think the flashlight works
in the trade.

1877
01:26:55,483 --> 01:26:57,100
Few moments. Later.

1878
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,516
Yeah, there's basically two of them.

1879
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,433
Also, they have, like, a certain rule,

1880
01:27:01,433 --> 01:27:03,950
and they go all the way
back to the puzzle room.

1881
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:08,416
Yeah, I figured out what to do for, like,
the puzzle that me and him have found.

1882
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:11,116
It's just going to take me a while.

1883
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:16,266
And I don't remember where to find
the chemistry puzzle that I had earlier.

1884
01:27:16,266 --> 01:27:17,050
It's. That's.

1885
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,383
That's like throwing me off.

1886
01:27:18,383 --> 01:27:20,083
The whenever Vox went.

1887
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,633
Ah. Vox So, I mean, there.

1888
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:23,333
Oh, boy.

1889
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,550
Yeah, he's somewhere in there.

1890
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,700
Did he figure it out? I'm sorry.

1891
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,633
Did you guys have what's it called?

1892
01:27:29,633 --> 01:27:31,600
A decided objective? Got updated.

1893
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,583
Someone solves a puzzle or.

1894
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:35,483
Yeah. I didn't solve.

1895
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:35,933
Oh, yeah.

1896
01:27:35,933 --> 01:27:37,250
There she is.

1897
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,783
My highlights.

1898
01:27:41,783 --> 01:27:44,350
No, she says she's coming

1899
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:46,700
off you.

1900
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,250
Run, run. Run, run, run.

1901
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,600
Oh, no.

1902
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,150
I got separated.

1903
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:05,833
You got to be kidding. Me.

1904
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,100
You got to be kidding me.

1905
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,366
No, no, you got to be kidding me.

1906
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,383
You locked me away.

1907
01:28:12,383 --> 01:28:15,166
Fuck off the tree, guy.

1908
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,533
To me.

1909
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:17,933
Where is this.

1910
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,283
Oh. Oh, God.

1911
01:28:27,283 --> 01:28:28,433
I'm alone.

1912
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:29,800
I need help.

1913
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,750
What are your children?

1914
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:35,450
Oh, this is so.

1915
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,483
Oh, my God. This is bad.

1916
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:39,100
This is really. Bad.

1917
01:28:40,116 --> 01:28:54,183
Oh, oh.

1918
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,100
Oh, hey, there.

1919
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:55,633
Hey, buddy.

1920
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,350
Hey. Hi.

1921
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:10,783
Oh. Well, I found a different area.

1922
01:29:10,783 --> 01:29:12,133
That's a that's. That was weird.

1923
01:29:12,133 --> 01:29:14,600
That was like a playground
or some type of shit

1924
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,216
is cool, though, but

1925
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:22,283
who else died?

1926
01:29:22,283 --> 01:29:22,600
I know.

1927
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,083
I said somebody else died, but

1928
01:29:27,983 --> 01:29:28,966
I heard children laughing.

1929
01:29:28,966 --> 01:29:29,983
All the lights went out.

1930
01:29:29,983 --> 01:29:33,466
It bursted in front of me.

1931
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:34,483
That was not fun.

1932
01:29:38,183 --> 01:29:40,283
And then locks me away again. Why?

1933
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,400
This game is fucked up.

1934
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,050
It likes isolating me

1935
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,600
it really enjoys isolating me.

1936
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,250
I think I heard them somewhere.

1937
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,333
That's either

1938
01:29:57,166 --> 01:29:59,916
got their own lights, sex, drive, all that

1939
01:30:06,483 --> 01:30:09,866
the monsters want me to themselves.

1940
01:30:12,133 --> 01:30:14,066
Like it's more like

1941
01:30:15,733 --> 01:30:18,133
they want to are my friends.

1942
01:30:18,233 --> 01:30:20,650
Oh, I know. I just want back in circles.

1943
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,650
What. Bro?

1944
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,200
I just want back in circles.

1945
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,650
Holy shit.

1946
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,100
I didn't even realise
I went back into a whole circle.

1947
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,600
Oh, my God, man.

1948
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:35,250
OK, knuckle.

1949
01:30:35,683 --> 01:30:38,400
I though the tree dude looks kind of nice
like his. Ah,

1950
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:41,450
like a style

1951
01:30:41,933 --> 01:30:43,700
I ah. I miss Voxer.

1952
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,250
It's been a while since we saw Vox.

1953
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,866
The hell he go

1954
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,533
I can smell him

1955
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,733
because like,
it seems like he would go down this way

1956
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,250
oh, maybe

1957
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:05,650
actually.

1958
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:08,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1959
01:31:09,233 --> 01:31:11,283
There's a Gary here.

1960
01:31:11,283 --> 01:31:13,700
Very been down here till I see red

1961
01:31:16,483 --> 01:31:18,650
is follow the red.

1962
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:23,116
All all

1963
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:26,933
hello.

1964
01:31:26,933 --> 01:31:28,783
I'm lost.

1965
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,300
I'm. I'm just some lost boy.

1966
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:32,600
I don't.

1967
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,450
I'm, I, I got a family.

1968
01:31:35,933 --> 01:31:37,150
I, uh.

1969
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:40,516
Hello, friends.

1970
01:31:40,516 --> 01:31:42,133
Hello.

1971
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:44,500
Hello.

1972
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:47,233
Hello.

1973
01:31:47,566 --> 01:31:48,766
Oh, shit.

1974
01:31:48,766 --> 01:31:50,333
That's pretty bad.

1975
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,966
This is pretty bad.

1976
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,400
Oh, wait on me.

1977
01:31:58,633 --> 01:32:02,166
Maybe I can all all Ike's drill

1978
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:04,700
I can re drill.

1979
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,633
OK, ok.

1980
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:07,250
OK, ok.

1981
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:11,116
I think again.

1982
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,633
Megan, closer.

1983
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,100
Am I going closer?

1984
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,900
Am I going further?

1985
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,883
Dude, I honestly can't tell.

1986
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:20,900
I can't tell at all.

1987
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,183
Where are we going?

1988
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:25,150
The fuck am I going?

1989
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:33,883
Am I am I even at it's
or it's the right direction now or. Or

1990
01:32:36,233 --> 01:32:37,633
oh, fuck that.

1991
01:32:37,633 --> 01:32:41,233
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1992
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:45,100
Well.

1993
01:32:45,616 --> 01:32:48,800
Our cock involves

1994
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,233
cock involves oh.

1995
01:32:53,316 --> 01:32:55,400
Oh, I know. Shout out.

1996
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
No. Died at the exact same time.

1997
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:02,350
Yeah, I saw the chance of death and I was
like, OK, I don't, I don't see anybody.

1998
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:06,316
I was alone again. Mm.

1999
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:08,950
Yeah.

2000
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,350
I ran into a similar problem.

2001
01:33:11,483 --> 01:33:13,883
I found two of the disks.
We got two disks now.

2002
01:33:13,966 --> 01:33:16,333
I was out the objectives updated.

2003
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:17,300
Yeah, yeah.

2004
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,866
POG you know, actually, the objective
was updated because we found, like, this.

2005
01:33:20,866 --> 01:33:22,300
Grassy field.

2006
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,750
It with the big the big moss man in it.

2007
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:29,633
Oh, did you guys find the guys
from the playground yet?

2008
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:32,450
Mm. Yeah, I found the playground.

2009
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:35,266
That's where I found that. The disk. Yeah.
I was there too.

2010
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,983
It was it's pretty creepy.

2011
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:38,383
There's kids laughing and everything

2012
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:40,483
like that.

2013
01:33:41,466 --> 01:33:43,900
Think they excited to go back to Resident
Evil.

2014
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,316
Resident Evil seven. Yeah. I saw you.

2015
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:48,916
I've seen the little girl running around,
but she hasn't done anything

2016
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:49,750
and it freaks me out.

2017
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:54,766
So you finished you beat up
what's her Margret beat Marguerite.

2018
01:33:54,766 --> 01:33:57,983
Yeah, I really fucking love
dramatic villain.

2019
01:33:57,983 --> 01:33:59,716
Deaths like that make me very happy.

2020
01:33:59,716 --> 01:34:01,100
Like when you just had it
with the flame thrower,

2021
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,950
and then she just kind of, like,
splutters out and turns did fucking dust.

2022
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:05,233
I was like, yeah.

2023
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:05,650
Yeah.

2024
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:08,050
I was like, Oh, Ike Ramo.

2025
01:34:08,683 --> 01:34:10,333
He got another seal thinks.

2026
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:12,316
He'll need two more SEALs.

2027
01:34:12,316 --> 01:34:14,783
Gamers. Hello.

2028
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:15,916
The other place.

2029
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,333
There's a monster near you, I think.

2030
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,400
Watch out.

2031
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,750
We. Yeah, the the the tree guy.

2032
01:34:20,866 --> 01:34:22,333
Oh, this is a dead end.

2033
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:25,700
I think fox is dead. And here, here.

2034
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:29,116
All children shall watch out, watch out,
watch out.

2035
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,700
Oh, yeah, my glow.

2036
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,566
Oh, hey. Hello.

2037
01:34:33,566 --> 01:34:37,216
I gang's all together again.

2038
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:39,166
OK, where's the altar?

2039
01:34:39,166 --> 01:34:40,150
Where's the altar?

2040
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:42,233
The altar. Like, which altar?

2041
01:34:42,233 --> 01:34:44,500
Where I put the seals.

2042
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,150
It's really, really close to here.

2043
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:49,750
I'm not 100% sure where, but we'll find it

2044
01:34:49,883 --> 01:34:50,150
dude.

2045
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,500
The mount of like, I don't know, euphoria

2046
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,016
I get when we all finally regroup together
God is so.

2047
01:34:57,016 --> 01:35:01,450
Yeah I had such an amazing moment
where I was completely lost in the maze.

2048
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:03,533
And then all of a sudden
I see Damon. I'm like.

2049
01:35:03,533 --> 01:35:05,450
How did you find me? And she just said.

2050
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,450
I found your. Glowsticks.

2051
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,933
You haven't found the glowsticks I'm here.

2052
01:35:08,933 --> 01:35:10,700
But then it's just like we.

2053
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,300
Got we got two discs in here already.

2054
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,166
Oh, yeah. Here. Yes. Ta da!

2055
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,166
OK, ok, now we just need some more.

2056
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:18,883
We can ok.

2057
01:35:18,883 --> 01:35:21,400
We can not get into the greenhouse
because we need a place in.

2058
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:23,000
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't.

2059
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,366
I was trying to figure out the
the what's it called?

2060
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:27,433
The pesticide formula.

2061
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:30,250
It doesn't make any sense. To me.
Do we need to get something else?

2062
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,433
We need to get to that
chemistry room, so, like,

2063
01:35:32,433 --> 01:35:34,133
so we can understand
what she's talking about.

2064
01:35:34,133 --> 01:35:36,466
Yeah, I tried. Yeah,
I didn't understand it. My.

2065
01:35:36,616 --> 01:35:37,950
Hold on. Is it? I know it's.

2066
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,800
Remember how you got there? Shelter.

2067
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,150
I know it's this way.

2068
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,533
I know it's
definitely this way of ghosting,

2069
01:35:44,983 --> 01:35:47,000
but be careful.

2070
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,400
The game might separate us.

2071
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,216
And this is like where?

2072
01:35:49,216 --> 01:35:51,466
I don't know, like,
which. Way to go. The vines.

2073
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:54,200
The vines just, like, pop up sometimes

2074
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:56,566
yeah.

2075
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:59,000
And it forces us to just stay separate.

2076
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,900
So I think we should stick together
really close.

2077
01:36:02,266 --> 01:36:03,766
So it can't, like,

2078
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:06,766
keep us from getting cut off.

2079
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:09,800
Oh. I'm will get.

2080
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,583
I'm over door.

2081
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:11,750
I've been building.

2082
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,900
Yeah.

2083
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,600
Anyway.

2084
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:16,150
OK, what's this?

2085
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:18,883
This looks familiar.
I've been here before. This is close by.

2086
01:36:18,883 --> 01:36:20,966
This really lights of the chemistry.

2087
01:36:20,966 --> 01:36:22,533
Yeah, I think.

2088
01:36:23,016 --> 01:36:26,366
OK, I'll take my glowsticks from here.

2089
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,116
All out.

2090
01:36:36,116 --> 01:36:38,283
There it went. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2091
01:36:38,383 --> 01:36:38,700
We all.

2092
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:39,833
But we're all together.

2093
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:41,883
We're all together. Again this time. Good.

2094
01:36:41,883 --> 01:36:44,783
Oh, things together.

2095
01:36:45,683 --> 01:36:47,783
What does that sound like?

2096
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:50,016
I think it's just us singing.

2097
01:36:50,016 --> 01:36:51,933
No, like the thing with your soul.

2098
01:36:51,933 --> 01:36:56,466
Me What the fuck?

2099
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:59,316
OK, now I don't know where to continue.

2100
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:00,683
But I love you singing.

2101
01:37:00,683 --> 01:37:02,733
Oh, great. Leave it. To me. Hello? To me.

2102
01:37:02,783 --> 01:37:04,350
You might end up with what
I'm on a bit of.

2103
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:06,733
I don't know what you know.
If I follow this, I horse it.

2104
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:09,383
You said I need your plastics
to write my career.

2105
01:37:09,383 --> 01:37:09,783
Thorough.

2106
01:37:11,033 --> 01:37:11,400
Mama.

2107
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,616
Honestly,
that sounded like a fucking incantation.

2108
01:37:13,616 --> 01:37:16,133
I thought as a demon, I would have been.

2109
01:37:16,133 --> 01:37:18,083
What is this shit?

2110
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:20,083
Oh, hello.

2111
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:22,116
Bounce. Hello, gamers.

2112
01:37:22,766 --> 01:37:24,683
Guys, guys.

2113
01:37:24,683 --> 01:37:26,733
Well, say hi to the clown. Oh, hi. There.

2114
01:37:26,983 --> 01:37:30,416
That was one of the freakiest things
I've seen in a game in a long time.

2115
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:31,683
Oh, I hated that.

2116
01:37:31,683 --> 01:37:34,350
They all were getting ingredients
for potions.

2117
01:37:35,033 --> 01:37:36,000
They all like.

2118
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,816
I got the tape.

2119
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:39,366
Fucking froze up on us. It's weird.

2120
01:37:39,366 --> 01:37:41,316
OK, that's good. We found one.

2121
01:37:41,316 --> 01:37:44,483
Now we off on the last one,
which is at the greenhouse, right?

2122
01:37:45,233 --> 01:37:48,533
Human skin on these motherfuckers.

2123
01:37:48,533 --> 01:37:50,016
Oh, my God.

2124
01:37:50,016 --> 01:37:51,266
So creepy.

2125
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:53,366
OK, I can't take these guys seriously.

2126
01:37:53,366 --> 01:37:56,033
They're doing the facial expression of,
you know, the to, like, whoa.

2127
01:37:56,033 --> 01:37:57,866
Jack's, like, pointing behind them.

2128
01:37:57,866 --> 01:37:59,816
Yeah, look.

2129
01:37:59,816 --> 01:38:01,416
Yeah, yeah, I know exactly.

2130
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:02,633
What you're talking about.

2131
01:38:02,633 --> 01:38:05,216
Like, oh, my God, it's this.

2132
01:38:05,216 --> 01:38:06,750
I don't know. I'm not a tea party.

2133
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,983
That's it.

2134
01:38:07,983 --> 01:38:10,050
The tape just cut out.

2135
01:38:10,283 --> 01:38:11,333
I don't know. In the video,

2136
01:38:14,616 --> 01:38:16,233
OK, so I think Melanie's.

2137
01:38:16,233 --> 01:38:18,566
I think that's one ingredient
for the poison. That must be it.

2138
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,950
You found cheese?

2139
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:20,416
What's.

2140
01:38:20,516 --> 01:38:23,583
Yeah, I don't know. Cheese faces.

2141
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:24,983
Really ugly cheese.

2142
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,450
OK, well, I guess that's an ingredient
for the poison.

2143
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,350
How about we go the other way?

2144
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:31,783
We go the other way.
They'll because there's another.

2145
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:32,550
It's off.

2146
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,583
No, it was that cheese. It was.
I think that was it.

2147
01:38:34,583 --> 01:38:36,033
That was a seal.

2148
01:38:36,133 --> 01:38:36,533
Oh, that.

2149
01:38:36,533 --> 01:38:38,216
No, that. Was a seal. You sell.

2150
01:38:38,216 --> 01:38:41,783
Have you thought
that was a wheel of cheese?

2151
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,150
Yeah. It is. Yes.

2152
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:46,350
I heard them.

2153
01:38:46,716 --> 01:38:48,750
Always coming from this side. Right.

2154
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,300
We go back. We go back where we came from.

2155
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:51,816
Yeah. Yeah.

2156
01:38:51,816 --> 01:38:54,566
Because if from the
I think. I thought that was cheese.

2157
01:38:54,683 --> 01:38:56,283
I think we can go down this way.

2158
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:58,883
Yeah, it looks like cheese.

2159
01:38:58,883 --> 01:39:00,966
And then it look at the objective. Said
it was like four out of five.

2160
01:39:00,966 --> 01:39:02,216
I like. Wait.

2161
01:39:03,366 --> 01:39:05,066
You think it was? Yeah.

2162
01:39:05,066 --> 01:39:05,766
Let me ask you something.

2163
01:39:05,766 --> 01:39:08,783
Do you think it was cheese
or was a teeny bit.

2164
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:11,466
Guys, guys, guys. Cheese.

2165
01:39:11,466 --> 01:39:12,850
I need to run out.

2166
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:15,033
This place is. Burning.

2167
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,716
Oh, my God. He's going.

2168
01:39:17,766 --> 01:39:19,266
To shine the light shine the light shine.

2169
01:39:19,266 --> 01:39:19,683
Right.

2170
01:39:24,233 --> 01:39:24,866
Oh, no.

2171
01:39:24,866 --> 01:39:27,416
Hold on, guys, guys,

2172
01:39:27,416 --> 01:39:32,966
I shit.

2173
01:39:34,283 --> 01:39:36,233
I had to run. I had to run.

2174
01:39:36,233 --> 01:39:37,683
I think I found it

2175
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:38,783
oh, this is just.

2176
01:39:38,783 --> 01:39:42,266
It's just the fucking trees again.

2177
01:39:42,266 --> 01:39:44,066
All my friends are dying.

2178
01:39:44,066 --> 01:39:46,350
All my friends are dying.

2179
01:39:51,366 --> 01:39:52,950
Oh, I could flip pasture.

2180
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:56,516
Fuck, no, dude.

2181
01:39:56,516 --> 01:39:57,716
I thought we could just.

2182
01:39:57,716 --> 01:40:01,133
Slip faster after, like,
flashing her with the lights on. It's

2183
01:40:05,066 --> 01:40:06,183
and on.

2184
01:40:06,183 --> 01:40:07,800
Oh, my gosh.

2185
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,766
I tried to flusher
than, like, slide by by.

2186
01:40:10,766 --> 01:40:12,083
Couldn't do that.

2187
01:40:12,483 --> 01:40:16,166
Yeah, I got jumped by the big dude,
and I don't think that there's.

2188
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:16,950
Others die from.

2189
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:18,866
Yeah, everyone died. Hey,
that's good, though.

2190
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:20,816
I don't think you can stop him.

2191
01:40:20,816 --> 01:40:23,233
We did find something new.
We found a table we.

2192
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,500
We did find a table with a rib cage on it.

2193
01:40:26,033 --> 01:40:27,383
A rib cage.

2194
01:40:27,383 --> 01:40:30,233
Where? Yeah. Huh.

2195
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:31,433
I think we need a box.

2196
01:40:31,433 --> 01:40:34,283
Are you OK, Foxy? Good. Yes, I jobs. Nice.

2197
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:36,716
I'm going. Nigel, move.

2198
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:40,200
I yawned and I almost like I yawned really
hard, and I almost went like.

2199
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,833
Oh, you. Oh.

2200
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:46,416
Oh, oh, I like that.

2201
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:47,616
And I miss the lasagne.

2202
01:40:47,616 --> 01:40:50,133
I still. Oh.

2203
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:52,733
The cheese.

2204
01:40:52,733 --> 01:40:56,183
You got to go over them now. We only got.

2205
01:40:57,383 --> 01:40:58,200
One to break from the.

2206
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,666
Ads. They were done.

2207
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:01,716
They want a break.

2208
01:41:01,716 --> 01:41:03,683
For. Oh.

2209
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:06,666
Now the watch is short. Oh.

2210
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:07,133
My God.

2211
01:41:07,133 --> 01:41:10,133
Was like your grunts very aggressive.

2212
01:41:10,216 --> 01:41:11,633
That's right. That's right.

2213
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:15,300
Just watch a short
ad and get 30 seconds of ad free.

2214
01:41:16,866 --> 01:41:18,650
Right.

2215
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:20,700
Considered to be sold all.

2216
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,483
Round. As like Alex does with my.

2217
01:41:23,483 --> 01:41:27,966
Favourite sound effect is the one
who is like 11 to break from the ads.

2218
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:30,916
One of my favourites.

2219
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:32,700
Many like a clip.

2220
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:37,083
It's a video I called Pan talked before
and it's just like a pair of hands

2221
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:39,600
flying towards the camera
and then it fades to white with the.

2222
01:41:39,816 --> 01:41:42,966
Weird sound effect.

2223
01:41:42,966 --> 01:41:43,883
But you cheese here.

2224
01:41:43,883 --> 01:41:44,916
Put it in and put the cheese.

2225
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:45,666
I got one.

2226
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,833
Yeah, but the cheese.

2227
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:49,016
And it looks like a cheese. Yeah.

2228
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,316
I mean. She's.

2229
01:41:51,316 --> 01:41:52,283
A cheese. Do you.

2230
01:41:52,283 --> 01:41:54,116
What kind of fucking cheese.

2231
01:41:54,116 --> 01:41:56,016
Hold on. Fucking cheese.

2232
01:41:56,016 --> 01:41:57,666
Cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese.

2233
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:58,866
I'm kind of concern now.

2234
01:41:58,866 --> 01:41:59,583
She's cheese.

2235
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:00,750
Fucking cheese.

2236
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,616
Next week we'll be looking at egg.

2237
01:42:04,316 --> 01:42:06,216
Thank you to oh, yeah.

2238
01:42:06,216 --> 01:42:08,316
I know exactly what he's referencing.

2239
01:42:08,316 --> 01:42:10,483
Is there another European thing?
I don't know.

2240
01:42:10,716 --> 01:42:11,866
No, I mean.

2241
01:42:11,866 --> 01:42:12,366
You know.

2242
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:13,483
Technically, I guess.

2243
01:42:13,483 --> 01:42:16,133
OK, just James, maybe oh.

2244
01:42:16,133 --> 01:42:16,683
My God.

2245
01:42:16,683 --> 01:42:18,433
We need to find the greens with the sweet.

2246
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:20,183
All right, go to the greenhouse house.

2247
01:42:20,183 --> 01:42:20,766
I will.

2248
01:42:20,766 --> 01:42:22,716
I will be the green house.

2249
01:42:22,716 --> 01:42:24,783
I've never even seen it.
You never seen the green house?

2250
01:42:24,816 --> 01:42:25,700
Haven't I?

2251
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:28,166
Oh. Has gone there. Before. Yeah, I don't.

2252
01:42:28,166 --> 01:42:28,733
I don't remember.

2253
01:42:28,733 --> 01:42:30,383
OK, we went down this way like the one.

2254
01:42:30,383 --> 01:42:32,550
In the field with all the dry grass.

2255
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:34,083
No, no, no. That's where I got the seal.

2256
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,933
And you are walking over the trees.
I know.

2257
01:42:35,933 --> 01:42:36,066
Yeah.

2258
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:37,866
The first time I got to the greenhouse

2259
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:41,483
was when, like, everybody separated
and got super fucking scared.

2260
01:42:41,616 --> 01:42:43,616
It was like
I was trying to look for Ike, and then.

2261
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:45,150
Oh, no.

2262
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:46,966
Oh, you were with me,
and then you disappeared.

2263
01:42:46,966 --> 01:42:49,350
And then I just saw a player
that I was like, oh.

2264
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:52,983
Wait a second down here. Oh,

2265
01:42:54,183 --> 01:42:55,716
One of the few places where I'm.

2266
01:42:55,716 --> 01:42:56,550
Like, breathing.

2267
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:57,266
Trying to communicate.

2268
01:42:57,266 --> 01:43:01,200
Yeah, I remember
I was falling asleep, all gone.

2269
01:43:01,533 --> 01:43:01,983
All right.

2270
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:04,683
I remember I was following Ike's thing
because I was like, oh, shit.

2271
01:43:04,683 --> 01:43:06,300
I see his his lights on.

2272
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,083
We follow it,
and then I think I split off here.

2273
01:43:09,333 --> 01:43:12,216
No, not here. We hear

2274
01:43:12,666 --> 01:43:14,016
because, like, I didn't

2275
01:43:14,016 --> 01:43:17,166
end up following the lights at some point.

2276
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:18,233
Folks.

2277
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,566
Sorry. Sorry.

2278
01:43:19,566 --> 01:43:20,033
I think

2279
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:23,916
OK, now I don't know where to go.

2280
01:43:27,516 --> 01:43:28,800
I'm going to lose my glow.

2281
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,416
Big chunk. This is very close.

2282
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:32,316
Yeah.

2283
01:43:32,566 --> 01:43:35,933
This is a big boy.

2284
01:43:35,933 --> 01:43:39,483
Big, big I.

2285
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:43,866
Hate this game.

2286
01:43:43,866 --> 01:43:47,166
We I can't even get in.

2287
01:43:47,183 --> 01:43:48,683
This is playground.

2288
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,733
It's wall place again.

2289
01:43:50,816 --> 01:43:51,966
Where do we go from here?

2290
01:43:51,966 --> 01:43:53,316
Because we found you places.

2291
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:55,433
For our follow me follow me. Follow me.

2292
01:43:55,433 --> 01:43:57,516
I think I saw another area.
Unless it's a dead end.

2293
01:43:57,516 --> 01:43:58,833
I'm not sure if it's a dead end or not.

2294
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:04,016
This monster's over there.

2295
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:05,916
Or the big guys.

2296
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:07,566
Like he's
on. He's on the other side of the trees.

2297
01:44:07,566 --> 01:44:08,483
It's OK. It's ok.

2298
01:44:08,483 --> 01:44:11,066
Oh, this is a dead end.
A fuck. Oh, lovely.

2299
01:44:11,183 --> 01:44:15,516
Oh, we need to go to the big guy,
then mm hmm.

2300
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,516
Or kill.

2301
01:44:17,516 --> 01:44:20,766
You. Oh, Kony, you are.

2302
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:25,116
Hiding the master.

2303
01:44:26,516 --> 01:44:28,116
I'm not you. You need to run.

2304
01:44:28,116 --> 01:44:29,100
We just got you the fun, right?

2305
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,333
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I guess so.

2306
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,483
Yeah, down here.

2307
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,083
He's been.

2308
01:44:33,083 --> 01:44:34,050
Down here.

2309
01:44:37,716 --> 01:44:39,266
My God, this game is hard.

2310
01:44:39,266 --> 01:44:41,100
I wish we had, like, a man.
He was. Really there.

2311
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,450
Ow, ow.

2312
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:46,283
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.

2313
01:44:46,533 --> 01:44:48,600
Well, is this is this, like, baptism?

2314
01:44:48,933 --> 01:44:52,150
What that tells me, Daddy?

2315
01:44:52,683 --> 01:44:53,250
I mean, the.

2316
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,550
Opposite of what whoa.

2317
01:44:55,566 --> 01:44:56,466
Waffle.

2318
01:44:57,116 --> 01:44:57,533
Daddy.

2319
01:44:57,533 --> 01:44:58,566
Father. Excuse me.

2320
01:44:58,566 --> 01:45:00,783
Excuse me. It's baptised me, father.

2321
01:45:01,733 --> 01:45:03,700
And said father.

2322
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:06,000
So I'll check the board, guys.

2323
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,200
We all heard what she said.

2324
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,866
Forgive me, Daddy, for I have sinned.

2325
01:45:11,016 --> 01:45:12,983
Oh, you are, bitch.

2326
01:45:12,983 --> 01:45:15,483
What sakuma you are fucking bitch.

2327
01:45:23,316 --> 01:45:25,416
I really hope
this is the way I see my girls.

2328
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:28,633
Y'all, let's go. Let's go.

2329
01:45:28,733 --> 01:45:30,233
We found it.

2330
01:45:30,233 --> 01:45:32,016
Yeah. Ok.

2331
01:45:32,016 --> 01:45:33,833
We like some sort of acid.

2332
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:36,716
There's, like, a body inside.

2333
01:45:36,716 --> 01:45:37,683
We shit. Yeah.

2334
01:45:37,683 --> 01:45:41,816
Now we got to, like, make the make
the pesticide solution somehow.

2335
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:43,416
Yeah, it's on the other side.

2336
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:45,450
There's a there's a chemistry table,

2337
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:48,966
and then you have to follow the
instructions and mix the shit together.

2338
01:45:48,966 --> 01:45:51,650
OK. Ok, let me see

2339
01:45:52,733 --> 01:45:54,266
sam behind.

2340
01:45:54,266 --> 01:45:56,466
We have to come on. Pesticides
just make my own.

2341
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:57,533
The fuck is this?

2342
01:45:57,533 --> 01:45:59,483
I feel chemistry twice. Yes,

2343
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,683
I see.

2344
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,733
Oh. Yeah.

2345
01:46:05,733 --> 01:46:06,716
I took.

2346
01:46:06,716 --> 01:46:09,450
I took AP, and I don't even remember
any of this shit.

2347
01:46:10,016 --> 01:46:11,533
It's a blur.

2348
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,833
I, like, threw it out my head.

2349
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:14,833
It was over.

2350
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,316
Canvas and jet.

2351
01:46:16,316 --> 01:46:16,533
Yeah.

2352
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:19,283
Any chemists and shot

2353
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,283
guys?

2354
01:46:20,283 --> 01:46:22,316
How do we how do we how do we make liquid?

2355
01:46:23,783 --> 01:46:26,066
What is cb

2356
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:28,200
t. D i

2357
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,383
we had these yellow and green dye
and you just drop it with another bottle.

2358
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:33,183
It just kind of reminds you like.

2359
01:46:33,183 --> 01:46:34,716
CBT. Like resident evil.

2360
01:46:34,716 --> 01:46:36,983
Hey, know, key yogi.

2361
01:46:36,983 --> 01:46:40,500
If this game was
if this game was forgiving

2362
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,783
we could just hop through the ceiling
like this.

2363
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:48,666
If it honestly, I feel like I would
I would rather just do that.

2364
01:46:48,666 --> 01:46:52,316
Just jump up and no, we have like is zero
athletic abilities apparently.

2365
01:46:52,916 --> 01:46:56,716
At age
seven from Brett to yellow need a bottle

2366
01:46:59,033 --> 01:47:00,600
so we need to find bottles.

2367
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,966
Oh let's divide colour bottles.

2368
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:06,333
We have to find more
we have to find more shit.

2369
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:09,416
Yeah of course
we need to find the chemical anatomy.

2370
01:47:09,816 --> 01:47:11,016
Hide, hide, hide company.

2371
01:47:11,016 --> 01:47:12,633
Come with me. Hide, hide, hide.

2372
01:47:12,633 --> 01:47:15,116
Overzealous. No, you see some. Stores.

2373
01:47:15,116 --> 01:47:16,733
I see source. Oh my God.

2374
01:47:16,733 --> 01:47:19,566
It's all in my purse.

2375
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:28,800
I heard his little all.

2376
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:36,283
Famous.

2377
01:47:40,766 --> 01:47:43,466
Oh, I think he's gone.

2378
01:47:43,466 --> 01:47:44,616
He's gone. Yeah.

2379
01:47:44,616 --> 01:47:48,066
I think the trick is just say Ryan
and then just let it one day.

2380
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:55,016
When we know the different coloured
bottles are right here.

2381
01:47:55,283 --> 01:47:56,483
These are the bottles contain.

2382
01:47:56,483 --> 01:47:58,550
Green shaking occasionally.

2383
01:47:58,566 --> 01:48:01,383
So far,
this is a mixture. Evaporation evaporates.

2384
01:48:01,416 --> 01:48:05,433
Yellows that mean you do. It
evaporates, it becomes gas.

2385
01:48:05,633 --> 01:48:08,166
You know what evaporates? Yes,
I know what it means.

2386
01:48:08,166 --> 01:48:09,983
Do you know what some. Of the water has?

2387
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:10,333
You know what?

2388
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:12,066
Sublimation. Oh, wait.

2389
01:48:12,066 --> 01:48:13,433
We don't need to find anything.

2390
01:48:13,433 --> 01:48:16,033
All the ingredients
are right in front of us.

2391
01:48:17,066 --> 01:48:17,783
That's all.

2392
01:48:17,783 --> 01:48:18,983
Saying.

2393
01:48:18,983 --> 01:48:20,950
What the hell.

2394
01:48:22,116 --> 01:48:25,116
I ain't notice it basically fed this.

2395
01:48:25,116 --> 01:48:25,566
Stuff.

2396
01:48:25,683 --> 01:48:28,233
The volume bottles are literally right in
front of us.

2397
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:30,566
And I need to swap it with another bottle.

2398
01:48:30,866 --> 01:48:33,866
Yeah, coverage nine from red, yellow.

2399
01:48:35,433 --> 01:48:36,866
Seven feet.

2400
01:48:36,866 --> 01:48:39,866
I don't.

2401
01:48:39,866 --> 01:48:41,850
One person that's not here, dude.

2402
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:44,466
All the solutions keep evaporating

2403
01:48:45,533 --> 01:48:47,033
this blood.

2404
01:48:47,033 --> 01:48:48,983
C, c b breaking down in all.

2405
01:48:48,983 --> 01:48:50,666
But is it separate this a lot?

2406
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:54,366
I think I need to, like, write them
all down in, like, a big notepad.

2407
01:48:54,366 --> 01:48:55,866
So I don't forget.

2408
01:48:55,866 --> 01:48:56,783
I keep lying.

2409
01:48:56,783 --> 01:48:59,216
Oh, I love cock and ball torture.

2410
01:48:59,216 --> 01:49:01,283
Where is this? You stay here.

2411
01:49:01,283 --> 01:49:03,150
Oh, shit. Run.

2412
01:49:03,183 --> 01:49:04,433
I've got a solution.

2413
01:49:04,433 --> 01:49:06,533
This lady. Oh, no, I don't. Come here.
Come here.

2414
01:49:06,533 --> 01:49:09,316
I don't think. Lady screams
when you see us. We can hide.

2415
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:11,483
Little lady is going to.
She sees us. There's no way to.

2416
01:49:15,933 --> 01:49:16,766
Ever get.

2417
01:49:27,783 --> 01:49:28,200
Sunlight.

2418
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,766
Shine the light shine.

2419
01:49:30,633 --> 01:49:31,933
OK, OK.

2420
01:49:40,316 --> 01:49:41,250
Daniel, I've been worried.

2421
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:41,850
I think

2422
01:49:43,766 --> 01:49:44,833
damn.

2423
01:49:45,866 --> 01:49:46,883
Oh, my God.

2424
01:49:46,883 --> 01:49:47,333
He caught me.

2425
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:49,500
I can't hide from her. No.

2426
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:54,483
Damn, it's me.

2427
01:49:55,166 --> 01:49:58,566
Oh. Ha ha ha ha.

2428
01:50:03,366 --> 01:50:06,533
All God damn it, man.

2429
01:50:09,633 --> 01:50:11,666
All three people died on her.

2430
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:13,316
What happens like.

2431
01:50:13,466 --> 01:50:15,416
That? Like, fuck.

2432
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:18,783
Do we solve any of this?

2433
01:50:18,783 --> 01:50:20,733
How the fuck do we do that chemical thing?

2434
01:50:20,733 --> 01:50:23,633
I don't know that that makes any sense.

2435
01:50:23,633 --> 01:50:26,033
Everything else has made complete sense.
That one just doesn't.

2436
01:50:26,033 --> 01:50:28,200
Think it's a crime.
I should speak with that manager.

2437
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,733
You don't say. All you want to.

2438
01:50:29,733 --> 01:50:31,866
All you want to sell them
like we asked for.

2439
01:50:31,866 --> 01:50:33,233
No pickles.

2440
01:50:33,983 --> 01:50:35,216
Excuse me?

2441
01:50:35,216 --> 01:50:38,766
Sure to ask for no pickles.

2442
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,083
You are.

2443
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:44,316
Are you the type of person to just tell
them, like, hey, I don't want pickles?

2444
01:50:44,316 --> 01:50:48,666
Or, like, you know, you order it, but then
you take it off after you've ordered it.

2445
01:50:49,166 --> 01:50:50,633
Yeah, it depends. I mean.

2446
01:50:50,633 --> 01:50:54,366
I mean, if I'm in, like, a restaurant,
then I'll just be like, oh,

2447
01:50:54,366 --> 01:50:55,266
yeah, I'd really like this.

2448
01:50:55,266 --> 01:50:56,766
Oh, fuck, can I have this instead of that?

2449
01:50:56,766 --> 01:50:59,516
And in a restaurant, because it takes so
long to prepare the food, then they don't.

2450
01:50:59,616 --> 01:51:02,583
They usually it's like, not, it's like,
really not, not a problem for them.

2451
01:51:02,933 --> 01:51:04,683
Whereas in, like, fast food,
I will just be.

2452
01:51:04,683 --> 01:51:05,966
I'll just take it off.

2453
01:51:05,966 --> 01:51:06,516
Yeah.

2454
01:51:06,516 --> 01:51:08,383
I just take it off as a matter. I don't.

2455
01:51:08,383 --> 01:51:10,433
I really don't like pickles.

2456
01:51:10,433 --> 01:51:12,066
Oh, you don't like pickles?

2457
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:15,150
Nah, you'll like like pickles, like,

2458
01:51:15,266 --> 01:51:18,366
not even pickled
like I'll open yours or like. No.

2459
01:51:18,683 --> 01:51:21,066
Like pickled radish. Pickles just loose.

2460
01:51:21,183 --> 01:51:22,500
I just don't like pickle.

2461
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,666
Just the. Texture.

2462
01:51:23,666 --> 01:51:25,416
Dichotomy. Mostly the texture of a pickle.

2463
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:28,833
Like when I bite into it, you're
not expecting it to be there in a burger.

2464
01:51:28,833 --> 01:51:29,550
It's like, look.

2465
01:51:30,966 --> 01:51:32,633
Have you
ever had, like, other pickled stuff

2466
01:51:32,633 --> 01:51:36,566
that's not like, you know, the cucumbers,
like, daikon radish or like kimchi?

2467
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:37,416
I don't know

2468
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:39,216
what kind of pickle.

2469
01:51:39,216 --> 01:51:41,383
I think

2470
01:51:41,466 --> 01:51:42,483
I think

2471
01:51:43,716 --> 01:51:46,050
we removed in die

2472
01:51:48,633 --> 01:51:49,716
or Removed and Die.

2473
01:51:49,716 --> 01:51:51,966
And she's still communicating.

2474
01:51:51,966 --> 01:51:53,100
All right.

2475
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:54,833
My favourite thing about the voice chat in

2476
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,016
this game is the fact that you can hear it
just cut through.

2477
01:51:57,066 --> 01:52:01,816
Yeah, we hear them like Oh.

2478
01:52:02,433 --> 01:52:03,966
What's the fuck is this, bro?

2479
01:52:03,966 --> 01:52:05,516
What is. This?

2480
01:52:05,516 --> 01:52:07,800
Wait, what the fuck is this?

2481
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,783
What is this?

2482
01:52:08,783 --> 01:52:10,500
I've never seen this part before.

2483
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,733
Apparently it's already solved
because like, I think they got it via

2484
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,416
already, but.

2485
01:52:17,883 --> 01:52:20,766
Oh. Interesting.

2486
01:52:21,266 --> 01:52:22,833
It was another.

2487
01:52:23,966 --> 01:52:25,833
All in the cage.

2488
01:52:27,266 --> 01:52:28,766
Nah. That

2489
01:52:28,766 --> 01:52:31,866
close behind me or just kind of
just kind of fantasise about getting me.

2490
01:52:31,883 --> 01:52:35,250
I'm like getting back by about having
my back against the wall for one second.

2491
01:52:35,633 --> 01:52:37,583
Or both in the cage now.

2492
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:39,450
Oh shit. Are both in the cage now.

2493
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:41,033
Are we going to do.
What are we going to do?

2494
01:52:41,033 --> 01:52:43,116
But they're not here.
They're not listening. They don't know

2495
01:52:44,183 --> 01:52:44,550
they're not.

2496
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:45,383
We're in the cage.

2497
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:49,650
They don't know and all the time
the monsters aren't even here either.

2498
01:52:50,016 --> 01:52:52,066
The moon's high in the sky at all time.

2499
01:52:52,633 --> 01:52:53,583
All the time in the world.

2500
01:52:53,583 --> 01:52:55,616
Yeah, yeah.

2501
01:52:55,616 --> 01:52:57,383
No rush, right?

2502
01:52:57,383 --> 01:52:57,866
Yeah, yeah.

2503
01:52:57,866 --> 01:53:00,866
We're never going

2504
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,616
to leave.

2505
01:53:01,616 --> 01:53:06,083
That's just the gentle swaying of a cage
upon the branches of a tree.

2506
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:09,300
But the way you articulate things, it's
very sexy.

2507
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:13,066
You know, like the gentle
swinging of the trees and the

2508
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,566
land and buzzing on high

2509
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:21,066
wealth of branches dangling
through the the bars of the cage.

2510
01:53:21,783 --> 01:53:24,383
And your beard is like brushing
against my head.

2511
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:28,266
Bush push.

2512
01:53:29,433 --> 01:53:30,716
It's like I'm getting, like, you know,

2513
01:53:30,716 --> 01:53:34,500
those those head massagers, like,
those weird long ones.

2514
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:37,250
You just, like,
go in and out of your head. No.

2515
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,333
Oh, yeah. It's like a spy. Like.

2516
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:41,316
When you use them on a cat
in the Catholic.

2517
01:53:41,316 --> 01:53:43,683
Movies. You've used on a cat before.

2518
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:44,983
Yeah, you can.

2519
01:53:44,983 --> 01:53:47,166
Yeah,
that's what I thought I was talking about.

2520
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:49,650
Like this note
like the sort of the metal prong thingy

2521
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:52,766
that when you push it on someone's
head, it kind of spreads out OK.

2522
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,816
Anyway, stick your pants off

2523
01:53:57,383 --> 01:53:57,783
Jesus.

2524
01:53:57,783 --> 01:54:01,250
All right. Ha ha ha ha ha.

2525
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:03,233
You're. Like, flabbergasted for.

2526
01:54:03,233 --> 01:54:05,666
I was really talking, like,
I was expecting it earlier.

2527
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:08,700
And then we got into this cat massage
discussion, and I was really aggressive.

2528
01:54:08,783 --> 01:54:13,250
Oh, hey, this is the rib cage
that they're talking about it.

2529
01:54:13,766 --> 01:54:15,066
Is that a pun?

2530
01:54:16,616 --> 01:54:19,083
Oh, it's a rib cage.

2531
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:20,400
Inside a cage.

2532
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,166
You know, that's pretty clever.

2533
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:24,383
I see. I see. That's a felony. Yeah.

2534
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:27,116
You got to take credit for those.
Very good. Very good.

2535
01:54:27,116 --> 01:54:29,166
Months and months.

2536
01:54:29,166 --> 01:54:31,566
Not something I associate with you
on the best of days.

2537
01:54:31,983 --> 01:54:34,500
Well, come on, bro. We like have you.

2538
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:36,966
We played through the entirety
of its excuse.

2539
01:54:36,966 --> 01:54:40,466
The other, it takes of, like,
a considerable amount of grey matter.

2540
01:54:40,466 --> 01:54:42,233
Yeah. You know, chief, such a feel.

2541
01:54:42,233 --> 01:54:44,750
Like you did have me. You did have me.

2542
01:54:46,716 --> 01:54:48,116
What the fuck it was?

2543
01:54:48,116 --> 01:54:49,983
It was a dual effort.

2544
01:54:49,983 --> 01:54:50,633
I mean, you had to.

2545
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:53,116
It was like. Yeah, it's like saying. Well.

2546
01:54:53,133 --> 01:54:54,950
I mean, yeah, it's like saying.
You're the one.

2547
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:57,133
The only ones in the entirety of the show
probably.

2548
01:54:57,150 --> 01:54:59,783
Isn't allowed to do, but, you know,

2549
01:55:00,566 --> 01:55:03,166
all they got the chains.

2550
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:04,350
All they were back here.

2551
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:07,650
What's that coherent arse neighbourhood.

2552
01:55:07,916 --> 01:55:08,633
Yeah.

2553
01:55:09,533 --> 01:55:11,666
They're facing their arses
towards each other.

2554
01:55:11,666 --> 01:55:12,683
You give them.

2555
01:55:12,683 --> 01:55:15,266
Both bottles because they're facing
their arses towards each other.

2556
01:55:16,283 --> 01:55:17,600
I might be right.

2557
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:18,983
And the how that works.

2558
01:55:18,983 --> 01:55:19,983
I don't know

2559
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:23,316
I don't know.

2560
01:55:24,366 --> 01:55:25,166
The back of your shirts.

2561
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:26,616
A staff

2562
01:55:27,683 --> 01:55:28,350
and a staff.

2563
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:31,166
Are you just

2564
01:55:31,266 --> 01:55:33,183
you got to check in my pants for that.

2565
01:55:33,183 --> 01:55:35,783
Oh, it's impressive.

2566
01:55:36,483 --> 01:55:38,100
I seems kind of flaccid right now.

2567
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:38,966
I think so.

2568
01:55:38,966 --> 01:55:39,933
Colour flaccid.

2569
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:41,650
Is probably cause I'm around you.

2570
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:44,383
All. You are your bitch. OK, goodbye.

2571
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,716
Welcome back.

2572
01:55:49,733 --> 01:55:51,866
Fuck you. What the hell?

2573
01:55:51,866 --> 01:55:55,416
Get back here. I'll

2574
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:03,966
you little bitch.

2575
01:56:03,966 --> 01:56:04,716
I see you.

2576
01:56:04,716 --> 01:56:06,150
You all right?

2577
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,883
Oh, you finally decided to come
crawling back?

2578
01:56:07,883 --> 01:56:09,683
No, I decided. To come crawling back.

2579
01:56:09,683 --> 01:56:11,966
I just don't want to be alone.

2580
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:13,350
Oh, boy.

2581
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,083
You should shut the fuck up, Vox.

2582
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:16,750
I just don't wanna be. All.

2583
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:18,600
That fucking thing.

2584
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,633
Don't look at me, dudes.

2585
01:56:19,633 --> 01:56:22,016
I'll look around you lot of people.

2586
01:56:22,533 --> 01:56:24,716
Oh, well, that was a close one.

2587
01:56:24,716 --> 01:56:28,383
Yeah, I would have been really bad,
especially after I said, Oh,

2588
01:56:29,033 --> 01:56:31,050
I think they figure. You did it. Yeah,
they figured it out.

2589
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,450
I think they did it while I was trying
get back to the main place.

2590
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:34,133
Yeah, that's.

2591
01:56:34,133 --> 01:56:39,000
Well, we decided to just fuck around
inside a cage for, like, 10 minutes.

2592
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,733
They solve the puzzle
I guess we. Have our own little story.

2593
01:56:41,733 --> 01:56:42,750
OK? OK. Yeah,

2594
01:56:43,866 --> 01:56:45,450
it's like in the until dawn.

2595
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:45,900
There were plans.

2596
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:49,133
Although I did. Yeah, I've played.

2597
01:56:49,166 --> 01:56:50,966
I mean,
I don't think I've played it myself.

2598
01:56:50,966 --> 01:56:53,133
I think I watched somebody play it, like,
three years ago.

2599
01:56:54,016 --> 01:56:55,416
This is the right way.

2600
01:56:55,416 --> 01:56:57,566
I think it is. Yeah, it's familiar.

2601
01:56:58,583 --> 01:57:01,416
All this, I think, is the way back to the.

2602
01:57:01,416 --> 01:57:03,900
Scenes from me.

2603
01:57:05,016 --> 01:57:07,233
OK, Morgan Freeman

2604
01:57:08,183 --> 01:57:10,050
to the thing again.

2605
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:12,900
I do believe
we've gone the wrong way, my boy.

2606
01:57:12,933 --> 01:57:16,466
Yeah, I think there's probably not
the Morgan Freeman.

2607
01:57:17,216 --> 01:57:17,850
Oh, I found it.

2608
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:20,933
What's that one out of 75 young men

2609
01:57:22,433 --> 01:57:23,933
on this? Wait, wait.

2610
01:57:23,933 --> 01:57:26,166
Haven't we already been down this way?

2611
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:28,133
We just come down here.

2612
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,616
One out of two young men is a bottom.

2613
01:57:32,883 --> 01:57:34,466
I'm Morgan Freeman.

2614
01:57:34,466 --> 01:57:38,433
One out of 20.

2615
01:57:38,766 --> 01:57:40,083
Hello, hello. Hello.

2616
01:57:43,533 --> 01:57:46,200
All good thing neither of us are that one.

2617
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,483
Artsy two, right?

2618
01:57:47,483 --> 01:57:49,533
We're like a statistical anomaly

2619
01:57:49,983 --> 01:57:52,200
or like an alley. Is

2620
01:57:53,333 --> 01:57:54,416
it's like that fucking thing

2621
01:57:54,416 --> 01:57:57,233
of, like, you know, about one in three
people are a bottom.

2622
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:58,266
And we look at that.

2623
01:57:58,266 --> 01:58:00,183
We look at them either,
and they just stare.

2624
01:58:00,183 --> 01:58:03,083
We just look at the screen. Yeah.

2625
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:05,516
And the in this case,
I just you to look at them.

2626
01:58:05,783 --> 01:58:08,366
Mm hmm. You know,
one and two people are bottoms.

2627
01:58:08,366 --> 01:58:09,533
I'm not a bottom.

2628
01:58:09,533 --> 01:58:11,516
I'm not a bomb either.

2629
01:58:12,516 --> 01:58:14,816
No, no, just don't look anywhere.

2630
01:58:14,816 --> 01:58:18,300
One and two. Mm

2631
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,016
I couldn't even see your face.

2632
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:28,466
It was, like,
obscured by the fucking shot.

2633
01:58:28,466 --> 01:58:31,350
No, no, the joke's ruined. Fuck

2634
01:58:34,766 --> 01:58:36,833
and we're actually the lost boys.

2635
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:37,283
Well.

2636
01:58:38,733 --> 01:58:39,666
This is back at the.

2637
01:58:39,666 --> 01:58:40,650
No, this is the.

2638
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:43,166
This is just one point. Yeah, what's.

2639
01:58:43,433 --> 01:58:46,733
I'll cabin in the woods.

2640
01:58:49,283 --> 01:58:50,250
Oh, my goodness.

2641
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:50,816
I'm going.

2642
01:58:50,816 --> 01:58:54,450
So I'm going to I, you know, I feel like

2643
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,633
like just ripping out a rotisserie chicken
right now.

2644
01:58:57,633 --> 01:59:00,933
I'm just, like, eating it with my bare
hands.

2645
01:59:00,933 --> 01:59:01,866
I like you being.

2646
01:59:01,866 --> 01:59:04,866
Like, the dude on that Australian
news thing where he's like,

2647
01:59:04,866 --> 01:59:07,016
yeah, you know, that creature
just kind of came out was like,

2648
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,350
you know, can you eat it like that?

2649
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,483
I wish I could.

2650
01:59:11,483 --> 01:59:14,633
Mr. Fox, you know, where he just sits down
to kind of fold his newspaper.

2651
01:59:14,633 --> 01:59:15,483
He's all dressed, all smart.

2652
01:59:15,483 --> 01:59:17,916
It's like, Darling,
this dinner looks fantastic.

2653
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:19,200
And he just looks at he goes, Well,

2654
01:59:20,266 --> 01:59:21,183
has to, to shreds like that,

2655
01:59:21,183 --> 01:59:23,366
like an actual fox and goes,
and then he just kind of like.

2656
01:59:23,366 --> 01:59:24,566
Mops his mouth.

2657
01:59:24,966 --> 01:59:28,433
Oh, oh, nah, nah.

2658
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,116
Our friends just die our Amaar

2659
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,833
from my knee. Ron

2660
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:40,083
loves my way the right way.

2661
01:59:40,266 --> 01:59:42,633
All this does
this do look like the bloody right way.

2662
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:44,966
Oh, my goodness. Holy shit.

2663
01:59:45,183 --> 01:59:47,066
Harry, pull out all you fuck me.

2664
01:59:47,066 --> 01:59:49,950
Did they call me the Harry Potter?

2665
01:59:49,950 --> 01:59:51,216
Wait. Did you find Ike?

2666
01:59:51,216 --> 01:59:52,500
Do you know where I was?

2667
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,733
I think I died.

2668
01:59:53,733 --> 01:59:55,416
I was with me, and then we got separated.

2669
01:59:55,416 --> 01:59:57,450
And then I opened this, and then.

2670
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:58,050
Boom.

2671
01:59:59,316 --> 02:00:00,083
I was were.

2672
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,833
Like. We.

2673
02:00:01,833 --> 02:00:03,666
I just found Volks, like, Nazi long ago.

2674
02:00:03,666 --> 02:00:05,766
Yeah, he just got.

2675
02:00:05,766 --> 02:00:08,483
So I guess I was the one that died. Yeah.

2676
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,966
I think he'll be back soon.

2677
02:00:09,966 --> 02:00:11,100
We chill here.

2678
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,766
We for the boys can wait here. I

2679
02:00:16,866 --> 02:00:20,933
ike. I think I see him coming home.

2680
02:00:21,366 --> 02:00:23,366
Oh, yeah, that is him. OK.

2681
02:00:23,366 --> 02:00:23,950
Let's go.

2682
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:26,700
Oh, I'm so.

2683
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,400
I looked away for a split second,
and you vanish.

2684
02:00:29,733 --> 02:00:31,866
Things like that.

2685
02:00:31,916 --> 02:00:35,066
So I guess I have the blessed child
of this game who aren't you.

2686
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:37,633
A blessed child?

2687
02:00:37,633 --> 02:00:39,466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2688
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,666
Thank God for our

2689
02:00:43,166 --> 02:00:45,233
and God for our ghost.

2690
02:00:45,233 --> 02:00:46,866
What is that achievement?

2691
02:00:46,866 --> 02:00:47,333
What was.

2692
02:00:47,333 --> 02:00:48,383
What treatment?

2693
02:00:48,383 --> 02:00:50,850
Did you. Get one? Is it green?

2694
02:00:51,666 --> 02:00:54,116
50 shades of green.

2695
02:00:55,983 --> 02:00:58,233
It's 50 Shades of Grey,
but it's starring Shrek.

2696
02:00:58,683 --> 02:01:00,300
Oh, boy.

2697
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:03,116
I mean, are you doing in my boxer shorts?

2698
02:01:05,783 --> 02:01:06,933
Yeah, I are.

2699
02:01:06,933 --> 02:01:09,416
We got
I don't know, it looks like a swamp.

2700
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,966
We might actually be on to a swamp.

2701
02:01:11,966 --> 02:01:14,850
I love Shrek. I love T-Rex. So much.

2702
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:16,916
I had all of the DVDs. Oh.

2703
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:19,433
I see.

2704
02:01:19,433 --> 02:01:21,483
Oh, there's another house.

2705
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:23,583
Hello. Salem is a safe house.

2706
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:24,533
It's another thing.

2707
02:01:24,533 --> 02:01:27,383
To point to leaf in Japanese.

2708
02:01:27,466 --> 02:01:29,433
Stick symbols
whispering to me on the phone.

2709
02:01:29,433 --> 02:01:31,800
Oh, my God, my poor head.

2710
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,416
When I grabbed it, disintegrated
in my hands.

2711
02:01:35,466 --> 02:01:37,866
Oh. I have a question.

2712
02:01:37,866 --> 02:01:39,533
How did you guys solve the puzzle?

2713
02:01:39,533 --> 02:01:41,333
How do you solve the pesticide puzzle?

2714
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:44,250
I wrote each puzzle down,
and then I figure with the

2715
02:01:44,316 --> 02:01:47,850
with each note, we're like,
which chemist and which chemist?

2716
02:01:48,066 --> 02:01:49,983
Which solution was in which.

2717
02:01:49,983 --> 02:01:51,750
You pulled. Out your notes for this?

2718
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:53,016
Oh, my God, you're insane.

2719
02:01:53,016 --> 02:01:54,816
Yeah. Dude, I'm so proud of you.

2720
02:01:54,816 --> 02:01:56,433
I'm so proud of you.

2721
02:01:58,083 --> 02:01:59,183
All this was a job.

2722
02:01:59,183 --> 02:02:00,033
My phone.

2723
02:02:00,033 --> 02:02:01,283
I thought I was alone for

2724
02:02:01,283 --> 02:02:05,700
when I was warming up near the bonfire,
but that thing, it just ignored me.

2725
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:07,166
Like I wasn't even there.

2726
02:02:07,166 --> 02:02:09,266
Guys, guys, guys, gather up, gather tape.

2727
02:02:10,566 --> 02:02:11,283
If you're reading

2728
02:02:11,283 --> 02:02:13,566
this, stay near fire or indoors.

2729
02:02:14,283 --> 02:02:16,983
Oh. Stay near fire indoors.

2730
02:02:16,983 --> 02:02:18,366
OK. OK.

2731
02:02:18,366 --> 02:02:19,500
Noted

2732
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:23,550
guy died
because another guy set in his face

2733
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:27,033
sitting on face down yeah.

2734
02:02:27,216 --> 02:02:31,950
When I was working up near the bonfire,
I stay near fire or indoors.

2735
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:33,566
OK, that's. Why.

2736
02:02:33,566 --> 02:02:35,733
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2737
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:38,433
Oh, this is Dr.. Franklin.

2738
02:02:38,433 --> 02:02:40,683
I'm Sergeant with the Hapsburg
Illinois Police Force.

2739
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:43,316
At least they have a shifter
and coming me.

2740
02:02:43,316 --> 02:02:44,133
What time?

2741
02:02:44,133 --> 02:02:45,566
What about you?

2742
02:02:45,566 --> 02:02:49,283
Willing to bet that there's the plumbing.

2743
02:02:49,283 --> 02:02:51,416
Leaks that are somewhere, right?

2744
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,100
Busting all bitches.

2745
02:02:54,116 --> 02:02:55,500
No bitches.

2746
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,383
Nobody's and don't be near bitches

2747
02:02:58,833 --> 02:03:01,883
and you'll be OK.

2748
02:03:03,233 --> 02:03:04,950
What do you what do you guys want to do?

2749
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:06,383
I think.

2750
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,683
Do you want to you want to solve this one

2751
02:03:09,683 --> 02:03:11,633
and then call the night
after we solve this one?

2752
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,716
Am I the only
one like, OK, so if you look at the grass

2753
02:03:15,716 --> 02:03:18,983
graphics and all the trees here, doesn't
this look like slender, the eight pages?

2754
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,383
Oh, my. Oh,
my God. You're right. The tree.

2755
02:03:22,616 --> 02:03:23,966
Holy shit. You're right.

2756
02:03:23,966 --> 02:03:25,866
What a classic. Oh, my God.

2757
02:03:25,866 --> 02:03:27,133
Did you just give me a nostalgia?

2758
02:03:27,133 --> 02:03:29,616
Footsteps even sound similar.

2759
02:03:29,616 --> 02:03:32,450
All we need is the ambience,
like the boom, boom.

2760
02:03:32,966 --> 02:03:35,400
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

2761
02:03:35,966 --> 02:03:36,433
Boom.

2762
02:03:37,433 --> 02:03:39,600
Oh, my God.

2763
02:03:40,616 --> 02:03:42,116
Where are we going?

2764
02:03:42,116 --> 02:03:43,383
I wish I was talking my friends around.

2765
02:03:43,383 --> 02:03:45,666
My favourite guy, you know, Slender Man.

2766
02:03:47,733 --> 02:03:49,883
Would you fuck Slenderman?

2767
02:03:50,133 --> 02:03:51,183
Yes. Tentacles.

2768
02:03:51,183 --> 02:03:52,800
What is that kind of question?

2769
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,716
I mean, he has. He has, he has.

2770
02:03:54,716 --> 02:03:55,550
He does have tentacles.

2771
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,383
I know that's.
That's a pretty Bay State to be honest.

2772
02:03:57,383 --> 02:03:59,316
Yeah, he has multiple angles.

2773
02:03:59,316 --> 02:04:00,333
Oh, can we just jump over?

2774
02:04:01,766 --> 02:04:03,366
All we know, there's a gate here.

2775
02:04:03,366 --> 02:04:05,633
There was an entrance, right?

2776
02:04:05,666 --> 02:04:07,966
I thought I figured something
revolutionary.

2777
02:04:07,983 --> 02:04:09,683
This where we came from.

2778
02:04:09,683 --> 02:04:11,850
Yeah. This is he from. Oh, yeah.

2779
02:04:12,333 --> 02:04:13,383
We went around in circles.

2780
02:04:13,383 --> 02:04:14,033
Oops.

2781
02:04:16,716 --> 02:04:17,733
Jesus.

2782
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:18,966
Oops.

2783
02:04:18,966 --> 02:04:21,116
Well, hey,

2784
02:04:22,566 --> 02:04:24,083
you know, I thought I was on to something.

2785
02:04:24,083 --> 02:04:25,200
OK, come on, Isaiah.

2786
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,300
Did we go here? Maybe down here.

2787
02:04:28,116 --> 02:04:29,133
There's another.

2788
02:04:29,133 --> 02:04:30,300
20. Anything.

2789
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,250
This flashlight is kind of garbled.

2790
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:34,133
Oh, yeah. OK, there's a bonfire.

2791
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:35,066
Oh, the lantern.

2792
02:04:35,066 --> 02:04:38,100
Oh, I love this.

2793
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,250
But I wish I would have been here

2794
02:04:40,266 --> 02:04:41,783
involuntary.

2795
02:04:43,616 --> 02:04:48,116
Oh, hell,
I computer does not like this dog.

2796
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:51,233
I know, I know.

2797
02:04:51,233 --> 02:04:53,366
I'm flying around the campfire.

2798
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:55,266
And senior campfire song.

2799
02:04:55,266 --> 02:04:58,650
Oh, see, I'm sorry. A song.

2800
02:04:58,833 --> 02:05:03,516
Oh, now, I was known
for how much it turned from SpongeBob.

2801
02:05:04,266 --> 02:05:06,450
I could just. Oh. Man.

2802
02:05:08,333 --> 02:05:09,333
Whoo ho.

2803
02:05:09,333 --> 02:05:10,516
Follow the ball.

2804
02:05:10,533 --> 02:05:11,666
For the bonfires.

2805
02:05:11,666 --> 02:05:13,416
All there's more. All your right.

2806
02:05:13,416 --> 02:05:14,033
There are more.

2807
02:05:14,033 --> 02:05:16,683
The whole of all
of all of all of the voting bonfire

2808
02:05:19,766 --> 02:05:20,333
there.

2809
02:05:20,433 --> 02:05:22,050
Well, this one's a. Lot more earthy.

2810
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:23,966
Oh, no. It's this exact same because.

2811
02:05:23,966 --> 02:05:27,683
Because because
because one of our friends.

2812
02:05:28,316 --> 02:05:32,100
I just know, like, if there's a monster,
we have to stand by this.

2813
02:05:32,466 --> 02:05:35,400
Folks, just. Like our studio.

2814
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:39,083
We're off to see the wizard
the wonderful Wizard of Oz.

2815
02:05:40,116 --> 02:05:41,783
That did not work.

2816
02:05:42,683 --> 02:05:44,516
I ain't seen no bonfires.

2817
02:05:44,516 --> 02:05:46,283
I hear an owl.

2818
02:05:46,283 --> 02:05:48,933
I hear a owl. Owl.

2819
02:05:53,033 --> 02:05:53,883
Friends

2820
02:05:57,633 --> 02:05:58,416
friends.

2821
02:06:00,966 --> 02:06:03,366
Although they are now lost for a second.

2822
02:06:04,566 --> 02:06:06,566
No, leave that for good luck.

2823
02:06:08,666 --> 02:06:09,533
What is that?

2824
02:06:09,533 --> 02:06:10,500
Fire.

2825
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,416
I was at the monster.

2826
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:13,933
All that's the monster. You

2827
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:16,283
made was based off.

2828
02:06:16,283 --> 02:06:18,333
This is not the first play.

2829
02:06:18,333 --> 02:06:19,766
This might be the first one.

2830
02:06:19,766 --> 02:06:23,966
I'm oh, my God. Oh.

2831
02:06:25,316 --> 02:06:27,650
I think I heard the

2832
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:29,816
creature come by.

2833
02:06:29,816 --> 02:06:30,866
I think I heard something, too.

2834
02:06:30,866 --> 02:06:33,266
But then I thought that was box.

2835
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:36,000
Well, what was that noise? Oh.

2836
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,250
An abandoned house.

2837
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:40,466
This town is indoors.

2838
02:06:41,216 --> 02:06:42,666
I think it does count as indoors. Yeah.

2839
02:06:42,666 --> 02:06:44,783
So we could probably go inside here
and stay away from.

2840
02:06:44,783 --> 02:06:45,750
Going to the attic.

2841
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,683
It says. A man. Attic.

2842
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,483
This guy looks like some science
some sort of writer.

2843
02:06:52,266 --> 02:06:53,616
Keep. OK.

2844
02:06:53,616 --> 02:06:56,033
All this is a lie.

2845
02:06:56,033 --> 02:06:57,450
You know what I look like?

2846
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:58,766
All these guys having sex.

2847
02:06:58,766 --> 02:07:00,083
He doesn't

2848
02:07:01,016 --> 02:07:02,883
this is like your father.

2849
02:07:02,883 --> 02:07:04,866
Father? Oh.

2850
02:07:06,566 --> 02:07:07,566
Is that a foetus?

2851
02:07:07,566 --> 02:07:08,550
What is your father's name?

2852
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:10,466
Is it Spike Island?

2853
02:07:10,466 --> 02:07:13,650
No. This is, I believe, Popeye.

2854
02:07:13,683 --> 02:07:14,033
Yeah.

2855
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,966
Pike's like.

2856
02:07:15,966 --> 02:07:18,383
Popeye. Popeye. That's cute.

2857
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,333
Sure, son.

2858
02:07:22,583 --> 02:07:24,683
I can check inside the drawers

2859
02:07:29,483 --> 02:07:30,533
again.

2860
02:07:31,166 --> 02:07:32,633
I turn that shit off.

2861
02:07:32,633 --> 02:07:33,600
I'm not.

2862
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:36,000
Yes. Turn around. Oh, my God.

2863
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,683
The British guys turned down.

2864
02:07:37,683 --> 02:07:38,283
It's a rave.

2865
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:41,083
It's a rave. Job.

2866
02:07:42,183 --> 02:07:44,883
For the people in the 1900s have raves.

2867
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:48,483
There's a locked. Door
and they're very important.

2868
02:07:48,666 --> 02:07:50,816
To me. But I'm bad at it.

2869
02:07:51,633 --> 02:07:54,033
Every time it rains it rained as.

2870
02:07:54,033 --> 02:07:56,316
I vox. Surely. Good.

2871
02:07:56,483 --> 02:07:58,883
Yeah, I thought that was the actual radio.

2872
02:07:58,883 --> 02:08:01,350
I think. I think we were laughing.

2873
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,816
Oh, that rain fell from heaven.

2874
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:06,600
She'll be Irving.

2875
02:08:07,016 --> 02:08:09,483
She'll be Doobie.

2876
02:08:12,216 --> 02:08:13,850
A doctor that's on fire.

2877
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:15,666
That's not funny Box.

2878
02:08:15,983 --> 02:08:16,383
Nothing.

2879
02:08:16,383 --> 02:08:18,716
And what happened was not box.

2880
02:08:18,733 --> 02:08:20,816
Something done no, no, wait. I was.

2881
02:08:21,083 --> 02:08:22,950
Singing. Oh.

2882
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:25,600
Oh, that was a monster. OK.

2883
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,250
I don't think.

2884
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,133
No, I already opened everything in there.

2885
02:08:28,133 --> 02:08:29,066
Eat something.

2886
02:08:29,066 --> 02:08:31,783
We need to go outside. I don't get this.

2887
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,633
God, I love the cake.

2888
02:08:33,633 --> 02:08:36,383
That was not any of us, that's for sure.

2889
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:37,883
Sorry. I think I forgot.

2890
02:08:37,883 --> 02:08:38,666
I forgot a key.

2891
02:08:38,666 --> 02:08:41,933
Oh. No way. The one Jordan, Shaq.

2892
02:08:43,383 --> 02:08:44,700
Ozaki.

2893
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:48,183
You just picked it up already.

2894
02:08:48,183 --> 02:08:49,383
I picked it up.

2895
02:08:49,933 --> 02:08:52,883
OK. Let's try it on one of the doors. Hmm.

2896
02:08:54,933 --> 02:08:56,133
Another door over there.

2897
02:08:56,133 --> 02:08:59,516
I might be the one for the upstairs.

2898
02:08:59,916 --> 02:09:00,216
Yeah.

2899
02:09:00,216 --> 02:09:02,850
Get him open this one.

2900
02:09:03,516 --> 02:09:04,800
Maybe the one upstairs.

2901
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,183
Yeah, the one up here.

2902
02:09:06,183 --> 02:09:06,783
It's like we're playing.

2903
02:09:06,783 --> 02:09:10,200
I'll kill me if I open the door. Yeah.

2904
02:09:10,266 --> 02:09:12,000
It's like I only.

2905
02:09:12,383 --> 02:09:15,083
We we we we. Wee.

2906
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:18,116
There's a lot of bearded man

2907
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,683
yeah.

2908
02:09:19,683 --> 02:09:22,383
I'm washing me in my clothes.

2909
02:09:22,566 --> 02:09:25,166
What I.

2910
02:09:25,166 --> 02:09:27,216
There's a y. There's a bed.

2911
02:09:27,216 --> 02:09:28,133
And there's a bed.

2912
02:09:28,133 --> 02:09:30,116
I'm I'm just being an idiot.

2913
02:09:31,433 --> 02:09:34,466
Oh, got a bed.

2914
02:09:34,466 --> 02:09:35,816
I found a key, though.

2915
02:09:35,816 --> 02:09:38,966
You're very, like,
I don't know, enamoured by the bed.

2916
02:09:38,966 --> 02:09:40,800
It was. That sounds amazing.

2917
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,633
I want to see one of those gifts,
which is that

2918
02:09:42,633 --> 02:09:44,783
which is it
just says bed jump scare. And it has.

2919
02:09:44,783 --> 02:09:48,416
I just kind of walking around
that a bed appears and it goes back.

2920
02:09:48,666 --> 02:09:49,483
So my God.

2921
02:09:53,250 --> 02:09:55,800
It's a very
crunchy bed, if you like, walk around it.

2922
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:56,333
It sounds like you're.

2923
02:09:56,333 --> 02:09:59,616
Cleaning the grass. Sound effects. Yeah.

2924
02:09:59,616 --> 02:10:00,966
That's funny.

2925
02:10:00,966 --> 02:10:03,900
Why the hell is bathroom?

2926
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:05,283
Kind of nasty?

2927
02:10:05,283 --> 02:10:06,600
You know, just

2928
02:10:07,883 --> 02:10:08,983
I I think this is just.

2929
02:10:08,983 --> 02:10:12,183
Basically hearing somebody breathing
like, oh.

2930
02:10:12,183 --> 02:10:14,366
No one.
No one should be coming inside this house.

2931
02:10:14,366 --> 02:10:15,450
I doubt it.

2932
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:17,583
No, I think. Don't you have a key? Like.

2933
02:10:17,583 --> 02:10:18,233
Yeah, I do.

2934
02:10:18,233 --> 02:10:21,066
I think it's for the one downstairs. Wait.

2935
02:10:21,333 --> 02:10:21,866
Who turned out?

2936
02:10:21,866 --> 02:10:24,116
No, no, it would have been from the one up
here, right?

2937
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:25,383
Who turned that turned on.

2938
02:10:25,383 --> 02:10:27,483
That was on. The first floor. Oh.

2939
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,483
One second. Close.

2940
02:10:29,483 --> 02:10:31,583
The door is shut.

2941
02:10:31,583 --> 02:10:33,083
Shut, close.

2942
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:34,016
Locked.

2943
02:10:34,016 --> 02:10:37,133
OK, this place is haunted.

2944
02:10:37,133 --> 02:10:38,666
Yeah. The surprise, the fucking nobody.

2945
02:10:38,666 --> 02:10:41,750
It's a horror game. Damn, son, speed up.

2946
02:10:41,766 --> 02:10:44,166
I mean, they. Run into a fucking

2947
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,833
running block

2948
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:48,300
in Samarra
from the ring in the forest. Man.

2949
02:10:49,766 --> 02:10:51,833
Where's is other door so bad?

2950
02:10:51,833 --> 02:10:52,850
This door.

2951
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:53,933
That's the one.

2952
02:10:54,150 --> 02:10:56,100
Nice. You know.

2953
02:10:56,483 --> 02:10:57,566
Which one is it?

2954
02:10:57,566 --> 02:11:00,933
Oh, there's, like, spices
and and like, tinctures in there.

2955
02:11:01,883 --> 02:11:03,066
Oh, it's another locked door.

2956
02:11:03,066 --> 02:11:05,033
Wow. Amazing.

2957
02:11:05,316 --> 02:11:07,266
I found a key. Oh, you found it.

2958
02:11:07,266 --> 02:11:08,916
Oh, I'm happy for the store.

2959
02:11:08,916 --> 02:11:09,866
For this store.

2960
02:11:12,066 --> 02:11:13,083
Oh, no.

2961
02:11:13,083 --> 02:11:14,550
It must be for something else.

2962
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:17,133
Really. The other door
that was locked on the first floor.

2963
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:17,733
We're going to.

2964
02:11:17,733 --> 02:11:21,150
We're going to go back upstairs
or maybe this one back here.

2965
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,766
I'm just going to say.

2966
02:11:22,766 --> 02:11:25,916
Ah, I think I heard something outside
the house.

2967
02:11:25,916 --> 02:11:28,200
I'm pretty sure it's, like.
Stuck in the box.

2968
02:11:28,883 --> 02:11:30,783
Yeah. Was that you?

2969
02:11:30,783 --> 02:11:31,850
Oh, yeah. I'm still upstairs.

2970
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:33,933
The sound is confusing me.
I thought you guys were up.

2971
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:36,683
Did you just hear that super loud noise?

2972
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:38,783
Yeah, I saw someone else is. Yeah.

2973
02:11:38,783 --> 02:11:40,616
Something's outside the house right now.

2974
02:11:40,616 --> 02:11:42,300
Yeah, that was loud as heck.

2975
02:11:43,433 --> 02:11:44,166
I think it can't.

2976
02:11:44,166 --> 02:11:45,983
It can't come inside.

2977
02:11:45,983 --> 02:11:49,100
So did you try it on the door
down downstairs?

2978
02:11:49,416 --> 02:11:52,416
Like the house is like
the house is like a condom.

2979
02:11:52,416 --> 02:11:54,800
It can't really come inside, so.

2980
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:58,683
Or any in the room. Oh.

2981
02:11:59,833 --> 02:12:01,416
These guys.

2982
02:12:01,416 --> 02:12:02,133
The boys.

2983
02:12:02,133 --> 02:12:04,200
Oh, this. One's a white new.

2984
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,216
New room. Oh.

2985
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:09,083
In here.

2986
02:12:09,083 --> 02:12:09,866
This room.

2987
02:12:10,583 --> 02:12:12,666
For a second,
I thought that because of the way.

2988
02:12:12,683 --> 02:12:13,233
The drawers.

2989
02:12:13,233 --> 02:12:16,916
Lock and the drawers, the phones,
it looked like he was bold.

2990
02:12:16,916 --> 02:12:18,033
And I thought that they were just

2991
02:12:18,033 --> 02:12:20,250
images in this house was just him
gradually losing his hair.

2992
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:22,083
Oh, my God.

2993
02:12:22,083 --> 02:12:24,783
Oh, he's. Pissed. Already. Use
the key was was.

2994
02:12:24,783 --> 02:12:28,233
This was the room that I found was a key
that I found at this room.

2995
02:12:28,883 --> 02:12:31,083
There's other locked doors over here.

2996
02:12:31,083 --> 02:12:33,716
I tried already,
and none of the doors open.

2997
02:12:34,133 --> 02:12:36,183
The ghost really wants us, by the way.

2998
02:12:36,183 --> 02:12:38,033
Holy shit. All

2999
02:12:39,233 --> 02:12:40,416
right, fuck off.

3000
02:12:40,416 --> 02:12:42,600
Boom, boom.

3001
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:43,383
Boom.

3002
02:12:44,766 --> 02:12:46,583
The doors just keep closing abruptly.

3003
02:12:46,583 --> 02:12:47,216
In front of us.

3004
02:12:47,216 --> 02:12:49,766
No, I think we already in this.

3005
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:52,450
I see your dumb arse outside.

3006
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:54,833
Use my key to someone to.

3007
02:12:55,316 --> 02:12:57,083
See your dumb arse walking around.

3008
02:12:57,083 --> 02:13:00,183
Only the person who picked it up
can use it.

3009
02:13:00,183 --> 02:13:03,050
Now, do you open the new

3010
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:04,316
boom?

3011
02:13:04,316 --> 02:13:05,883
You open the new.

3012
02:13:06,066 --> 02:13:06,966
Room.

3013
02:13:08,783 --> 02:13:11,016
Where is this DMCA music?

3014
02:13:11,016 --> 02:13:12,300
I hope it's on.

3015
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:13,533
No, I doubt it.

3016
02:13:13,533 --> 02:13:14,766
OK, now it's super old.

3017
02:13:14,766 --> 02:13:17,283
We should be good. OK, cool.

3018
02:13:18,033 --> 02:13:20,566
You have to

3019
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:23,383
a bit.

3020
02:13:23,383 --> 02:13:23,966
Yeah.

3021
02:13:25,383 --> 02:13:27,216
Would you do this thing?

3022
02:13:27,216 --> 02:13:30,116
Yeah, at the birthday.

3023
02:13:30,483 --> 02:13:34,433
Mr President,

3024
02:13:35,033 --> 02:13:38,783
happy birthday to you.

3025
02:13:42,516 --> 02:13:43,150
I swear to you,

3026
02:13:43,150 --> 02:13:46,400
I think you guys use my key.

3027
02:13:47,733 --> 02:13:49,050
Don't even see my inventory.

3028
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:49,983
I think you can.

3029
02:13:49,983 --> 02:13:52,716
Hello. Luckily, Tora Korea. Tora!

3030
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:54,483
Tora!

3031
02:13:54,483 --> 02:13:55,616
You're out there.

3032
02:13:56,450 --> 02:14:01,383
Oh. They may suppress it in.

3033
02:14:01,733 --> 02:14:04,616
Oh, I think I see him.

3034
02:14:05,216 --> 02:14:06,816
Oh. Sorry.

3035
02:14:06,816 --> 02:14:09,083
I was yawning. I'm sorry.

3036
02:14:10,016 --> 02:14:11,033
Sorry. Sorry.

3037
02:14:11,033 --> 02:14:14,033
I'm very, very woozy at the moment.

3038
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,033
The alcohol's getting so big.

3039
02:14:17,033 --> 02:14:18,300
I found a key.

3040
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:20,733
Nice. OK, I'll close the door.
I think I'll feel now.

3041
02:14:20,766 --> 02:14:22,116
I can't even close the door.

3042
02:14:22,116 --> 02:14:24,033
I'll close the door. I tried.

3043
02:14:24,033 --> 02:14:26,250
You cannot close the door.

3044
02:14:26,616 --> 02:14:28,116
I got you upstairs.

3045
02:14:28,116 --> 02:14:29,916
Yeah. Oh,

3046
02:14:30,633 --> 02:14:32,700
which did you find where?

3047
02:14:32,783 --> 02:14:34,583
I found some sort of key.

3048
02:14:34,583 --> 02:14:38,433
I'm going to try it on the door again.

3049
02:14:38,433 --> 02:14:40,416
Dude. It keeps getting me.

3050
02:14:40,416 --> 02:14:43,116
Yeah. It works. Nice.

3051
02:14:43,116 --> 02:14:44,466
You guys heard that, right?

3052
02:14:44,466 --> 02:14:45,600
Yeah.

3053
02:14:45,966 --> 02:14:48,533
He's not a happy boy.

3054
02:14:48,533 --> 02:14:50,100
Oh, there it is.

3055
02:14:50,516 --> 02:14:51,916
Nice. OK.

3056
02:14:51,916 --> 02:14:54,066
OK, now we're just knocking, right?

3057
02:14:54,066 --> 02:14:54,683
There we go.

3058
02:14:56,483 --> 02:14:57,666
That's not Vox.

3059
02:14:57,666 --> 02:14:58,983
It's just the game, right?

3060
02:14:58,983 --> 02:15:00,133
The ghost. Or.

3061
02:15:00,133 --> 02:15:01,433
Yeah, ok.

3062
02:15:02,733 --> 02:15:04,116
OK. It's none of these doors.

3063
02:15:04,116 --> 02:15:06,450
So it has to be one of them downstairs.

3064
02:15:06,450 --> 02:15:07,566
I think it's the one on the first floor.

3065
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:09,983
Yeah, that's the connecting door.

3066
02:15:10,016 --> 02:15:11,783
This one was really loud last time.

3067
02:15:11,783 --> 02:15:15,083
Yeah, this is the one. OK.

3068
02:15:16,016 --> 02:15:17,316
Oh, that's nasty.

3069
02:15:17,316 --> 02:15:19,616
That's kind of gross. OK,
but there's a key inside his mouth.

3070
02:15:19,683 --> 02:15:22,200
Oh, I use my key on this one.
He's like a. Wing.

3071
02:15:22,383 --> 02:15:24,866
He's like an when I got a key when

3072
02:15:26,666 --> 02:15:29,033
ok, I got a key.

3073
02:15:29,033 --> 02:15:29,483
I also.

3074
02:15:29,483 --> 02:15:32,700
I open the door, roll this door.

3075
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:34,766
I open it with my key. Oh.

3076
02:15:36,683 --> 02:15:38,216
You cannot see shit in this.

3077
02:15:38,216 --> 02:15:38,933
Where am. I?

3078
02:15:38,933 --> 02:15:41,250
You know, each cloud contains, man.

3079
02:15:41,250 --> 02:15:44,783
There's room there, and she made me do

3080
02:15:48,183 --> 02:15:48,766
I think.

3081
02:15:48,766 --> 02:15:50,133
No, I just open.

3082
02:15:50,133 --> 02:15:52,416
If we have another. Key here
before I just.

3083
02:15:52,416 --> 02:15:53,733
Open the door.

3084
02:15:53,733 --> 02:15:56,133
It's connecting the kitchen to the side.

3085
02:15:56,133 --> 02:15:57,266
That's the thing.

3086
02:15:57,266 --> 02:16:01,133
I think there might be a
the key is probably for upstairs.

3087
02:16:02,083 --> 02:16:03,566
You're going to go back upstairs.

3088
02:16:03,566 --> 02:16:07,100
Upstairs to this house
has us going running around left

3089
02:16:07,116 --> 02:16:10,466
and right on the open the door. Yes.

3090
02:16:11,666 --> 02:16:15,216
Up, up, up, up, up.

3091
02:16:15,216 --> 02:16:17,366
Zap is using my collar.

3092
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,133
Show you using my collar.

3093
02:16:19,133 --> 02:16:20,400
I said, why am I putting.

3094
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:23,100
There's only three colours for all.

3095
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,050
You guys heard that, right?

3096
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:27,583
Yeah, I heard that.

3097
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,533
It's locked.

3098
02:16:30,366 --> 02:16:30,900
Yeah.

3099
02:16:31,566 --> 02:16:32,216
Yeah.

3100
02:16:32,316 --> 02:16:32,716
That was.

3101
02:16:32,716 --> 02:16:35,683
What I. Thought. A key

3102
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:37,783
for this one.

3103
02:16:38,916 --> 02:16:42,450
I I'm on my way home eventually.

3104
02:16:42,716 --> 02:16:44,816
Get out of this house.

3105
02:16:45,683 --> 02:16:46,783
Come for this.

3106
02:16:48,266 --> 02:16:49,683
Oh, shall we end it right now?

3107
02:16:49,683 --> 02:16:51,533
All right, guys, I got it.

3108
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:53,633
All right. You're already in it.

3109
02:16:54,266 --> 02:16:56,516
I feel like a different icon,
like the unlock.

3110
02:16:56,516 --> 02:16:59,233
I was like, oh, I did it.

3111
02:16:59,233 --> 02:17:01,166
The store's open, too.

3112
02:17:01,166 --> 02:17:03,516
I did all the time.

3113
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:07,200
Never mind all these doors
just, like, lead to this area. OK.

3114
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:09,183
There's nothing in here. Dude.

3115
02:17:09,183 --> 02:17:11,283
Imagine we just like waiting.

3116
02:17:14,516 --> 02:17:16,433
Oh, the the books.

3117
02:17:16,433 --> 02:17:17,250
The books.

3118
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:19,650
It's a puzzle for the books.

3119
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:22,583
We need to go search
for the rest of the books in the house.

3120
02:17:22,883 --> 02:17:25,083
Yeah, like,
I just pulled out one of the books.

3121
02:17:25,083 --> 02:17:27,983
It must have unlocked something somewhere.

3122
02:17:27,983 --> 02:17:30,083
There might be another secret entrance.

3123
02:17:30,083 --> 02:17:32,116
Oh, up here. Up here. Attic. Attic.

3124
02:17:32,116 --> 02:17:36,983
Oh, door knob.

3125
02:17:36,983 --> 02:17:37,533
Oh, oh.

3126
02:17:37,533 --> 02:17:40,283
OK, now what's I was just say. Oh.

3127
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:43,566
Everybody. Oh, yeah, I saw that.

3128
02:17:43,566 --> 02:17:44,100
I saw that.

3129
02:17:46,716 --> 02:17:47,783
I will need three.

3130
02:17:47,783 --> 02:17:52,933
African effigies made from wood to create
the hex for the crypt door in the story.

3131
02:17:52,933 --> 02:17:53,700
These two get back in.

3132
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:55,800
Eventually,
these effigies should be hung up.

3133
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:58,950
Somewhere in the forest,
I crafted a ceremonial dagger

3134
02:17:58,950 --> 02:18:00,216
to go with the final ritual.

3135
02:18:00,216 --> 02:18:01,916
I can use this to break the seal.

3136
02:18:01,916 --> 02:18:03,933
OK, I've seen one of those things out
in the woods.

3137
02:18:03,933 --> 02:18:05,816
Yeah, we saw one. Yeah, me too.

3138
02:18:05,816 --> 02:18:07,316
Yeah, I just grabbed one.

3139
02:18:07,316 --> 02:18:08,700
I think that was just, like, up here.

3140
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:10,400
Right on.

3141
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:11,933
Let me see how touching my inventory.

3142
02:18:11,933 --> 02:18:13,266
Mm hmm.

3143
02:18:13,266 --> 02:18:16,100
Mm Da da da da dum.

3144
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:18,416
Oh, no, never mind that.
That was an effigy.

3145
02:18:18,416 --> 02:18:19,766
Do we have the axe?

3146
02:18:19,766 --> 02:18:22,416
Always. We're supposed to get the axe. Oh.

3147
02:18:22,416 --> 02:18:24,633
I guess we go out there and look for it.

3148
02:18:24,633 --> 02:18:24,983
Yeah.

3149
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:31,433
OK. There's all this. OK.

3150
02:18:32,183 --> 02:18:33,766
I was going to say,
if this house had us, like,

3151
02:18:33,766 --> 02:18:37,683
fucking around and running around for,
like, nothing, I've been, like, the worst.

3152
02:18:37,716 --> 02:18:40,033
Oh, my God. This is a crusty Ben.

3153
02:18:40,033 --> 02:18:42,600
Yeah, it sounds like crushed up leaves,

3154
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:43,433
like, you

3155
02:18:47,333 --> 02:18:49,800
all right, let's get out this house.

3156
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,116
We're done here.

3157
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:53,766
You're so green. Colour, bitch. Pink.

3158
02:18:53,766 --> 02:18:55,200
Wish this would shut up.

3159
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,000
But I have to use the green colour.

3160
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,433
FYI, in this right flick.

3161
02:18:59,433 --> 02:19:02,516
Whatever I ever brought all

3162
02:19:04,566 --> 02:19:04,866
ever.

3163
02:19:04,866 --> 02:19:06,750
Mom, you understand me?

3164
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:07,883
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3165
02:19:07,883 --> 02:19:10,500
It's not. Fake. God.

3166
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,716
How do we find our way back?

3167
02:19:12,933 --> 02:19:14,616
You put a lot of sticks.

3168
02:19:14,616 --> 02:19:16,616
I you were the only one that passed.
Yeah, you do.

3169
02:19:16,766 --> 02:19:18,750
I think we follow you

3170
02:19:22,383 --> 02:19:23,033
how are you?

3171
02:19:23,033 --> 02:19:25,500
Are you all right
to. The bonfire over. Here?

3172
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:28,066
Well, I.

3173
02:19:28,066 --> 02:19:30,966
It's my decision making so bad.

3174
02:19:30,966 --> 02:19:33,300
I you sure you're not drunk, too?

3175
02:19:34,166 --> 02:19:36,266
Is this where we started?

3176
02:19:36,266 --> 02:19:38,133
Mm. No.

3177
02:19:38,133 --> 02:19:39,333
Different one.

3178
02:19:40,283 --> 02:19:42,600
Put a lot of glow sticks
at the first part,

3179
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:44,750
and if you follow one of those, we'll
get to one of the

3180
02:19:49,233 --> 02:19:49,833
I think.

3181
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:52,916
I think the monster is gone.

3182
02:19:52,916 --> 02:19:54,483
No, no.

3183
02:19:54,483 --> 02:19:57,216
I heard something breathing upfront. Oh.

3184
02:19:57,966 --> 02:19:58,833
You guys hear that, right?

3185
02:19:58,833 --> 02:19:59,400
Yeah, I hear it.

3186
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:00,300
Yeah.

3187
02:20:02,733 --> 02:20:04,150
Because it's an effigy.

3188
02:20:04,150 --> 02:20:07,116
Oh, that was the effigy
that was making on the noises.

3189
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:08,783
Oh, you broke.

3190
02:20:08,783 --> 02:20:09,816
You broke it.

3191
02:20:10,916 --> 02:20:12,600
I think we need to run

3192
02:20:14,366 --> 02:20:14,633
that was.

3193
02:20:14,633 --> 02:20:15,900
You didn't.

3194
02:20:17,283 --> 02:20:19,766
Oh. Oh, my God.

3195
02:20:20,933 --> 02:20:22,916
Oh, the foot.

3196
02:20:22,916 --> 02:20:23,683
I love that.

3197
02:20:23,683 --> 02:20:26,100
It gets shot, though, every single time.

3198
02:20:29,316 --> 02:20:30,033
Everybody shut up.

3199
02:20:30,033 --> 02:20:30,600
I need to listen.

3200
02:20:41,133 --> 02:20:42,033
Penis.

3201
02:20:42,983 --> 02:20:44,883
Like I'm not talking, sweetie.

3202
02:20:44,883 --> 02:20:45,233
Sweating.

3203
02:20:45,383 --> 02:20:46,650
Shut the fuck up.

3204
02:20:51,516 --> 02:20:52,166
So here's.

3205
02:20:52,166 --> 02:20:52,650
That.

3206
02:20:54,066 --> 02:20:55,500
Glass. That was just grass.

3207
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:56,366
Oh, that's a no.

3208
02:20:56,366 --> 02:20:57,966
That's gas. Yeah.

3209
02:20:57,966 --> 02:20:59,583
Oh, my God.
We haven't gone outside in so long.

3210
02:20:59,583 --> 02:21:00,716
We can all recognisable.

3211
02:21:00,716 --> 02:21:03,216
I know. Oh, grass and so long.

3212
02:21:03,683 --> 02:21:05,850
Oh, guys. Morning.

3213
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:08,133
Oh. Oh, is it this entrance?

3214
02:21:09,633 --> 02:21:10,883
Yeah, it might be.

3215
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:12,483
Oh, we went back to the vacuole.

3216
02:21:12,483 --> 02:21:16,383
We actually went back to the entrance. How

3217
02:21:16,383 --> 02:21:17,466
what is that.

3218
02:21:17,733 --> 02:21:19,833
00 it's coming, it's coming.

3219
02:21:19,833 --> 02:21:22,916
Run to a bonfire, run inside
or to a bonfire a beast.

3220
02:21:23,666 --> 02:21:24,983
Follow me, follow me into the house.

3221
02:21:24,983 --> 02:21:26,183
We all get to the house.

3222
02:21:26,183 --> 02:21:28,216
Quickly
everyone to the confines of our houses.

3223
02:21:28,433 --> 02:21:32,766
Safe house what you do best, guys us
do what you do best.

3224
02:21:32,766 --> 02:21:33,633
Stay inside.

3225
02:21:34,683 --> 02:21:35,783
Dogs go.

3226
02:21:35,783 --> 02:21:36,266
Down.

3227
02:21:36,266 --> 02:21:36,900
I love that.

3228
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,683
Every time we go in here,
we get Resident Evil, save music.

3229
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:41,733
I mean. It's actually the safe.

3230
02:21:41,733 --> 02:21:43,350
It feels like the safe room music.

3231
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:44,550
It's very reminiscence.

3232
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,733
Here.

3233
02:21:44,733 --> 02:21:46,650
We can go back to the first one,
find that we didn't

3234
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:49,750
find the the effigy that we find
that was on Facebook.

3235
02:21:50,433 --> 02:21:51,383
Yeah,

3236
02:21:53,333 --> 02:21:54,300
but how did we get

3237
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:56,883
to the first bonfire from here?

3238
02:21:57,983 --> 02:22:00,566
You know, we just go to the right, like,
outside of the house.

3239
02:22:00,566 --> 02:22:03,450
I don't think we went from the backyard
to look from here.

3240
02:22:07,383 --> 02:22:08,283
Oh, we got run.

3241
02:22:08,283 --> 02:22:08,816
We got to run.

3242
02:22:08,816 --> 02:22:09,333
We got to run.

3243
02:22:09,333 --> 02:22:12,450
I get the fuck away.

3244
02:22:12,983 --> 02:22:14,450
I'm going back inside the house.

3245
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:15,550
To the house.

3246
02:22:15,716 --> 02:22:16,683
I'm going back in the house.

3247
02:22:16,683 --> 02:22:18,983
I got usually he was like, very.

3248
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:21,300
He's why we do not touch grass.

3249
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:23,016
He's right behind
you. He's right behind you.

3250
02:22:24,966 --> 02:22:26,033
Oh, no, no, no.

3251
02:22:26,033 --> 02:22:26,483
Close the. Door.

3252
02:22:26,483 --> 02:22:28,883
Close the door. Closed your fucking forest
spirit.

3253
02:22:28,883 --> 02:22:30,416
Dude, you're kind of cool.

3254
02:22:30,416 --> 02:22:31,016
I can save him.

3255
02:22:31,016 --> 02:22:33,000
I can see. I still alive.

3256
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,916
I got you. I got you.

3257
02:22:35,016 --> 02:22:36,900
Oh. No.

3258
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,033
Why are you closing the door?

3259
02:22:38,033 --> 02:22:40,333
You fucking all like.

3260
02:22:40,466 --> 02:22:43,466
For us e to revive.

3261
02:22:43,466 --> 02:22:45,866
Like me.

3262
02:22:46,916 --> 02:22:48,516
Part of me thought that there wasn't

3263
02:22:48,516 --> 02:22:51,566
going to be an enemy on this map
because we didn't see anybody for so long.

3264
02:22:52,316 --> 02:22:55,283
I guess it just waited for us
to get to the attic.

3265
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:56,633
This one.

3266
02:22:57,300 --> 02:22:59,183
Oh, my God.

3267
02:22:59,183 --> 02:23:00,400
The bonfire is outside.

3268
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:01,800
We went to the right.

3269
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,783
We're going hunting down by forest.

3270
02:23:03,783 --> 02:23:06,750
Spirit and type for spirit group.

3271
02:23:08,066 --> 02:23:08,916
I'm pretty

3272
02:23:09,983 --> 02:23:11,916
it's go time.

3273
02:23:12,383 --> 02:23:14,783
I mean.

3274
02:23:14,933 --> 02:23:15,833
We're here.

3275
02:23:15,833 --> 02:23:18,216
We're we.

3276
02:23:18,850 --> 02:23:19,216
In the.

3277
02:23:20,733 --> 02:23:21,750
Fruit.

3278
02:23:21,833 --> 02:23:23,883
I don't
even remember where the first bonfire is.

3279
02:23:24,083 --> 02:23:25,750
Oh, yeah?

3280
02:23:26,783 --> 02:23:29,033
You guys are making me yawn, you know?

3281
02:23:30,133 --> 02:23:32,766
And this. There's the first one fight.

3282
02:23:32,766 --> 02:23:34,166
Well, there's something.

3283
02:23:34,166 --> 02:23:37,283
Oh, ha ha. Ha.

3284
02:23:37,283 --> 02:23:38,633
OK, the one fight.

3285
02:23:38,633 --> 02:23:39,783
We're safe here, right?

3286
02:23:39,783 --> 02:23:41,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3287
02:23:41,216 --> 02:23:43,583
It was so I. Can't see him.

3288
02:23:44,183 --> 02:23:45,300
I cannot see him. Either.

3289
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:46,616
I can just hear

3290
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:48,233
you walking.

3291
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:52,050
I want to leave my glow sticks right here.

3292
02:23:53,766 --> 02:23:54,483
I know that.

3293
02:23:54,483 --> 02:23:58,866
Next month I think we lost.

3294
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:02,133
I think we are lost. Is Brussels.

3295
02:24:02,166 --> 02:24:06,633
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

3296
02:24:07,233 --> 02:24:08,533
Oh, I'm

3297
02:24:10,116 --> 02:24:10,500
following you.

3298
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,316
Like the look on

3299
02:24:12,316 --> 02:24:16,500
Soto's face, like his character
model looks so tired and horrified.

3300
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:17,333
And he sat there going.

3301
02:24:17,333 --> 02:24:19,566
Oh, I'm just. Stretching.

3302
02:24:19,566 --> 02:24:20,633
I'm just stretching.

3303
02:24:20,633 --> 02:24:24,083
Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, bro.

3304
02:24:25,583 --> 02:24:27,000
And talking, like, an Indy girl idea.

3305
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,566
What do you really think? Yeah,
I feel like, oh, one way.

3306
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,866
I think that's a mistake.

3307
02:24:35,733 --> 02:24:37,833
He's a he's over there.

3308
02:24:37,833 --> 02:24:39,383
If you would just like to go over.

3309
02:24:39,383 --> 02:24:40,266
We just got to be better.

3310
02:24:40,266 --> 02:24:41,466
Watch this.

3311
02:24:42,933 --> 02:24:44,016
We're going to die.

3312
02:24:45,233 --> 02:24:49,916
No. Aren't you going back to the house?

3313
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:51,816
Is this back to the house?

3314
02:24:51,816 --> 02:24:53,366
No, no, no. This is someplace different.

3315
02:24:53,366 --> 02:24:55,466
You know, this is a different area.

3316
02:24:55,466 --> 02:24:57,233
ALL Let's go this way.

3317
02:24:57,233 --> 02:24:59,100
Is this back to the house?

3318
02:25:00,716 --> 02:25:01,366
Oh, I see.

3319
02:25:01,366 --> 02:25:02,216
Ghost like.

3320
02:25:02,216 --> 02:25:04,683
I know. Every.

3321
02:25:05,283 --> 02:25:07,150
This. Oh, this is the aisle.

3322
02:25:07,150 --> 02:25:09,416
This is the other house. OK, so left.

3323
02:25:09,933 --> 02:25:12,833
OK, so what if we just continue down
this path?

3324
02:25:12,833 --> 02:25:13,983
Like we didn't go down here.

3325
02:25:13,983 --> 02:25:16,500
A bonfire. A bonfire? Oh.

3326
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:18,516
Yeah. I'll put some
glow sticks down, too. Oh,

3327
02:25:21,566 --> 02:25:23,666
ok. I know how to use those.

3328
02:25:23,666 --> 02:25:24,900
The exam palace.

3329
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:25,233
Yeah.

3330
02:25:25,233 --> 02:25:27,533
Now, do we are we here in effigy?
Anywhere?

3331
02:25:28,466 --> 02:25:30,966
I found one over here last time.

3332
02:25:30,966 --> 02:25:32,583
OK, all right.

3333
02:25:32,733 --> 02:25:33,783
Drop some sticks.

3334
02:25:33,783 --> 02:25:36,300
I'm on the way to the Sistine Chapel.

3335
02:25:36,366 --> 02:25:38,483
Effigy. Effigy? Yes.

3336
02:25:38,483 --> 02:25:43,016
All Parker's been pondering that one,
which is find the one more that we saw.

3337
02:25:43,233 --> 02:25:45,516
I mean, one more,
and then we're done. On the ground.

3338
02:25:45,516 --> 02:25:48,033
Yeah. Yeah, it.
Was the first one that we saw.

3339
02:25:48,066 --> 02:25:50,466
We found the other ones,
but we haven't seen the first one.

3340
02:25:50,816 --> 02:25:51,666
The first one.

3341
02:25:51,666 --> 02:25:53,700
Was it, like, near the house, maybe? Or.

3342
02:25:54,483 --> 02:25:58,250
OK, so when we found the first bonfire,
then we went to a second one

3343
02:25:58,383 --> 02:26:02,616
and from there, I dropped down glow sticks
on the entire way when I found it,

3344
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:05,850
but I haven't been able
to, like, rediscover them.

3345
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:09,266
All right, let's if we can go back
to, like, the big house,

3346
02:26:09,266 --> 02:26:09,750
you know, the one

3347
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:12,416
we were finding all of the shit
that I reckon that will help us find

3348
02:26:12,966 --> 02:26:15,300
the other bonfires. The house.

3349
02:26:18,350 --> 02:26:19,983
That the original

3350
02:26:19,983 --> 02:26:23,400
our original haunted house
that we were gone through.

3351
02:26:24,066 --> 02:26:24,483
The house.

3352
02:26:24,483 --> 02:26:25,883
Where we found all the shit and the what.

3353
02:26:25,883 --> 02:26:27,266
Is this place

3354
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:31,766
oh, is this a mausoleum or graveyard?

3355
02:26:32,166 --> 02:26:33,150
Yeah, this is a graveyard.

3356
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:34,750
Graveyard mausoleum.

3357
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,683
These not.

3358
02:26:36,083 --> 02:26:40,166
OK. Oh, what the fuck is this
one thinking?

3359
02:26:40,283 --> 02:26:42,150
The gates of hell.

3360
02:26:42,150 --> 02:26:44,016
Oh, maybe this is where we got to go.

3361
02:26:44,016 --> 02:26:46,133
The man, the myth, the legend.

3362
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:47,866
This smoke.

3363
02:26:48,516 --> 02:26:50,316
That's Glowsticks.

3364
02:26:51,300 --> 02:26:51,833
Gone. It.

3365
02:26:51,833 --> 02:26:54,483
The flashlight is not doing me
any favours.

3366
02:26:55,983 --> 02:26:57,266
Lonnie ls.

3367
02:26:57,266 --> 02:27:00,300
Mm hmm. Okay,

3368
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:02,066
here lies Baden together.

3369
02:27:02,066 --> 02:27:04,283
Why the fuck does that mean?

3370
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:05,366
Zeke again?

3371
02:27:05,366 --> 02:27:08,733
Something about the difference
I can't tighten.

3372
02:27:08,766 --> 02:27:09,583
Oh, my God.

3373
02:27:09,583 --> 02:27:11,616
Oh, stop.

3374
02:27:13,883 --> 02:27:16,033
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

3375
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,350
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

3376
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:21,150
I thought all I was removed.

3377
02:27:22,433 --> 02:27:23,066
Know that was me.

3378
02:27:23,066 --> 02:27:24,833
Sorry. So instead.

3379
02:27:24,833 --> 02:27:27,450
Of. Oh, my apologies to both of you, then.

3380
02:27:27,683 --> 02:27:28,833
Oh, my goodness.

3381
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:31,350
Why not? Let's not talk about it.
Let's not.

3382
02:27:31,350 --> 02:27:32,166
I thought.

3383
02:27:32,166 --> 02:27:34,016
OK, ok. Not not. Don't look at me.

3384
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:34,866
Look at me.

3385
02:27:37,366 --> 02:27:38,583
Leg here.

3386
02:27:38,583 --> 02:27:39,050
Let's go.

3387
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:41,666
I know. I'll come back.

3388
02:27:41,666 --> 02:27:43,650
I'm sorry.

3389
02:27:50,066 --> 02:27:52,916
OK? This should be close by right.

3390
02:27:53,183 --> 02:27:53,800
Around this area.

3391
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:56,333
I think we just got more far away. Really?

3392
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:59,616
And if anybody can see anything,
because I sure as heck can.

3393
02:27:59,783 --> 02:28:00,633
I'm blind.

3394
02:28:00,633 --> 02:28:01,350
Free now.

3395
02:28:05,366 --> 02:28:07,066
Do it my way.

3396
02:28:07,066 --> 02:28:09,133
I mean, it's health centre.

3397
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:12,966
Someone's to the right I.

3398
02:28:12,966 --> 02:28:13,650
All right.

3399
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:14,316
Sounds like a sound.

3400
02:28:14,316 --> 02:28:16,700
I hear the sounds of off

3401
02:28:17,166 --> 02:28:19,800
is the purple on you.

3402
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,750
Where did

3403
02:28:29,783 --> 02:28:31,316
It was nice knowing you all.

3404
02:28:31,316 --> 02:28:32,100
Coming after. Us.

3405
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:34,133
Well well, tonight it's been.

3406
02:28:34,133 --> 02:28:36,566
It's been an honour.
It's been an honour serving.

3407
02:28:39,566 --> 02:28:41,200
Goodbye for you

3408
02:28:41,733 --> 02:28:42,983
I bucks

3409
02:28:46,133 --> 02:28:47,616
follow the classics to.

3410
02:28:47,616 --> 02:28:50,783
Follow the classics. Get the fuck out.

3411
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,433
Oh, bonfire, bonfire, bonfire, bonfire.

3412
02:28:53,616 --> 02:28:55,916
We ha.

3413
02:28:55,916 --> 02:28:57,966
This is our Siebert circle fucker.

3414
02:28:57,983 --> 02:28:59,200
Get out of here.

3415
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,633
Yeah, oh.

3416
02:29:03,383 --> 02:29:05,216
Oh, my God. We just need one more.

3417
02:29:05,216 --> 02:29:06,216
We already found it.

3418
02:29:06,216 --> 02:29:07,883
Please.

3419
02:29:09,533 --> 02:29:10,833
Just one more.

3420
02:29:10,833 --> 02:29:12,033
One more.

3421
02:29:12,033 --> 02:29:13,350
Please. Just.

3422
02:29:14,433 --> 02:29:16,116
My goodness.

3423
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:18,150
I don't.

3424
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:20,033
I don't know how to find it again.

3425
02:29:20,033 --> 02:29:21,933
Yeah, I really.

3426
02:29:21,933 --> 02:29:24,333
I really just want to find it,
and then that's it.

3427
02:29:24,333 --> 02:29:26,550
And then we dones off

3428
02:29:26,783 --> 02:29:28,566
but the question is, where the fuck is it?

3429
02:29:28,566 --> 02:29:28,950
Was it a.

3430
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:30,183
Leading us to a haunted house?

3431
02:29:30,183 --> 02:29:32,700
That's the haunted house that.
I want to go back to.

3432
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:36,266
The first bonfire we ever found

3433
02:29:36,266 --> 02:29:38,283
oh, you're kidding me.

3434
02:29:38,283 --> 02:29:40,983
Yeah. I think it's coming after me.

3435
02:29:42,633 --> 02:29:44,433
Oh, it is.

3436
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

3437
02:29:52,316 --> 02:29:54,066
Circling us.

3438
02:29:54,066 --> 02:29:57,033
See? Bear, see, bear.

3439
02:30:00,183 --> 02:30:01,066
Ants.

3440
02:30:01,916 --> 02:30:04,833
Does this kind of thing go away?

3441
02:30:05,166 --> 02:30:09,833
My IQ inside this house right ike.

3442
02:30:10,583 --> 02:30:12,916
I'm sorry for being loud. I, i.

3443
02:30:13,083 --> 02:30:14,983
Are you in here? Ike?

3444
02:30:14,983 --> 02:30:16,966
Oh, he's out here.

3445
02:30:16,966 --> 02:30:19,016
I had a chat i think.

3446
02:30:19,016 --> 02:30:20,816
He went back to the original house.

3447
02:30:20,816 --> 02:30:21,483
Yeah.

3448
02:30:23,733 --> 02:30:25,383
It'd be a pick up box.

3449
02:30:25,383 --> 02:30:27,116
Mm hmm. Just him updated.

3450
02:30:27,116 --> 02:30:29,100
Oh, keep out the effigy. Oh, he found it.

3451
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:30,816
He found it. Oh, dude. Well, now.

3452
02:30:30,816 --> 02:30:33,183
Where do we have to go
now? Do we? We got to the mausoleum.

3453
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:34,633
The ritual I think we need.

3454
02:30:34,633 --> 02:30:36,383
Yeah, we need to go back to the cemetery.

3455
02:30:36,383 --> 02:30:38,616
Oh, oh, oh, whoa. Six.

3456
02:30:38,616 --> 02:30:39,983
I keep looking.

3457
02:30:40,766 --> 02:30:41,666
Over on.

3458
02:30:43,366 --> 02:30:46,016
Thank you so much for the raid.

3459
02:30:46,016 --> 02:30:46,950
Who raided? Hold on.

3460
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:49,566
Somebody read it, and I didn't get to say
thank you for that.

3461
02:30:50,100 --> 02:30:51,566
Thank you so much for the raid.

3462
02:30:51,566 --> 02:30:52,083
Whoo hoo!

3463
02:30:52,083 --> 02:30:53,816
Who's here. Huh?

3464
02:30:53,816 --> 02:30:55,950
Best dish raid. Only guilty.

3465
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:58,733
Thank you for the raid, dude.

3466
02:30:58,733 --> 02:31:00,866
Hello? Hello, Ike?

3467
02:31:00,866 --> 02:31:02,816
I found it.
I found it. I got it. I got it.

3468
02:31:02,816 --> 02:31:04,133
You got it. Nice.

3469
02:31:05,433 --> 02:31:07,283
We just got to get back to the house
now, right?

3470
02:31:07,283 --> 02:31:08,283
I was in it.

3471
02:31:08,283 --> 02:31:11,316
The ah, the mausoleum that we have to go
to, that's the thing that.

3472
02:31:11,333 --> 02:31:14,550
Was there, like a blade up there
that we needed again or something.

3473
02:31:14,583 --> 02:31:15,233
Or was it.

3474
02:31:15,233 --> 02:31:17,233
Was that what we needed? I don't know.

3475
02:31:18,633 --> 02:31:19,416
To the haunted house?

3476
02:31:19,416 --> 02:31:21,333
You won't go back to the haunted house,
right?

3477
02:31:21,333 --> 02:31:23,583
Well,
I thought there was still something there.

3478
02:31:23,583 --> 02:31:24,483
I is there.

3479
02:31:24,483 --> 02:31:27,816
I thought all we had to do
was just I grab something from there,

3480
02:31:27,816 --> 02:31:31,233
and then we read the book,
and then we got the outline.

3481
02:31:31,233 --> 02:31:34,350
You know, if we grab anything, OK,
maybe we need to go back then and to the

3482
02:31:34,916 --> 02:31:36,933
the cemetery or whatever
the heck it wants, right?

3483
02:31:36,933 --> 02:31:38,416
Yeah. The mausoleum. You know, the master.

3484
02:31:38,416 --> 02:31:41,816
Because there's a door that was sealed off
I think that's where it is.

3485
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:43,383
Demon remove.

3486
02:31:43,383 --> 02:31:47,433
I was actually, like, in front of me,
but she didn't come back for some reason.

3487
02:31:48,383 --> 02:31:51,566
Hmm. Couldn't hear us

3488
02:31:51,566 --> 02:31:52,716
was he here?

3489
02:31:53,516 --> 02:31:54,383
Oh, no, that's fine.

3490
02:31:54,383 --> 02:31:56,133
Smocks, my hair.

3491
02:31:57,083 --> 02:31:59,883
Thank you so much for the radar
on the graveyard.

3492
02:31:59,883 --> 02:32:00,533
A great stream.

3493
02:32:00,533 --> 02:32:02,900
I'll come here. Just reviving afar.

3494
02:32:03,116 --> 02:32:07,016
I've never even seen that thing
very close up.

3495
02:32:07,133 --> 02:32:09,266
It looks like a deer.

3496
02:32:09,266 --> 02:32:10,050
I think.

3497
02:32:10,166 --> 02:32:11,783
Yeah.

3498
02:32:13,766 --> 02:32:14,733
And long arms.

3499
02:32:14,733 --> 02:32:17,966
We oh,

3500
02:32:18,983 --> 02:32:21,483
you're cute when you're young,
both of you.

3501
02:32:21,483 --> 02:32:22,683
Very adorable.

3502
02:32:22,766 --> 02:32:24,600
Oh, yeah.

3503
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:24,966
That's.

3504
02:32:24,966 --> 02:32:27,966
That's how, like, you do it again.

3505
02:32:31,383 --> 02:32:32,133
Is it, son?

3506
02:32:32,133 --> 02:32:32,733
He's like.

3507
02:32:35,216 --> 02:32:35,766
Deep.

3508
02:32:43,466 --> 02:32:44,700
Oh, my God.

3509
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:46,016
Oh, my God. Now, that.

3510
02:32:46,016 --> 02:32:47,700
That was some Ranger

3511
02:32:52,266 --> 02:32:52,683
you're having.

3512
02:32:52,683 --> 02:32:54,633
We're having, like,
some kind of a commune.

3513
02:32:54,633 --> 02:32:58,533
Anyway, I like squeak battle

3514
02:32:58,683 --> 02:33:00,116
squeak off.

3515
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:03,333
I hear reamer, like,
cutting in and out from the distance.

3516
02:33:03,333 --> 02:33:05,033
Yeah, the game does that.

3517
02:33:05,033 --> 02:33:06,666
The game does that.

3518
02:33:06,683 --> 02:33:07,833
Occasionally. You just had, like, a

3519
02:33:09,833 --> 02:33:10,683
yeah,

3520
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,783
but. Oh.

3521
02:33:12,783 --> 02:33:14,916
What what happened?

3522
02:33:15,716 --> 02:33:17,366
What did you do?

3523
02:33:17,366 --> 02:33:18,866
What did she do?

3524
02:33:19,316 --> 02:33:20,366
All now. We're.

3525
02:33:20,366 --> 02:33:21,666
We're kids.

3526
02:33:21,666 --> 02:33:22,383
There it is.

3527
02:33:22,383 --> 02:33:24,300
Zoo were getting clamped by this.

3528
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:25,866
Look at that here.

3529
02:33:25,950 --> 02:33:27,450
What is that?

3530
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:31,016
Hello? Oh.

3531
02:33:31,833 --> 02:33:32,916
Oh, that hurt my stomach.

3532
02:33:32,916 --> 02:33:34,466
Oh, my God.

3533
02:33:35,966 --> 02:33:36,833
It's OK.

3534
02:33:36,833 --> 02:33:38,316
Can't touch us here.

3535
02:33:38,316 --> 02:33:41,100
He's like, dum dum dum dum dum dum.

3536
02:33:45,483 --> 02:33:47,700
You got a friend in me?

3537
02:33:48,666 --> 02:33:50,016
I guess we're going to go.

3538
02:33:50,016 --> 02:33:51,633
He's pretty far away.

3539
02:33:51,816 --> 02:33:53,216
Let's try to find the.

3540
02:33:53,216 --> 02:33:56,133
The cemetery or the mausoleum,
whatever the heck you call it.

3541
02:33:56,583 --> 02:33:59,016
The for and near miles.

3542
02:33:59,016 --> 02:33:59,666
And you're

3543
02:34:01,650 --> 02:34:02,616
she just did it for us.

3544
02:34:02,616 --> 02:34:04,433
I'm pretty sure
Raymond just did it for us.

3545
02:34:04,433 --> 02:34:07,466
Baby River. Oh, my God, Raymond.

3546
02:34:07,466 --> 02:34:08,733
We were just chilling.

3547
02:34:08,733 --> 02:34:11,183
And then suddenly,
where did you get to the next area?

3548
02:34:11,183 --> 02:34:12,266
Did you go to the mausoleum?

3549
02:34:12,266 --> 02:34:14,466
We got stuck.
The monster kept circling us.

3550
02:34:15,483 --> 02:34:17,766
Oh, my goodness.

3551
02:34:17,816 --> 02:34:18,450
I like it.

3552
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:20,333
I think my heart
can take much more of this.

3553
02:34:20,333 --> 02:34:22,616
Yeah,
I think this is a good place to stop.

3554
02:34:22,616 --> 02:34:24,533
Yeah, this is a good place to stop.

3555
02:34:24,533 --> 02:34:27,283
To be honest, we did a lot today. Oh.

3556
02:34:27,966 --> 02:34:29,916
Oh, my God.

3557
02:34:29,916 --> 02:34:32,483
For a. While, it was a lot of fun.

3558
02:34:32,483 --> 02:34:33,083
Making

3559
02:34:34,916 --> 02:34:36,933
chicken complete
this game one of the day, though.

3560
02:34:36,966 --> 02:34:39,000
I'm really curious of the other chapters.

3561
02:34:39,233 --> 02:34:39,983
Yeah, I think.

3562
02:34:39,983 --> 02:34:42,216
Like Dame of Carrie at the end there.

3563
02:34:42,516 --> 02:34:43,433
Yeah, you carried us.

3564
02:34:43,433 --> 02:34:45,450
We couldn't go anywhere, so thank. You.

3565
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:47,466
Yeah, we were surrounded by the big deer.

3566
02:34:47,466 --> 02:34:48,366
Bitch.

3567
02:34:48,566 --> 02:34:50,583
We just hanging out here?

3568
02:34:50,583 --> 02:34:51,266
Yeah.

3569
02:34:51,666 --> 02:34:53,700
He's deer. Bitch.

3570
02:34:54,066 --> 02:34:56,283
I don't like. That you

3571
02:34:57,416 --> 02:34:58,983
ok. OK.

3572
02:34:59,333 --> 02:35:01,016
Well, how do we exit this?

3573
02:35:01,016 --> 02:35:03,666
I don't know how you exit this arm.

3574
02:35:04,350 --> 02:35:05,583
Oh, go to sleep.

3575
02:35:05,583 --> 02:35:07,500
I don't think it's a safe lane.

3576
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:09,483
It is. I'll go to lobby intended.

3577
02:35:10,433 --> 02:35:11,816
I think that's all.

3578
02:35:11,933 --> 02:35:13,983
Hello. Here we are.

3579
02:35:13,983 --> 02:35:15,900
There he go. Lobby.

3580
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:17,816
Yeah, I think this is right.

3581
02:35:17,816 --> 02:35:19,916
You may go back to this court
just to say bye.

3582
02:35:20,366 --> 02:35:21,966
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

3583
02:35:21,966 --> 02:35:22,166
Hold on.

3584
02:35:22,166 --> 02:35:24,783
Let me put your guys's volumes
back to normal again.

3585
02:35:24,966 --> 02:35:28,616
Yeah, I remember to turn off,
like, your voice activity in the game.

3586
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:30,166
Yeah. Push it out.

3587
02:35:31,266 --> 02:35:31,500
Push.

3588
02:35:31,533 --> 02:35:33,033
It's OK.

3589
02:35:36,366 --> 02:35:38,100
Hello?

3590
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:38,433
Hello.

3591
02:35:38,433 --> 02:35:41,033
Oh, oh, oh.

3592
02:35:42,066 --> 02:35:43,133
There we go.

3593
02:35:43,133 --> 02:35:45,750
Oh, my goodness.

3594
02:35:45,750 --> 02:35:47,916
Whoo! Boy! How was something?

3595
02:35:48,150 --> 02:35:49,266
That was a lot. I do.

3596
02:35:49,266 --> 02:35:51,116
I don't know. How finnane on Lucca.

3597
02:35:51,116 --> 02:35:52,716
They did this in, like, six and seven.

3598
02:35:52,716 --> 02:35:55,166
They played this for 7 hours
or something like that.

3599
02:35:55,166 --> 02:35:57,116
Yeah, I would have guy and died.

3600
02:35:57,116 --> 02:35:58,116
They just they just, like,

3601
02:35:58,116 --> 02:36:02,283
continued on, like it the entire night
and, like, made it to the end somehow.

3602
02:36:02,283 --> 02:36:03,783
Built this. Friend. Yeah,

3603
02:36:04,733 --> 02:36:06,266
I could not do that.

3604
02:36:06,266 --> 02:36:07,716
Did they clear the whole game?

3605
02:36:07,716 --> 02:36:10,466
Yeah, they clear the whole game. Oh, wow.

3606
02:36:11,016 --> 02:36:14,883
Well, we have we're not going
to let ourselves be outdone.

3607
02:36:14,883 --> 02:36:17,183
Let's do this again
sometime. Yeah, definitely.

3608
02:36:17,766 --> 02:36:19,166
We can finish this.

3609
02:36:19,166 --> 02:36:23,066
And because we have two more chapters
left, right, it looks like two or three

3610
02:36:23,066 --> 02:36:23,850
more chapters off.

3611
02:36:23,850 --> 02:36:25,866
Yeah, I think it looks like it. Yeah.

3612
02:36:25,866 --> 02:36:27,783
If you look on the board. Yeah.

3613
02:36:27,783 --> 02:36:31,083
If we can look at the blade

3614
02:36:31,083 --> 02:36:32,516
through.

3615
02:36:32,783 --> 02:36:34,583
Three, more. Like.

3616
02:36:34,583 --> 02:36:36,816
Through productive voice.

3617
02:36:37,016 --> 02:36:38,283
Actually.

3618
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:39,266
I take a look at it.

3619
02:36:39,266 --> 02:36:42,250
We can finish this
and in a second livestream yeah.

3620
02:36:42,383 --> 02:36:44,516
Yeah, for sure. We can have chapter four.

3621
02:36:45,266 --> 02:36:46,950
Look at that. Yeah,
we did literally. Yeah.

3622
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:50,366
Next time we can like end this off
since there's only one seat.

3623
02:36:50,433 --> 02:36:52,383
Yeah,
there should be only six chapters, right?

3624
02:36:52,383 --> 02:36:55,116
Because yeah, it looks like
there's only room for six chapters. Hmm.

3625
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:57,633
Chapter four. But
is it really long before you let me chat?

3626
02:36:57,666 --> 02:37:00,633
So I think we just finished this
in the, in the next collab.

3627
02:37:00,633 --> 02:37:01,466
I guess yeah.

3628
02:37:01,466 --> 02:37:01,883
Yeah.

3629
02:37:02,216 --> 02:37:04,533
Sounds good. Sounds like a plan. OK, yeah.

3630
02:37:05,216 --> 02:37:07,533
All right. Thank you guys for coming by.

3631
02:37:07,533 --> 02:37:09,816
It was really fun going to play with you
all again.

3632
02:37:09,816 --> 02:37:13,083
Yeah, it was something that wasn't,
you know, like we promised.

3633
02:37:13,416 --> 02:37:14,466
Oh, my God.

3634
02:37:14,466 --> 02:37:16,650
I remember that was like,
oh, let's do this again.

3635
02:37:16,650 --> 02:37:18,450
Just not, you know. Yeah.

3636
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:22,350
Oh, thank you for inviting us.

3637
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:25,283
It was really fun. Yeah.
Thank you for wanting to play.

3638
02:37:25,316 --> 02:37:26,016
It was really.

3639
02:37:26,016 --> 02:37:27,316
Yeah, I love that.

3640
02:37:27,316 --> 02:37:30,183
That was a lot of fun. Really. It was.

3641
02:37:30,183 --> 02:37:32,866
OK. I'll see you guys around.

3642
02:37:32,866 --> 02:37:33,966
Bye, guys.

3643
02:37:33,966 --> 02:37:35,333
Bye bye.

3644
02:37:35,333 --> 02:37:37,200
Take care.

3645
02:37:37,583 --> 02:37:39,966
OK, let's see

3646
02:37:42,366 --> 02:37:44,483
Gonna go back to the bedroom, guys.

3647
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:46,283
So give me a second.

3648
02:37:51,483 --> 02:37:54,483
Oh, oh.

3649
02:37:56,516 --> 02:37:59,433
Oh. Well,
I guess saw the bedroom overlays.

3650
02:37:59,433 --> 02:38:01,983
Don't want to show off
for some reason. Unlucky.

3651
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:05,583
What the heck, brah?

3652
02:38:05,583 --> 02:38:07,800
Yeah, they just don't want to show up

3653
02:38:08,016 --> 02:38:09,133
there.

3654
02:38:09,516 --> 02:38:10,816
All right,

3655
02:38:13,133 --> 02:38:15,183
And my music's not playing.

3656
02:38:15,183 --> 02:38:17,916
It's, like, up

3657
02:38:18,066 --> 02:38:20,616
rolling. OK.

3658
02:38:20,616 --> 02:38:24,083
Oh, we gotta play for a long time.

3659
02:38:24,083 --> 02:38:26,616
I'm really glad that everyone enjoyed
that.

3660
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,850
Sorry, I wasn't talking or chat too much
because I did want to focus on the game

3661
02:38:32,133 --> 02:38:33,916
and some just, you know,

3662
02:38:33,916 --> 02:38:38,433
make sure that we were getting through
or, like, make sure that everybody was.

3663
02:38:38,616 --> 02:38:42,533
I was giving, like, my full attention
to the the game in the collapsible aisle.

3664
02:38:42,533 --> 02:38:43,650
We were through some of the donations

3665
02:38:43,650 --> 02:38:45,650
and stuff right now
because I didn't get to see that.

3666
02:38:45,666 --> 02:38:49,166
All of that while I'm
everything was everything was going down

3667
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:51,866
because all the monsters, dude.
All the fucking monsters.

3668
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:52,716
Oh, my God.

3669
02:38:55,983 --> 02:38:59,133
The Miyagi, they for the $3

3670
02:38:59,366 --> 02:39:03,116

that really got your heart off

3671
02:39:04,233 --> 02:39:04,916
I like Alec.

3672
02:39:04,916 --> 02:39:06,900
Having those little moments were far in.

3673
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:09,083
Not just with me both. Like I can remove.

3674
02:39:09,083 --> 02:39:10,216
It's really fun, right?

3675
02:39:10,216 --> 02:39:12,300
I think that's like a part of, like,
the appeal, that scheme.

3676
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:15,750
When you do get separated, you're
kind of like forced to have a, you know.

3677
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:18,233
Of a little.

3678
02:39:18,233 --> 02:39:20,433
Fun interaction with whoever

3679
02:39:20,883 --> 02:39:23,333

I don't think I can sing a song

3720
02:41:09,416 --> 02:41:11,616

We're playing tomorrow.
Stanley Parable. Right.

3756
02:42:37,883 --> 02:42:42,183
So reason why we re playing the game
is because we didn't get to finish.

3757
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:45,233
We didn't get to finish the game last time
because we got cuts.

3758
02:42:45,533 --> 02:42:48,116
Looking forward to the collab. Again.

3759
02:42:48,116 --> 02:42:49,466
Now we got some last time.

3760
02:42:49,466 --> 02:42:52,800
We tried to play it because of like
a bunch of internet issues.

3761
02:42:54,033 --> 02:42:57,033
So hopefully this time
there's going to be no issues.

3762
02:42:57,083 --> 02:42:58,583
We try to play a game again.

3763
02:42:58,583 --> 02:43:02,100
Let's just hope it doesn't,
you know, mess itself up.

It was really fun.

3768
02:43:07,866 --> 02:43:09,566
I love getting to play with these guys

3769
02:43:09,566 --> 02:43:12,416
and I hope we get to play a different game
sometime in the future.

3770
02:43:12,750 --> 02:43:16,283

OK, who's around.

02:46:21,683 --> 02:46:25,233
All gossip to belong gossip.

3843
02:46:25,283 --> 02:46:28,733
The Nana are cute.

3844
02:46:28,866 --> 02:46:30,916
Oh, yeah.

02:46:35,966 --> 02:46:39,366
They're gonna the nugget gone.

3849
02:46:40,116 --> 02:46:43,016
I think we can go and read who?

3850
02:46:43,016 --> 02:46:43,616
Oh, my God.

3851
02:46:43,616 --> 02:46:44,183
I don't know.

3852
02:46:44,183 --> 02:46:46,766
Now, a lot of people are alive
at the moment.

3853
02:46:46,766 --> 02:46:48,383
I could just look around.

3854
02:46:48,383 --> 02:46:51,800
The tributes are maybe on

3855
02:46:53,850 --> 02:46:54,966
Polly's still alive.

3856
02:46:54,966 --> 02:46:57,866
I mean, you can go read Polly again,
but we are afraid of Polly recently.

3857
02:46:57,883 --> 02:46:59,400
Jamie Foxx

3858
02:47:00,533 --> 02:47:01,666
yeah. Let me look around.

3859
02:47:01,666 --> 02:47:04,916
Let's see,
who can we go and share some love with

3860
02:47:07,716 --> 02:47:10,233
I i-i-i-i-i.

3861
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:16,016
I'm hot, hot, hot, hot.

3862
02:47:16,383 --> 02:47:18,450
You're so cute. I love you.

3863
02:47:18,450 --> 02:47:19,583
I love you guys. Yeah,

3864
02:47:20,666 --> 02:47:22,800
I guess they beg for a second.

3865
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:25,616
I like a one big
some people like one big deal.

3866
02:47:26,166 --> 02:47:28,783
Not, you know, that that way, but,
you know,

3867
02:47:28,816 --> 02:47:31,800
I mean, we're big, OK?

3868
02:47:33,116 --> 02:47:33,866
I don't see.

3869
02:47:33,866 --> 02:47:34,550

02:47:38,016 --> 02:47:39,116
an all white.

3872
02:47:39,116 --> 02:47:41,300
You know what I think

3873
02:47:42,566 --> 02:47:46,716
I think we're just going to go and ride

3874
02:47:52,266 --> 02:47:54,333
actually, Louise live.

3875
02:47:54,333 --> 02:47:57,150
I don't think we've rated Lumi in a while.

3876
02:47:57,150 --> 02:47:58,166
Yeah, you know what?

3877
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,483
Let's all.

3878
02:48:00,783 --> 02:48:03,300
Let's read Lumi.

3879
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:05,366
Momo is also live. Fuck.

3880
02:48:05,366 --> 02:48:06,866
Oh, there's only two options.

3881
02:48:06,866 --> 02:48:08,966
OK, ok.
You know what? I'm just going to slide.

3882
02:48:08,966 --> 02:48:09,783
Eeny, meeny, my name.

3883
02:48:09,783 --> 02:48:12,183
