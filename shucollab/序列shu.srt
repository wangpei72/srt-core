1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,516
Hi. Hello.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,100
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,350
Oh, my God. Hold on. Give me a second.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,516
Your Hey, guys.

5
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:12,600
What's up?

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,200
Um, so I wanted to talk about our new set

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,166
up real quick on the R for the, um.

8
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:25,400
What's it called? The bedroom.
Yeah. Right.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,116
So I thought it'd be very cool
to, you know, change some things up

10
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,266
and make it look prettier.

11
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,566
So that's why I've been spending the past,

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,083
you know, couple of hours doing
it looks really cool.

13
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,783
Also, if you do, what's it called?

14
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:41,066
If you do a, um.

15
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,550
If somebody gifts.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,750
I think. Was it.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,466
I forgot what the thing was.

18
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,716
If somebody donates, like, more than 50

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,266
and then or, like, more than 1000 bits,

20
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:55,966
or if a raid happens something special
or something cool pops up on the screen.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,216
Hold on.

22
00:00:56,216 --> 00:01:00,116
Let me show you guys because I think, you
know, it'd be really cool to show.

23
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:01,650
Let me just show you instead.

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,333
So no one has to like,
you know, do anything thing.

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,750
I think it's really cool. Uh,

26
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,166
I'm just.

27
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,100
It looks super sick, dude.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,900
Oh, my gosh. Look.

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,800
Look at that.

30
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah. I don't know who did it.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,683
But. Yeah,
so the new alerts are a full screen thingy

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,533
which pops up
depending on how much you donate.

33
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:26,816
So people that donate like 1000 bits
or over $50 or, um,

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,016
I think if somebody reads,
they'll have like that special alert

35
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:33,566
pop up on the screen
as like a video game overlay effects.

36
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:35,116
And I think that's really sick.

37
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:37,466
Yeah, it's really cool, right?

38
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,166
I like it so much on all of these assets.

39
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,483
I got R for free from
my friends are free RAF

40
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:46,133
from Ushio and Wonder Penguin

41
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,550
Oh, thank you for the bits, Joss.

42
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,350
Thank you so much, dude.

43
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:52,850
Yeah, it's really cool.

44
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,216
It's actually,
it feels actually like a video game.

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,450
It's called the Great Sage
Streamer on Arts Online Puck.

46
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,233
So if you guys are interested,
it's, ah, it's out there

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,650
for other people to use still.

48
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,533
I just want to use it myself
because I thought it was pretty darn cool.

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,750
So today we're going to be playing Wafaa,

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,316
or I'm playing with Lily.

51
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh, let me see. Playing with Lily.

52
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,733
Shoo!

53
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,916
Albert's scar.

54
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,683
And then that's it.

55
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:26,366
Yeah, we're playing with a lot of people
today, and I'm super ex-army.

56
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:30,016
Invites shoo in a means of a party

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,150
Oh. Oh.

58
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,533
Yeah. I'm like.

59
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,616
We were, like, um, very last minute with

60
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,566
because everybody was,
like, doing their own thing.

61
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:41,816
It was, like, only me and all Kate.

62
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,650
We're getting cute in. Hold up.

63
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,216
Ah, Bella. Shopping for the gift solves.

64
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,383
Thank you for all the bits, guys,
and for the.

65
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:51,433
I'll try and read through everything
at the end of stream America.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,700
I see it, so.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,550
Hold on. Let me.

68
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,983
Let me turn on my

69
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,500
way. I'm on. Right. Hello?

70
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,033
Oh, there you go.

71
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,650
Hello, y'all. Sorry.

72
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,250
Yeah, I just want to a chat real quick.

73
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,966
What's up?

74
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,066
We're just.

75
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,050
We're just in the lobby.

76
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,533
Oh, my God. My building is like, 85, four.

77
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:10,466
Hold on.

78
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,016
I we're playing California.
Okay? That's what.

79
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:13,700
I did.

80
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
I saw around

81
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:16,800
where we are.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,166
We maybe Central. Rudy Central.

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,566
It's like, you know, even it out, I think.

84
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,066
Okay.

85
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:22,850
Okay.

86
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:25,916
Central.

87
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,233
Central.

88
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,050
Well, our. You've been.

89
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,100
You've been fucking climbing.

90
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,766
You kind of just running up the ladder.

91
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,400
Yes. I'm trying very hard to get better.

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,783
Okay. Oh.

93
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,733
Max. And.

94
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,050
Oh, by the way, nice to meet you. I'm Shu.

95
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,683
Hello, Shu. I'm pleased. To meet. You.

96
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,250
Oh, you're both.

97
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,600
I already said that. I

98
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,400
Oh, well, you didn't differ my strength.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,716
It's nice to meet you guys.

100
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:55,466
Nice to meet you.

101
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,283
Shu finally gets a couple of.

102
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:00,950
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, she's finally there.

103
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,450
Yeah, I tell you something.

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,666
Together.

105
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,050
What's up? Off dream we have.

106
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,350
Yeah, we.

107
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,516
Played Florence off stream,

108
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:12,416
but we haven't gone,
so doing an actual collab just yet.

109
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,616
Alexander's our first one.
Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,116
Yeah, he

111
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,400
Mm hmm.

112
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:22,666
It was so. Big.

113
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,816
I can't play Viper.

114
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:28,133
I'm, like, literally in a maple to.

115
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:29,416
Like.

116
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,416
Go play arena.

117
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,800
And that way we're playing on Breeze Okay.

118
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,383
Ah, I'm not tired of this game.

119
00:04:39,383 --> 00:04:41,000
Just if I look over.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,766
Oh, here we're playing.
Yeah. It's all good.

121
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,066
This is my first time playing ranked.

122
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,633
And I can't.

123
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:49,916
Yeah, we are fucking omega.

124
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,766
Carrie. Albert

125
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,383
has been coached, like, three times.

126
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,066
Oh, coached oh.

127
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,600
We hired a sexy coach.

128
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:01,883
Okay, hold on.

129
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:03,200
Let me put.

130
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,083
You know, I've got the arena.

131
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,216
I'm comfortable for.

132
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,083
Her. OK.

133
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,116
You guys, you listen to music
when you play violent, by the way, or. No.

134
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,916
I think it's more entertaining,
but it's a bit harder to focus.

135
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,500
Yeah, it.

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,016
Is. Yeah.

137
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,333
Like, I cannot focus with music.

138
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,300
Because, like, the footsteps still. Yeah.

139
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,000
It's like there's a

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,966
there's a quite a few audio cues
that I've learnt, like, OK, that I got to,

141
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,616
like, look out for that.

142
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:31,516
A guy cranking music up. OK.

143
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:33,200
Yes. Yes.

144
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,900
If you crank it up, the fade like death
in doesn't even matter

145
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,150
you just get used to it.

146
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,600
You know what, you're, you're right.

147
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,400
The ability doesn't matter.

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Claim playing every round cause I can't.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh, actually.

150
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,950
Oh, cover the mass.

151
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,300
Yeah.

152
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,750
Um, where I'm
like I'm going to, I'll sit and tube

153
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:57,716
Yeah.

154
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,200
It's a tube. Yeah. OK, yeah.

155
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Whatever this is called,
I call it tube because it's a long tube.

156
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:04,666
Right?

157
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,716
Oh, let me see.

158
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,916
It's like to put up

159
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:17,866
literally stream it.

160
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:18,900
Or you're still setting up your shoe.

161
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,966
Shop because.

162
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,900
I was like,
oh, wait, we're going to the server.

163
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,883
So I was like, Okay, sure.

164
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,433
I mean, be it to be. Okay.

165
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,666
Everything okay?

166
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,666
I'm coming. I'm coming. They're coming.

167
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:32,783
Oh, they are all pushed in.

168
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:35,483
What the heck? Oh.

169
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,100
Phoenix at 78.

170
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,750
Spike planted.

171
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,166
Lot to.

172
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,666
Nice to nice to.

173
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,233
Chamberlain 26.

174
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,783
It's iPad.

175
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,216
Is it all right you.

176
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:54,350
All. Yeah.

177
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:00,266
One that's on the back side.

178
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:03,750
If you can approach the bum now

179
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,066
we actually get low on time.

180
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:07,900

I'm going to people.

268
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,166
It's okay.

269
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,233
That means they have less space
to go through.

270
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,050
It's gonna work out.

271
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,050

One day show two visited my stream,

He actually called the shoe.

I hope. They're OK.

335
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,933

With you with what's died. Now.

557
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:50,483
Where did you die?

558
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,950
I died back set, but they probably
grabbed it and ran somewhere.

559
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,316
Oh, it's right. Oh, there it is.

560

565
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:07,616
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was your op,
and I killed the person who killed you.

566
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,400
Hmm. This op has lived for, like,
five rounds now.

567
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,483
Nice. And got all this round.

00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,833
ok. I see a lot of action.

643
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,833
This is not a good space.

644
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,133
Oh. 30 seconds.

Nice area.

I got it inside my eyes.

651
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,283
Switching sides.

652
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,500
You guys are kind of.

Yeah. So good.

Like I can buy a guardian for Skara.

788
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,166
But people who can't buy,
I just take a guy, take my gun when I die.

789
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,616
Yeah,
I would. Just take your gun when he died.

790
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,100

00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:44,483
What?

803
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:44,966

00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:56,933
And I'm actually so insane.

808
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,116
That was a good play now.

809
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:00,150
Oh, that's.

OK? OK.

821
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,533
Yeah, I'll just run through the money.

I can, honestly.

864
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,250
Well, I didn't get the memo to save.

865
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,500
I didn't do my maths, right. Oh.

866
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:38,850
No, it's fine.

867
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,316
It's fine.

868
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:42,433
The way I was paper things.

869
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, OK. We want you to fall. OK, listen.

870
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,983
Unless you want us to run up me

871
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:49,616
because I could just smoke mid
and we could just do some stupid shit.

872
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,616
I can. All. Huh? How about this?
I was all.

873
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,600
I'll rather me.

874
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600

875
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,633
And so you guys choose whether
I don't care what the hell you guys do.

He's just better.

881
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:22,100
He's stuck 93,
but he's can heal it all back up

882
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:29,683
if I had the needle there.

883
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,400
It's time to jump.

884
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,566
This is so intense.

885
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:42,933
I think they're just holding. Yeah.

886
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:46,450
So I don't think they want to push up.

887
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:56,150
And anybody like.

888
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:58,650

00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,683
OK? Yeah, I'm
going to pick a soup as well.

920
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,966

922
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,800
Enemy spotted.

923
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,350
If there was one.

924
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,466
Box, why do I have to spike.

925
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:41,366
Spikes to drop this one begins to.

926
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,616
Get his vision. Hang him.

927
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:44,416
No one.

928
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,466
There's someone in the fridge area.

929
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,283
Yeah. Stay

930
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,383

931
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,883
Oh, oh.

932
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh, my God.

933
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,316
He just ran.

934
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,833
Ran through the doors. Wants to see.

935
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,533
That player standing.

936
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,316
On the whole bit.

937
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:09,666
I. I didn't think that would buy me.

938
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,416
That was like in the corner.

939
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,616
Of all corners.

940
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,983

Great.

945
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:27,683
It was here is right in front of us.

946
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:29,016
And she she.

947
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,100
Swung after you. Well.

948
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,600
I didn't see I actually didn't see her.

949
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,866
That's Nancy
she must've been invisible or something.

950
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,066
Yeah.

951
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,566
Oh, yeah.

952
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,150
She had her old see, she got a free orb.

953
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,500
OK, let's see.

954
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,850
All right.

955
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,766
Yes, everyone. Bye for now.

956
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:48,116
Safe and say, look, I will.

957
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:49,366
I don't know what will I do?

958
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,200
Believe that flash.

959
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,116
Or I'll do this.

960
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,266
Welcome to my world.

961
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,883
Of course.

962
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,083
To my world.

963
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,116
It's her world
I don't want to go through anymore.

964
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,483
I'm sorry.

965
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,550
Is that is that there?

966
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,700
Marshall's my.

967
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,183
It's all yours.

968
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:08,900
Oh, here,

969
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,483

970
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,266
Oh, we have two marshals. OK. Yeah.

00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:25,133
Goes low. That's the only one I got.

975
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:26,066
I'm scared.

976
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:26,516
I'll take that.

977
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:28,366

Yeah, well.

981
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:42,750
If it was, it was a good idea
or it was interesting.

982
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,900
Oh, OK. She's in. Was it.

983
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,550
She was.

984
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,983
Not oh.

985
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,416
Betty Lindsay N.S.A..

986
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:51,983
You might find her.

987
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:52,866
Go push your.

988
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,100
Eyes to your rescue. Yeah.

989
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,216
Oh, honest. Yellow sunglasses come now.

990
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,183
It's like.

991
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,533
Oh, sorry, dude.

992
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,216
He was so close.

993
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,850
Let them.

994
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,850
If I had the fucking ham plate food.

995
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,016
I thought so, too,
but they were looking at it.

996
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:16,133
Oh, dude, 93 curse is actually real.

997
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:18,266
What the heck always happens?

998
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,133
You're throwing.

999
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,250
You know what you get.

1000
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,183
Throw it down the halls if you want that.
What's funny, dude?

1001
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:23,933
I actually thought.

1002
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,716
I thought 93
curse was just the mean lights action.

1003
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,350
And people
throwing mad blows without viper.

1004
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:31,666
Yeah.

1005
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,433

1006
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,016

1015
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,500
When out doors.

1016
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,816
What do you mean?

1017
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:19,766
I don't know.

1018
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,950

Oh, no. Oh.

No charges left.

1029
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:55,800

That's where it came from.

1036
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,116
No idea.

1037
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,816
Oh, oh,

Whoever is doing the salads.

1054
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,433
Oh, my God. I should.
Should I turn those off?

1055
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,533
Because it might throw me off.
Oh, my gosh. Stressful moment.

1056
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,183
Hold on. Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1057
00:43:17,183 --> 00:43:19,200
So now all for now, just in case. Here.

You ready?

Only ones here. Oh. Ooh.

00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:34,883
I'm miserable. OK.

1065
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:37,300
Which I do here. Lily, what do you think?

1066
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,983
I can. Never mind. I can't do anything.

1067
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:39,866
We're just going to leave.

1068
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,866
Yeah, and that's an option.

1069
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,350
I'm not to kill you.

1070
00:43:46,316 --> 00:43:48,716
Hopefully I can get a kill

1071
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,866

1072
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,250
Oh, actually, that's it. That's it.

1073
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,316
That's really

1074
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,400

1075
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,500
Did you all this? Yeah. Warn us.

1076
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,150

Be quick.

00:44:08,116 --> 00:44:09,216
Inside our show.

1083
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,600
You got this on the right, right?

1084
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:13,433
I have this bike.

00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,300

Oh, did I thought I was one of you guys?

1088
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:21,083
Those are two people right there.

1089
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,050

I'm not that smart though.

You are the very.

1282
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,250
Reason why we were able to get that over
time. Oh.

1283
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,283
Let's go the most nutty flick.

1284
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:07,583
Oh. I'm glad. You.

1285
00:52:08,816 --> 00:52:11,350
Like, I think more than 90 seconds
to go to the bathroom, right? Oh.

1286
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All we do is take you.

1287
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:15,616
Oh, I.

1288
00:52:15,616 --> 00:52:18,866
Press the and I try to press start game,
but you already press it, so I

1289
00:52:18,866 --> 00:52:20,250

1290
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:23,900
oh, oh.

1291
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,650
On. We do a kissy thing for the doll.

1292
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,450
No, me are.

1293
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,000
Thank you for the 10,000 bets Mia.
Oh my God. Yeah.

1294
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:30,833
So for people

1295
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:34,983
that didn't see that alert information
that only happens when people are

1296
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:39,050
I think it was like more than 1000 berries
or like $50

1297
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,666
or I don't know, I can't do it
for like a summer gift solves

1298
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43,466
for some reason
I don't know how to do that,

1299
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:48,016
but that cooler pops up now
whenever we get something big.

1300
00:52:48,016 --> 00:52:50,300
So maybe I can show it again. Let me see

1301
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,450
OK. For everybody

1302
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:56,416
where is it

1303
00:52:57,116 --> 00:52:58,500
like this?

1304
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:02,866
Pretty cool.

1305
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:04,216
I like it a lot.

1306
00:53:04,216 --> 00:53:06,616
You have to adjust it though,
because it's new.

1307
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:10,400
I haven't played with this that much yet.

1308
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:13,400
Oh, let's see.

1309
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,216
What do I have in my store right now?

1310
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,416
Oh. Aristocrat Vandal.

1311
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,066
I have.

1312
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,700
What is this?

1313
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,716
OK, I can't even look. Oh.

1314
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,300
Splay. OK.

1315
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,450
I like the smell. Hmm.

1316
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,983
I feel cosy here.

1317
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:39,450
I know this
like the back of my head split.

1318
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,416
Yeah. You know, I hate. I hate fracture.
I don't understand.

1319
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,866
That map tool is like not too much.

1320
00:53:45,866 --> 00:53:46,650
Yeah.

1321
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,266
Overloads and

1322
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,983
and it's, you know.

1323
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,366
Well, I try wife.

1324
00:53:58,816 --> 00:53:59,900
Oh. Babe.

1325
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,950
Yeah, she's really cool.
I like her. I like.

1326
00:54:02,966 --> 00:54:04,700
I can't want.

1327
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:13,950
The new death
and really, really, it's different.

1328
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:16,733
Like, yeah,

1329
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,616
this is the first time anyone's had, like,
some kind of joughin.

1330
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:22,566
Right? Right. It's really cool.

1331
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:26,116
The moment I've realised
how much I've relied on my ears when i go.

1332
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:28,316
There it is.

1333
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:30,750
Yeah, it's insane.

1334
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,350
You need to learn.

1335
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,950
Learn how to play, like, without sound.

1336
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,333
I mean, enzymes.

1337
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,966
But i think in general,
that's why I started.

1338
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,550
But you started
laughing in the last round round.

1339
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,000
You know who in general who?

1340
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,400
OK. Oh, shoot.

1341
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,000
I have a question.

1342
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,100
Who do you think the hottest fella
and character is?

1343
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,516
I think it's Ullman personally.

1344
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:54,616
That's just me, though. Oh.

1345
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:57,750
Oh, man. OK,

1346
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,750
I think Chambers a pretty popular team.

1347
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,616
Very. Yeah.

1348
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:03,016

mocking my second.

1363
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:37,050
Oh, my gosh.

1364
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:39,766
How did you do that?

1365
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:40,800
Now, what's.

What was that?

1395
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:53,266
I didn't realise you reached the audience.

1396
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:56,750
Oh, the sky. OK.

1397
00:56:57,516 --> 00:56:58,816
The hold.

00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:01,583
My fingers are so stiff,
I can learn something.

1399
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:02,816
Oh, I'm cold.

1400
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:04,550
Yeah. It takes, like, 2 hours.

1401
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,050
To, like, turn off, right?

1402
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,966
Yeah. He's a laugh.

1403

I had that happen to me before. Right?
You like something?

Yeah, I tried to get the slide down.

1492
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,216
Can cover.

1493
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,116

01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:56,150
So delays there. Push, right.

01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,000
Oh, my God. I'm afraid.

1508
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,100

01:01:37,366 --> 01:01:40,200
If I die to that, I would be released.

1513
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,766
I think they know I'm coming.

1514
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:49,083
Eagles

1515
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:54,000
amass scars, take a lot of heat
you can walk up show.

1516
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:55,516
Last player still.

1517
01:01:55,516 --> 01:01:59,100
Oh 45 this you.

1518
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,200

01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,116
Oh, my God.

1520
01:02:05,116 --> 01:02:06,050
Oh, my God.

1521
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,616
And you suck here

1522
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,150
feeling sad?

1523
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,466
Oh, no.

1524
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:13,550
Oh, oh.

1525
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,266
I needed a gun.

1526
01:02:14,266 --> 01:02:16,400
Was there a gun on heaven
actually gone to heaven. Fuck.

1527
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,766
Maybe I don't know. The Omen was there.

1528
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,983
Oracle Scala where we'll take our next

1529
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,316
where should I set up Lily?

1530
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:28,950
There. They're just dodging it.

1531
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,833
And they're specifically avoiding you.

1532
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:31,316
Let me go, man.

1533
01:02:31,316 --> 01:02:35,150
Let me go. It OK.

1534
01:02:36,316 --> 01:02:38,816
I did three, five night terror.

1535
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,850
What is. It? A good idea?

1536
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:43,583
The cover my map is
because that's told me to do that.

1537
01:02:44,033 --> 01:02:45,650
You can

1538
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:48,716
oh, to avoid is like snipers.

1539
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:52,066
Yeah, I didn't know that was an issue.

1540
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:54,900
Sewers like your sewers. A

1541
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,300
and I think those are a yeah.

1542
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,366
They're just thought.

1543
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:03,316
Wish you

1544
01:03:04,766 --> 01:03:05,966
what happened to have no.

1545
01:03:05,966 --> 01:03:06,683
Thank you.

1546
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,083
I'm going to get away from that
play for a retake.

1547
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:15,166
Let's look at how

1548
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,733
the pressure I'm having.

1549
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:22,033
They're all on to site now.

1550
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,833
We know. Oh.

1551
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,633
Freak back every.

1552
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,966
Last oh landing.

1553
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:30,683
My fingers are still. Planted

1554
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,483
feeling safe.

1555
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,600
OK, I'll

1556
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:52,600
know who

1557
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,183
what.

1558
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:58,466
Oh, nice try. Nice try.

1559
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,866
All right, let's stop again.

1560
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:03,800
They can't just perfectly
avoid you forever.

1561
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,950
That's true.

1562
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:07,316
You have to mess up at least once.

1563
01:04:07,316 --> 01:04:10,550
I'll tell you what, I only go offensively
because I definitely.

1564
01:04:12,566 --> 01:04:14,416
I'm like, over here

1565
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:16,116
yeah.

1566
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:18,716
All right, OK.

1567
01:04:18,716 --> 01:04:20,216
Let's see

1568
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:25,016
well, god,
I don't know what to buy, Sheriff.

1569
01:04:25,016 --> 01:04:27,516
Howdy, howdy.

1570
01:04:27,516 --> 01:04:28,183
Howdy.

1571
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:29,150
Howdy.

1572
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,616
OK, there will be.

1573
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:39,650
I think it's mid. Well, why?

1574
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,266
How are they always avoiding you?

1575
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:43,966
Was opposite of me.

1576
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:46,283
This guy. This is.

1577
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:47,300
They'll feel this.

1578
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,283
But I voted by that.

1579
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:51,300
Initial midst.

1580
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,150
No, I don't. Know where they're at.
They're really late.

1581
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:53,650
They're really late.

1582
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,666
They're really careful going through

1583
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:56,716
again.

1584
01:04:56,716 --> 01:04:58,966
I'm almost like,
yeah, I'm also going to be OK.

1585
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,166
Oh, there's one.

1586
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:02,333
There's one. Romney, Mitt.

1587
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,766
Just looking.

1588
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:05,416
To Mitt.

1589
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,900
Oh, yeah.

1590
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,250
Can I have that for sure?

1591
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:11,916
Yeah.

1592
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,816
Raise any sky heavy now.

1593
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:17,000
They're still having this to heaven
right now.

1594
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,450
OK, thank you.

1595
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,583
You don't want to be.

1596
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,850
Spike planted.

1597
01:05:32,866 --> 01:05:34,316
Oh, oh, oh.

1598
01:05:34,316 --> 01:05:36,166
I'm on the walls.

1599
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:37,916
Whoa.

1600
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,066
Oh, OK.

1601
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:42,150
This is rough stuff.

1602
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,400
Oh, we're. Live. Wimberley.

1603
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,950
I really don't want to jinx it for you,
but you can pick this that you go

1604
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,116
and I'll go the other way. Let's say.

1605
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,800
You go. See. A scene.

1606
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,766
Yeah, go see. Good. See?

1607
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:57,316
You see, I think.

1608
01:05:57,316 --> 01:05:59,550
I believe that one day you'll get to play
the game.

1609
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,416
I'm just going to go.

1610
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:01,050
I'm just go.

1611
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:04,166
If he just tells you no big deal. Hmm.

1612
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,050
Do they have to cancel all your sites
eventually?

1613
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,450
Right. There's no way.

1614
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:11,033
They do. It. That's my job.

1615
01:06:14,783 --> 01:06:17,116
I'm waiting 2 seconds to smoke.

1616
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:17,716
It's.

1617
01:06:17,716 --> 01:06:18,733
It's mid

1618
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:20,866
I could wallet.

1619
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,050
Oh, I messed up.

1620
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,016
Right. OK,

1621
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,200
maybe only eight.

1622
01:06:28,216 --> 01:06:31,766
By the ultimate with go on.

1623
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:34,350
They're still going to have it.

1624
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,066
I think.

1625
01:06:39,983 --> 01:06:40,766
I hit them.

1626
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,783
Oh, my God.

1627
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,433
He's sitting there the entire time.

1628
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:47,600
This right. He's having a.

1629
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,650
Right spike down b.

1630
01:06:50,066 --> 01:06:51,233
Bracelet. 100 on the wall.

1631
01:06:51,233 --> 01:06:53,300
Heaven all.

1632
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:57,000
On site fade

1633
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,400
now. We're cooking and

1634
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,483
hunting.

1635
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:03,716
These guys have great game sense.

1636
01:07:03,716 --> 01:07:04,733
Oh, my God.

1637
01:07:05,483 --> 01:07:07,733

Is there respect on the ground?

1946
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:41,866
Nothing else.

All right, Lily,

We're both
both going to kick the wall on three, ok?

1971
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,100
One, two, three.

1972
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,350
I don't think I'm the oven alarm on this.

Oh, no. Oh.

Come on, man. OK.

1995
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,350
You know, I don't like giving false hope.

1996

We may or may not have this.

01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:05,566
we're not sure if we have this or not,
but it it's a 5050 on if we win or not.

2001
01:22:06,116 --> 01:22:08,700
Yeah. You either win or you don't win.

2002
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,400
You need a drop.

2003
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,450
Yeah. I'll take one of those.

2004
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:14,750
Things I have
I have an idea of how to get.

2005
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,966
What the hell.

2006
01:22:20,966 --> 01:22:22,366
They're all shooting at me. What?

2007
01:22:22,366 --> 01:22:24,750
That's crazy. And I'll be.

2008
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,416
Like three people are shooting at me.
All right.

2009
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:29,066
What's OK. I'm leaving. I just.

2010
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:30,616
Spoke

2011
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:32,966

2012
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:33,833
There.

2013
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:34,200
All right.

2014
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,266
Invents

2015
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:48,500
one jumps out, one comes out.

2016
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:53,300
Now what we're having.

2017
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,966
Style not oh.

2018
01:22:56,566 --> 01:22:58,100
Spike down B.

2019
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,350
Oh, shit. That player's standing.

2020
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:00,916
Like a shoe.

2021
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:01,966
You win these, you win these.

2022
01:23:01,966 --> 01:23:05,033
Right? 100

2023
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,650

2024
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,550
So, first.

2025
01:23:10,216 --> 01:23:11,816
Of all, you have a right, too.

2026
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:14,933
Nice. It's big. It's massive.

2027
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:17,116
There's one just on Ramon. No,

2028
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,766
you're telling me.

2029
01:23:20,766 --> 01:23:22,466
Oh, boy.

2030
01:23:22,466 --> 01:23:27,350

2031
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:31,616

2032
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:36,083
Oh, my God.

2033
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:36,416
Alvin.

2034
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,216
So sick.

2035
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh. All right.

2036
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,033
Got a go scar.

2037
01:23:44,033 --> 01:23:44,766
Yeah, I got you.

2038
01:23:44,766 --> 01:23:46,833
I got nothing.

2039
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:48,750
Did you. Buy scalloping?

2040
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:49,816
I care.

2041
01:23:53,233 --> 01:23:54,700
I've been the dream.

2042
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,483
Oh, I got a viper now.

2043
01:23:59,483 --> 01:24:03,300
Mm do we have a fifth to replace?

2044
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,916
There might be

2045
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,083
or or. Wow.

2046
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,883
Two people to replace

2047
01:24:15,466 --> 01:24:16,516
I think.

2048
01:24:16,516 --> 01:24:20,183
I think they're
not levelled enough for play ranked, but

2049
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,383
they would be down and play unrated

2050
01:24:24,383 --> 01:24:26,350
if you all are fine. Who.

2051
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,333
You keep.

2052
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,950
OK, ok.

2053
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:29,516
Yeah.

2054
01:24:29,516 --> 01:24:30,716
Dude, another purple boy.

2055
01:24:30,716 --> 01:24:31,666
Let's go

2056
01:24:33,266 --> 01:24:34,283
oh, shoot.

2057
01:24:35,266 --> 01:24:37,433
Are you still there.

2058
01:24:39,383 --> 01:24:41,650
Don? OK, you know, it's ok

2059
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,816
when he gets.

2060
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:47,400
Oh, shoot.

2061
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,266
Yells hit or cut off.

2062
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:50,483
Oh, my fucking way.

2063
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:52,166
My head's cut off.

2064
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,200
Yeah. You're like.

2065
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,050
Half.

2066
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:57,833
Half headed.

2067
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:03,683
To Shuki.

2068
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,366
Shoot, shoot.

2069
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:07,966
Kito.

2070
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:09,466
Suki kids.

2071
01:25:09,466 --> 01:25:10,366
Aaliyah

2072
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,700
ok, let me.

2073
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:22,516
I was this the the code for it.

2074
01:25:22,516 --> 01:25:24,266
OK, thank you.

2075
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:27,516
Use that later. OK?

2076
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:33,733
What I use the car may not then

2077
01:25:33,733 --> 01:25:36,533
just use you.

2078
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,083
Oh, yeah.

2079
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:41,216
Anything works.

2080
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,000
Or wiggly or wiggly.

2081
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,800
Form. Oh, yes. Yeah.

2082
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,683
I'm distracting them
when they try to look at the map.

2083
01:25:48,683 --> 01:25:50,000
Yeah, that's me.

2084
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,116
Mortgage
and try to cover it and the time come

2085
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,250
that.

2086
01:26:03,383 --> 01:26:06,050
Say send them the invite to the server.

2087
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:08,116
Or I think so. Yeah is ok. I'm going.

2088
01:26:09,016 --> 01:26:11,066
Oh yeah sure. OK.

2089
01:26:11,066 --> 01:26:12,683
I won't help me.

2090
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,866
And then that's
and then who do we have for fifth.

2091
01:26:16,016 --> 01:26:16,733
Do you know

2092
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,316
we have anyone. Else

2093
01:26:20,366 --> 01:26:29,516
not sure you see.

2094
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:34,100
We have four fifth oh.

2095
01:26:37,616 --> 01:26:39,650
What is, what is cycle no doing.

2096
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:40,366
I know he's busy.

2097
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:44,266
I think, I think yeah.

2098
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,400
If you could ask for more slot two.

2099
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,033
Anybody from anybody else from these
you wants to play.

2100
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:51,416
Yeah. Yeah.

2101
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:52,016
All right.

2102
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:55,366
Like I know
Fuller might be on on this time probably.

2103
01:26:55,433 --> 01:26:57,300
I'm not sure. Hello.

2104
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,100
Oh, hello. Key.

2105
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:02,400
What's up? Hi. Welcome. Welcome.

2106
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:04,883
Can you send me your food link,
by the way?

2107
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:07,100
Mine.

2108
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,900
Yeah, yours. OK,

2109
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,650
ok. Yeah.

2110
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:22,466
Is there.

2111
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:23,966
A show? Just DMA to you?

2112
01:27:23,966 --> 01:27:26,033
Yeah, just the to me. OK.

2113
01:27:30,533 --> 01:27:32,033
Hierarchy.

2114
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,316
Hi. Nice to meet you.

2115
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:35,100
Yeah.

2116
01:27:39,116 --> 01:27:41,150
I'm not good.

2117
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:43,816
I'm probably worse.

2118
01:27:43,816 --> 01:27:44,400
OK? I'm not.

2119
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,750
I'm not that good either.

2120
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:49,000
We're all I feel like you're gone.

2121
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:50,700
That's something.

2122
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,033
I mean, I feel like that's a mistake,
honestly.

2123
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,216
OK, I should know easier.

2124
01:27:55,216 --> 01:27:56,450
You know, you're pretty good.

2125
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,216
Yeah. You're Katie.

2126
01:27:58,216 --> 01:27:58,966
My Katie.

2127
01:27:58,966 --> 01:28:00,983
Was that mean? I'll kill death, right?

2128
01:28:00,983 --> 01:28:02,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2129
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:04,700
During
the first match, you're like 26 and 15.

2130
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,316
I really. I didn't notice. Yeah.

2131
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:09,900
Oh. GUMI might be down a chain.

2132
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:15,600
Puts both of you right here. OK,

2133
01:28:17,633 --> 01:28:18,600
here we go.

2134
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,566
So we're switching
to what's a unrated, right?

2135
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:32,566
OK, then if we switch on rhythm,
we don't need to worry about mouth

2136
01:28:32,566 --> 01:28:34,800
covering stuff. Oh, no. We can just, like,
have fun with it, right?

2137
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,600
Yeah, we could just. Yeah.

2138
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,616
I mean, we were we were.

2139
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:40,050
Already showing, to be honest, so.

2140
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:41,883
Yeah, pretty much.

2141
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:42,866
I'm going to the restroom real quick.

2142
01:28:43,816 --> 01:28:46,400
Okey dokey. OK.

2143
01:28:56,933 --> 01:29:02,116
Ok. Oh, anyways, so now I finally had
a chance to talk got to chat.

2144
01:29:02,116 --> 01:29:03,916
Are you guys doing what's up?

2145
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:04,500
I was, I was.

2146
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,333
I was up

2147
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,000
actually.

2148
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,666
Purple Voice.

2149
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,800
Yup. Or Voice Club finally. Right?

2150
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:12,150
It was gun.

2151
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:15,600
It was bound to happen eventually
because I really wanted to do something

2152
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,066
like that.

2153
01:29:16,066 --> 01:29:18,950
But yeah, today
I guess we got the chance, too, so

2154
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,250
that's pretty cool, right,

2155
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:23,333
guys? I'm not.

2156
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:24,983
I'm really not that good at Valentine's.

2157
01:29:24,983 --> 01:29:26,116
I don't know what you're talking about.

2158
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:29,400
Like, I feel like most of the time,
the first one,

2159
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,433
I think we're just really well
coordinated as a team.

2160
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,066
The second time around was kind of suss
knuckle.

2161
01:29:34,066 --> 01:29:38,633
I, I think they might
have actually been sniping.

2162
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:40,666
I don't know if that's true or not

2163
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:44,700
because I don't know much about violence
and like, people actually do.

2164
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,033
People really students like that
seems kind of sucky.

2165
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:48,083
So be honest.

2166
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,983
I feel like they wouldn't bite
because I guess I have like more v a.

2167
01:29:52,816 --> 01:29:55,116
I. Have more faith in people.

2168
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:57,616
I'll I'll come back. OK, we ready?

2169
01:29:58,766 --> 01:29:59,483
Yeah.

2170
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:00,383
Okeydoke.

2171
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,983
Let me leave the map.

2172
01:30:03,016 --> 01:30:04,800
Oh, warming up.

2173
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,933
Yeah.

2174
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:08,783
Well, all right.

2175
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:10,583
I haven't played since yesterday here.

2176
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:11,000
Or was that.

2177
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,716
Oh, you're.

2178
01:30:11,716 --> 01:30:12,066
Perfect.

2179
01:30:12,066 --> 01:30:14,850

They are so dead.

2556
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:07,950

Re that neon is kind of crazy.

2582

Yeah, she's running around
like she owns the place

2583
01:46:30,916 --> 01:46:32,366

2734
01:53:11,783 --> 01:53:14,566
I know. That the year time.

2735
01:53:14,566 --> 01:53:15,350
Yeah.

01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,783
Run in there some who's there.

Yeah. Yeah.

2738
01:53:18,533 --> 01:53:20,633
Big Josh doing your big balls. Yeah.

01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:34,733
Nice try.

2743
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,133
This. Sorry I freaked out. No.

2744
01:53:37,816 --> 01:53:39,983
You're getting there.

2745
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:41,550
That's Valerie.

2746
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,450
I love horror games.

2747
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,700
All right.

2748
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:50,100
Have you played Poppy's playtime?

2749
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:52,583
Oh, I fell for.

2750
01:53:52,616 --> 01:53:54,283
The first episode.

2751
01:53:54,316 --> 01:53:56,666
I'm going to emotionally support someone.

2752
01:53:56,866 --> 01:53:57,383
I played ball.

2753
01:53:58,466 --> 01:54:00,000
Yeah. I

2754
01:54:04,433 --> 01:54:06,650
do not like hugging swaggy.

2755
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:10,316
Oh. Are we going?

2756
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:12,083
Let's push a pushing.

01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,500
Just like Russian. OK.

2760
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:21,750
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2761
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:26,000
You can counter this site

2762
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:32,033
oh. This one's behind sand behind me.

2763
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:33,533
Oh, yeah.

2764
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:34,550
Oh, oh.

2765
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:36,900
I lost the fight sound

2766
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,000
now.And behind you guys.

2767
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,450
Watch out, watch out.

2768
01:54:41,966 --> 01:54:42,600
Oh, he killed her.

2769
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:45,000
Nice. Oh.

2770
01:54:46,316 --> 01:54:47,633
It was Omen doing.

2771
01:54:47,633 --> 01:54:51,233
Oh, he's on satellite. Oh,

2772
01:54:51,233 --> 01:54:52,200
all right.

2773
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:03,150
Oh. Lily, for better,
you're better than OK.

2774
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:04,950
You're better than really.

2775
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:08,716
Oh. Oh, my.

2776
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,200
Gosh. That sage.

2777
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:10,966
Yeah, sage.

2778
01:55:10,966 --> 01:55:13,016
The sheriff shots. Francine Yeah.

2779
01:55:13,166 --> 01:55:14,716
Actually, she. Said I.

2780
01:55:14,716 --> 01:55:15,866
Jinx it.

2781
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,816
Oh, my gosh.

2782
01:55:22,816 --> 01:55:23,450
Screams.

2783
01:55:24,466 --> 01:55:25,366
All right,

2784
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:28,133
well, a lot of that report.

2785
01:55:28,133 --> 01:55:29,816
What we do hear gamers, I don't know.

2786
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:34,366
The right thing to do is sit and.

2787
01:55:34,966 --> 01:55:37,100
Be responsible for money.

2788
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,616
Yes. And we're going to.
What's that? Yeah.

2789
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:40,816
Just go for a rush.

2790
01:55:40,816 --> 01:55:41,300
Yeah.

2791
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:45,983
Oh, he's going to the other side.

2792
01:55:47,266 --> 01:55:49,166
Follow this good workout, and you.

2793
01:55:49,166 --> 01:55:52,283
Even want to push off him
or anything or whatever.

2794
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:56,266
And they want you push first,
and then they'll

2795
01:55:56,266 --> 01:55:57,683
they'll see us, and then they'll rotate.

2796
01:55:57,683 --> 01:56:00,600
And then, I mean,
it would be a long shot, like, I think.

2797
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:02,550
Sake.

2798
01:56:03,866 --> 01:56:05,716
While we kill them.

2799
01:56:05,716 --> 01:56:08,616
And our aren't.

2800
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:11,900
Oh, man. Oh, he's going up there.

2801
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,883
All right, clear terrorism.

2802
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:15,700
It's clear.

2803
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,950
Right down.

2804
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:25,400
Be one less.

2805
01:56:28,283 --> 01:56:29,666
Nice plant.

2806
01:56:30,483 --> 01:56:32,700
Rees was like canteen.

2807
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:34,566
Oh, yeah. Oh, the.

2808
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,850
10, tag.

2809
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:39,750
Your eye tag is nice.

2810
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:42,883
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

2811
01:56:42,933 --> 01:56:44,933
Oh, my God. The eco. Yeah.

2812
01:56:44,933 --> 01:56:46,516
They didn't buy that round
for some reason.

2813
01:56:46,516 --> 01:56:49,200
What's this?
Strangers want me dead. Weird.

2814
01:56:49,716 --> 01:56:52,083
Yeah.
I always liked how you want that one.

2815
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:53,966
Let's go.

2816
01:56:53,966 --> 01:56:54,450
Let's go.

2817
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:54,783
It's OK.

2818
01:56:54,783 --> 01:56:55,083
It's OK.

2819
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:55,616
It'll

2820
01:56:59,966 --> 01:57:01,350
refrigerate.

2821
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:01,766
Oh, my God.

2822
01:57:01,766 --> 01:57:04,566
I just realised you have an exposed thigh,
Lily.

2823
01:57:05,183 --> 01:57:06,900
Like, I. Know it's a. Tie.

2824
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,583
Oh, my God. What's.

2825
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:11,166
Oh. And how long.

2826
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:14,016
Never noticed that.

2827
01:57:16,016 --> 01:57:17,166
Hug you for a second.

2828
01:57:17,166 --> 01:57:19,316
I thought it was something in game,
and I was like, wait. What

01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:25,166
Oh, wow.

2830

They found my. Trap. Me?

2832
01:57:38,733 --> 01:57:40,350
What is this woman doing?

2833
01:57:40,616 --> 01:57:41,850
They found my trap.

2834
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:42,866
Apparently.

2835
01:57:47,566 --> 01:57:50,816
Hey, I ii

She's on scene right now.

2843
01:58:17,366 --> 01:58:19,050
She might be coming through, Link.

2844
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:19,350
Oh, no.

2845
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:20,216
She's behind us.

2846
01:58:20,216 --> 01:58:22,083
Nice shot.

2847
01:58:23,583 --> 01:58:24,516
Clean. Clean.

I Yeah. I couldn't resist.

2851
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:34,116
When it came out.

2852
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:35,933
Oh, yeah. That's your skin.

2853
01:58:35,933 --> 01:58:36,633
The skin?

2854
01:58:36,633 --> 01:58:37,566
Yeah.

2855
01:58:40,266 --> 01:58:41,216
See, if you want a better gun,

2856
01:58:41,216 --> 01:58:44,400
I can buy you and me the ultrasound. OK?

2857

Thank you.

2858
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:47,533
Okay.

So did people say.

01:58:50,283 --> 01:58:52,033
So did. A good start.

2861
01:58:52,033 --> 01:58:54,183
You went. Behind.

01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:04,583
I'll go pick a gun on.

2866
01:59:04,766 --> 01:59:06,483
No one's there just yet.

2867
01:59:06,483 --> 01:59:08,250
Ah, look out.

Any good?

01:59:40,266 --> 01:59:40,983
I took a. Seat.

2880
01:59:40,983 --> 01:59:42,233
It's working. It's working.

2881
01:59:42,233 --> 01:59:43,983
All right, run it back.

2882
01:59:45,216 --> 01:59:47,400
It's took a worse gun for some reason.

01:59:47,933 --> 01:59:49,916
I think. Are these. These stronger?

2884

02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:33,766
Oh, my. God.

Could be.

2909

2915
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:58,783
I don't know what's happening.
This is a. Lot of people coming.

2916
02:01:00,183 --> 02:01:02,300
Oh, that's like.

2917
02:01:02,883 --> 02:01:03,716
Oh, nice try.

2918
02:01:03,716 --> 02:01:05,816
I won't be mean down.

2919
02:01:05,816 --> 02:01:06,816
Oh, no.

2920
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,583
Stop it. Stop it. It's.

2921
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:09,816
They are only near-sighted.

2922
02:01:09,816 --> 02:01:10,466
They got a stool.

2923
02:01:10,466 --> 02:01:13,066
Know your mind? Oh, no.

2924
02:01:13,866 --> 02:01:15,716
Forget about the sound.

2925
02:01:17,883 --> 02:01:18,483
Nice try.

2926
02:01:18,483 --> 02:01:19,683
Nice, right?

2927
02:01:19,683 --> 02:01:21,866
Isn't that sounds very spooky.

2928
02:01:21,866 --> 02:01:22,666
Isn't

2929
02:01:23,366 --> 02:01:25,133
that actually became a horror game?

2930
02:01:25,133 --> 02:01:26,550
They came from us from both angles.

2931
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:30,900
We were just looking each other dead,
holding hands, not going to do a sweating

2932
02:01:32,916 --> 02:01:33,666
problem.

2933
02:01:34,716 --> 02:01:34,950
Oh, yeah.

2934
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:37,050
We haven't tried from the other side
yet, have we?

2935
02:01:37,116 --> 02:01:39,216
You know, like pincer. A sight like a.

2936
02:01:39,366 --> 02:01:40,083
Yeah, let's do that.

2937
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:40,416
Okay, let's.

2938
02:01:40,416 --> 02:01:42,983
Go a yeah. OK,

2939
02:01:45,383 --> 02:01:46,633
a gift.

2940
02:01:48,233 --> 02:01:51,266
Neon likes to peek this so hot on

2941
02:01:51,266 --> 02:01:52,000
not there

2942
02:01:53,883 --> 02:01:56,716
Spike down. Oh,

2943
02:01:57,716 --> 02:02:00,633
Oh, I'm all

2944
02:02:00,633 --> 02:02:00,866
right.

2945
02:02:08,883 --> 02:02:09,950
It's not

2946
02:02:10,566 --> 02:02:11,166
all of them.

2947
02:02:12,916 --> 02:02:14,616
Ow, ow.

2948
02:02:14,616 --> 02:02:15,783
Ow, ow.

2949
02:02:15,783 --> 02:02:16,583
One enemy.

2950
02:02:16,583 --> 02:02:17,200
I didn't realise.

2951
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,266
Oh, guys, we were hogging what's.

2952
02:02:19,766 --> 02:02:20,250
Oh, wow.

2953
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:23,516
OK, we just need to Spike VI of

2954
02:02:23,516 --> 02:02:25,083
all neon dysplasia. Yeah, this is.

2955
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:25,800
She's not on the spike.

2956
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:28,316
She's on some Johnson. She's on sound.

2957
02:02:28,316 --> 02:02:28,866
Yeah.

2958
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:32,366
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2959
02:02:34,116 --> 02:02:37,116
I like watching Lily run out with.

2960
02:02:37,116 --> 02:02:38,333
The axe.

2961
02:02:38,333 --> 02:02:39,883
Immediately.

2962
02:02:40,283 --> 02:02:40,900
Yeah.

2963
02:02:42,233 --> 02:02:43,133
It's called.

2964
02:02:43,566 --> 02:02:45,633
She wants to ask them a question,
that's all.

2965
02:02:45,716 --> 02:02:46,383
Well.

2966
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:48,416
Yeah,

2967
02:02:50,133 --> 02:02:51,183
there are people.

2968
02:02:51,183 --> 02:02:53,783
People? People should try it again.

2969
02:02:54,083 --> 02:02:55,166
Yeah, let's do it again.

2970
02:02:55,166 --> 02:02:57,716
There's no way they expect it again,
right?

2971
02:02:57,716 --> 02:02:58,283
Oh, yeah.

2972
02:02:58,283 --> 02:03:00,300
Be, like, all because it works here.

2973
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:01,683
They're going to go be this time.

2974
02:03:01,683 --> 02:03:03,916
Try to, like, cripple psychology us.
But no.

2975
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:05,516
And you do the same side again.

2976
02:03:05,516 --> 02:03:07,166
They will look stupid once we're on there.

2977
02:03:07,166 --> 02:03:10,016
And watch this. Oh. Wait

2978
02:03:11,383 --> 02:03:12,800
to find you.

2979
02:03:14,066 --> 02:03:16,683
Oh, she has a fucking lying down.

2980
02:03:16,916 --> 02:03:18,083
OK, ok.

2981
02:03:18,083 --> 02:03:18,533
Let's go. Help.

2982
02:03:18,533 --> 02:03:19,883
Yeah, that was really rude.

2983
02:03:19,883 --> 02:03:23,466
I didn't think that was going to happen.

2984
02:03:23,466 --> 02:03:24,083
One 17th.

2985
02:03:24,083 --> 02:03:25,500
I think I know it.

2986
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,233
OK, where you. Are.

2987
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:29,283
Do you have rows oh, yeah.

2988
02:03:29,283 --> 02:03:33,183
I think all the bodies are

2989
02:03:34,266 --> 02:03:37,850
it's kind of risky to rotate

2990
02:03:38,466 --> 02:03:38,666
yeah.

2991
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:41,300
Let me try to get the ball on. Be

2992
02:03:42,933 --> 02:03:44,783
you know, you have a minute still.

2993
02:03:44,783 --> 02:03:45,833
OK? OK.

2994
02:03:45,833 --> 02:03:46,616
Oh, ok.

2995
02:03:46,616 --> 02:03:47,400
Well.

2996
02:03:50,216 --> 02:03:53,333
Assuming the inverted already. OK.

2997
02:03:54,416 --> 02:03:56,216
I'll find you

2998
02:03:57,116 --> 02:03:57,666
anyway.

2999
02:03:58,016 --> 02:04:00,600
No, no. Oh,

3000
02:04:02,516 --> 02:04:03,516
oh, no.

3001
02:04:03,516 --> 02:04:05,133
And see. Hot.

3002
02:04:05,966 --> 02:04:07,350
Oh, shit.

3003
02:04:08,966 --> 02:04:11,133
But they're everywhere.

3004
02:04:11,633 --> 02:04:12,866
I panic.

3005
02:04:12,866 --> 02:04:14,550
OK, which gun to pick?

3006
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:17,366
I think a couple of them
are just hiding on B

3007
02:04:17,366 --> 02:04:18,383
probably. Yeah.

3008
02:04:18,383 --> 02:04:19,466
I think so.

3009
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:22,533
Does anyone have fun?

3010
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:26,116
Ooh. Guns, money? Yes.

3011
02:04:26,633 --> 02:04:28,916
Miss Nancy.

3012
02:04:31,650 --> 02:04:33,183
Uh, let's try B.

3013
02:04:33,183 --> 02:04:35,100
Yeah, he's been working for us, right?

3014
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:36,333
So. Yeah.

3015
02:04:36,333 --> 02:04:39,333
Yeah, ok.

3016
02:04:47,716 --> 02:04:49,716
Oh. I'm all right.

3017
02:04:49,716 --> 02:04:50,616
I'm off.

3018
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:53,283
Oh, could I buy wolves?

3019
02:04:53,283 --> 02:04:54,716
The wolves are coming.

3020
02:04:56,133 --> 02:04:57,366
Oh, fine.

3021
02:04:57,366 --> 02:04:58,733
OK, maybe. Gang.

3022
02:04:59,016 --> 02:05:00,066
Gang.

3023
02:05:00,066 --> 02:05:01,266
Oh, my God.

3024
02:05:02,333 --> 02:05:05,283
The on flanks are so fast.

3025
02:05:05,283 --> 02:05:08,250
She's so quick.

3026
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,750
Nice.

3027
02:05:14,733 --> 02:05:17,366
Oh, try.

3028
02:05:19,266 --> 02:05:20,250
Oh, she's reloading.

3029
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,750
He's got the sound.

3030
02:05:24,083 --> 02:05:24,983
Oh, interesting.

3031
02:05:24,983 --> 02:05:27,633
Oh, I. Saw what he was going there
for. I like.

3032
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:28,566
I like it sounds.

3033
02:05:28,566 --> 02:05:32,066
I can respect it. Mm.

3034
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:33,666
If resisting a good position for that

3035
02:05:33,666 --> 02:05:36,166
there. Hmm.

3036
02:05:40,166 --> 02:05:43,350
OK, we buy him for.

3037
02:05:43,566 --> 02:05:44,216
Yeah.

3038
02:05:44,783 --> 02:05:49,650
Yeah, I'm for I'm poor,
but I could buy a guardian but I'm poor.

3039
02:05:49,716 --> 02:05:50,283
I'm serious.

3040
02:05:50,283 --> 02:05:52,316
My life is secure.

3041
02:05:53,633 --> 02:05:53,850
Yeah.

3042
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,233
Maybe I'll share

3043
02:05:56,583 --> 02:05:57,666
for you.

3044
02:05:57,816 --> 02:06:00,083
Let's try to see if we can win our fight.

3045
02:06:01,583 --> 02:06:03,516
Ok? Yeah.

3046
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,600
We are. Yes.

3047
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,833
I mean,

3048
02:06:13,083 --> 02:06:15,600
what's that? OK.

3049
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:18,216
Face your fear.

3050
02:06:18,216 --> 02:06:19,533
I know

3051
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:23,250
hard oh.

3052
02:06:23,316 --> 02:06:24,750
Oh, my God.

3053
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:25,616
Spike down.

3054
02:06:25,616 --> 02:06:27,533
Attack. Respond.

3055
02:06:28,316 --> 02:06:29,550
Oh. Oops.

3056
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:30,033
Oops.

3057
02:06:31,716 --> 02:06:34,283
Now you.

3058
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,416
Yeah. Oh, man.

3059
02:06:37,416 --> 02:06:39,033
And you're ready to go there.

3060
02:06:39,033 --> 02:06:40,083
Introduce

3061
02:06:42,966 --> 02:06:45,533
uh, I mean, what type of dish

3062
02:06:46,883 --> 02:06:47,316
or not?

3063
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:52,566
A cipher I'm.

3064
02:06:57,033 --> 02:06:57,300
Zales.

3065
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:58,133
They are.

3066
02:07:01,983 --> 02:07:03,383
Nice.

3067
02:07:03,383 --> 02:07:04,533
This Blake

3068
02:07:06,983 --> 02:07:07,533
you don't need this.

3069
02:07:07,533 --> 02:07:08,516
Like, if you kill them, they'll.

3070
02:07:08,516 --> 02:07:10,116
So that's true.

3071
02:07:10,116 --> 02:07:11,633
True what you will with that did for me.

3072
02:07:11,633 --> 02:07:14,400
30 seconds left. No,

3073
02:07:23,183 --> 02:07:25,916
oh, nice.

3074
02:07:27,816 --> 02:07:29,783
OK, all you have to.

3075
02:07:29,783 --> 02:07:31,283
Oh, God.

3076
02:07:31,566 --> 02:07:33,666
10 seconds left.

3077
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:36,883
Oh, no.

3078
02:07:36,883 --> 02:07:40,083
Oh. I'm sorry.

3079
02:07:40,116 --> 02:07:43,233
I try. Nice try.

3080
02:07:43,233 --> 02:07:44,483
I surrender.

3081
02:07:44,483 --> 02:07:46,283
We don't need surrender.

3082
02:07:46,583 --> 02:07:47,850
You win this.

3083
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,783
Yes. Never surrender.

3084
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:56,783
All right.

3085
02:07:59,466 --> 02:08:00,483
A gift

3086
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:05,633
all right, now let's try b b,

3087
02:08:07,116 --> 02:08:07,966
yeah.

3088
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:09,066
I like B.

3089
02:08:09,066 --> 02:08:11,333
These B's pretty sexy until.

3090
02:08:12,666 --> 02:08:14,516
Cover going up.

3091
02:08:14,733 --> 02:08:15,900
Oh, my God.

3092
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:16,566
Oh, my God.

3093
02:08:16,566 --> 02:08:19,500
She's crazy. Yeah.

3094
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:22,533
Yeah, I think Neon always tries to go for
the Insta is the flag.

3095
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,316
They win.

3096
02:08:24,366 --> 02:08:27,666
And this time the LA Times did.

3097
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:31,950
A song is behind us then. Oh,

3098
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:34,133
they did.

3099
02:08:34,983 --> 02:08:36,833
I'll show

3100
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:38,616
for you.

3101
02:08:38,816 --> 02:08:41,316
One enemy remaining.

3102
02:08:43,116 --> 02:08:44,433
For Sephora,

3103
02:08:45,366 --> 02:08:46,716
maybe. Okay.

3104
02:08:46,733 --> 02:08:48,716
Yeah, I'll plant. No.

3105
02:08:55,416 --> 02:08:56,066
Well.

3106
02:08:57,183 --> 02:08:57,666
What am I doing?

3107
02:08:57,666 --> 02:09:03,383
All mm

3108
02:09:06,716 --> 02:09:07,183
cross.

3109
02:09:07,416 --> 02:09:07,950
Fire.

3110
02:09:09,683 --> 02:09:10,583
I'm scared.

3111
02:09:11,316 --> 02:09:18,300
I home is making me dizzy.

3112
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,366
Oh. One Tony

3113
02:09:25,716 --> 02:09:26,933
Oh, my God.

3114
02:09:26,933 --> 02:09:29,666
Oh. And on one on one, you have to.

3115
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:31,466
Always go for a knife.

3116
02:09:32,466 --> 02:09:33,566
Like that.

3117
02:09:33,566 --> 02:09:35,166
He always gets it.

3118
02:09:35,166 --> 02:09:36,316
Oh, my God. This is.

3119
02:09:36,316 --> 02:09:37,283
It's crazy.

3120
02:09:37,283 --> 02:09:37,983
I like it.

3121
02:09:37,983 --> 02:09:40,650
Okay. OK.

3122
02:09:41,183 --> 02:09:43,900
Oh, my God. I love this guy.

3123
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:46,283
Oh, oh, man.

3124
02:09:46,283 --> 02:09:47,316
That was funny as fuck.

3125
02:09:51,183 --> 02:09:53,700
The enemy seems calling him mommy.

3126
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,266
Oh, really?

3127
02:09:54,266 --> 02:09:56,250
Yeah. Oh.

3128
02:10:00,533 --> 02:10:03,033
I'm gonna stay here to make him
think we're all going to come this way.

3129
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:04,450
I can walk.

3130
02:10:05,183 --> 02:10:07,116
OK? OK.

3131
02:10:07,783 --> 02:10:09,933
Then we set satellite.

3132
02:10:09,933 --> 02:10:10,516
Yeah.

3133
02:10:10,716 --> 02:10:13,416
So for this part one.

3134
02:10:13,416 --> 02:10:15,750
To the to to decipher.

3135
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,883
Yeah,

3136
02:10:17,583 --> 02:10:18,716
we're not this time.

3137
02:10:19,383 --> 02:10:23,816
OK, about ok.

3138
02:10:28,233 --> 02:10:34,300
Catching mm.

3139
02:10:35,616 --> 02:10:36,300
Oh, oh.

3140
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:38,766
In a way, little hamster

3141
02:10:40,116 --> 02:10:40,533
sorry.

3142
02:10:40,533 --> 02:10:42,383
You're not here. Oh, wait. OK.

3143
02:10:42,383 --> 02:10:43,533
They flanking.

3144
02:10:46,116 --> 02:10:48,000
Oh. Oh, we got to pick a link.

3145
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:48,533
We could go.

3146
02:10:48,533 --> 02:10:49,466
Oh, let's go, let's go.

3147
02:10:49,466 --> 02:10:51,666
Oh, oh.

3148
02:10:52,116 --> 02:10:54,216
They rotate off b, though.

3149
02:10:55,366 --> 02:10:56,383
They check.

3150
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:59,400
Oh, I see an assassin spike down.

3151
02:11:00,183 --> 02:11:03,783
Oh, there's two on say all right, team.

3152
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:04,683
We had three a.

3153
02:11:04,683 --> 02:11:06,733
I know exactly where you are.

3154
02:11:06,816 --> 02:11:09,866
No, you don't oh.

3155
02:11:13,016 --> 02:11:13,616
Nice.

3156
02:11:15,216 --> 02:11:15,683
I got

3157
02:11:18,033 --> 02:11:20,183
30 seconds left.

3158
02:11:26,516 --> 02:11:27,750
Oh my God.

3159
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:28,483
I know.

3160
02:11:28,583 --> 02:11:29,816
I was like they're on map.

3161
02:11:29,816 --> 02:11:32,483
Oh shit. Oh.

3162
02:11:33,116 --> 02:11:35,133
Oh I was looking at the map. It's

3163
02:11:39,383 --> 02:11:40,416
match point.

3164
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:42,600
My bad. Remember. All right.

3165
02:11:43,183 --> 02:11:45,216
We're only forcing.

3166
02:11:45,216 --> 02:11:45,933
What do we do?

3167
02:11:45,933 --> 02:11:46,466
What do we do.

3168
02:11:46,466 --> 02:11:46,916
What's the play.

3169
02:11:46,916 --> 02:11:49,116
Gamers play better.

3170
02:11:50,766 --> 02:11:51,066
Yeah.

3171
02:11:51,366 --> 02:11:53,133
We do, right?

3172
02:11:53,133 --> 02:11:55,283
Yeah. Come on, people.

3173
02:11:55,283 --> 02:11:55,816
Yeah.

3174
02:11:57,266 --> 02:11:58,666
You better, Fred.

3175
02:11:58,666 --> 02:12:00,250
Yeah, let's do it.

3176
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,216
Just tap their heads.

3177
02:12:02,466 --> 02:12:03,116
Nice room.

3178
02:12:03,116 --> 02:12:05,216
Let's just you guys rush B from that side.

3179
02:12:05,216 --> 02:12:08,700
I'll rush rugby from the side
and see what happens, OK? Oh.

3180
02:12:11,066 --> 02:12:14,466
Oh, oh, she got me

3181
02:12:16,733 --> 02:12:17,466
shadow.

3182
02:12:17,466 --> 02:12:18,900
That's awkward.

3183
02:12:26,216 --> 02:12:27,033
Oh, the

3184
02:12:27,583 --> 02:12:33,883
the slow or arcade oh.

3185
02:12:34,716 --> 02:12:35,733
Oh, my God.

3186
02:12:35,733 --> 02:12:36,750
Oh, my God.

3187
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:46,633
Oh, lava.

3188
02:12:47,316 --> 02:12:48,333
No way.

3189
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:52,233
Oh, roger.

3190
02:12:56,033 --> 02:12:59,300
Defender, if you.

3191
02:12:59,733 --> 02:13:02,733
You're, like, presenting yourself. It.

3192
02:13:02,733 --> 02:13:03,300
Take me

3193
02:13:05,483 --> 02:13:05,833
just let

3194
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:08,700
me just get me out of the device.

3195
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:10,800
OK? Like this.

3196
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,900
I get closer

3197
02:13:15,116 --> 02:13:17,833
maybe if I get closer, it'll hit me.

3198
02:13:17,850 --> 02:13:18,566
Yeah.

3199
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:19,316
How's it?

3200
02:13:19,316 --> 02:13:21,566
Good. Try it.

3201
02:13:22,233 --> 02:13:23,250
All right.

3202
02:13:23,466 --> 02:13:24,933
Let's see if we're still there.

3203
02:13:24,933 --> 02:13:26,733
Yeah, OK.

3204
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:29,766
Um, know water break.

3205
02:13:29,766 --> 02:13:32,183
OK, one more game for me.

3206
02:13:32,916 --> 02:13:33,966
OK? OK, that sounds fun.

3207
02:13:33,966 --> 02:13:36,283
OK, we better win.

3208
02:13:36,283 --> 02:13:36,700
Yeah.

3209
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,100
And then our losses.

3210
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,350
Have been lost.

3211
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:44,933
All right.

3212
02:13:44,933 --> 02:13:47,700
Oh, hey, what's up? It's me again.

3213
02:13:47,916 --> 02:13:51,716
I muted myself
so I can talk to you real quick. Wow.

3214
02:13:52,533 --> 02:13:53,466
Those are good games.

3215
02:13:53,466 --> 02:13:55,050
Those are really good games.

3216
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:57,233
What? Man, like you're so close.

3217
02:13:57,233 --> 02:14:00,033
Hey, fracture did fracture
such a weird map.

3218
02:14:00,033 --> 02:14:02,616
For me to play on.
Sometimes I feel like I'm getting it.

3219
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,833
I think I'll get some water to leave you.

3220
02:14:04,833 --> 02:14:07,050
Okeydokey, take your time. Oh, hello.

3221
02:14:07,733 --> 02:14:09,116
Hello? Hello. Hi.

3222
02:14:09,116 --> 02:14:11,133
Is that you? Folder?

3223
02:14:11,133 --> 02:14:13,200
Yo, what up so tall. Hello.

3224
02:14:13,416 --> 02:14:14,583
It would be good to play Valla again.

3225
02:14:14,583 --> 02:14:17,100
What? Can you send me your fuji, actually.

3226
02:14:17,783 --> 02:14:18,933
Oh, sure.

3227
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:21,383
Thank you. You know it. You

3228
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,650
oh, man.

3229
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:33,033
Only nominal, man.

3230
02:14:33,033 --> 02:14:35,400
Hi. Nice to meet you. Amongst
fun. Popinjay.

3231
02:14:35,466 --> 02:14:36,266
Nice to meet you.

3232
02:14:36,266 --> 02:14:38,383
I'm. I'm Fall Grove, and I.

3233
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,883
Just thought I stock all of your twitters.

3234
02:14:41,216 --> 02:14:42,616
Oh, like.

3235
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:44,883
What did you, like, profile us?

3236
02:14:44,883 --> 02:14:45,666
You like, under?

3237
02:14:45,666 --> 02:14:46,200
No, no, no.

3238
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,550
The in and outs of what we do every day.

3239
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:49,766
Know where we live aren't at the school.

3240
02:14:49,766 --> 02:14:51,233
We go to our wives.

3241
02:14:51,233 --> 02:14:54,033
Our children. You are, you know.

3242
02:14:54,033 --> 02:14:56,483
A big boy.

3243
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:00,483
I love being to the.

3244
02:15:00,516 --> 02:15:01,200
Same.

3245
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,566
I wish I was 20 right now.

3246
02:15:04,266 --> 02:15:05,583
If only.

3247
02:15:07,983 --> 02:15:09,416
I think being.

3248
02:15:09,416 --> 02:15:11,550
Around all the tattoos.

3249
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:12,833
Huh? Lila sorry.

3250
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:15,083
What tattoos?

3251
02:15:15,083 --> 02:15:17,183
Oh, know, this is the new me. I'm.

3252
02:15:17,366 --> 02:15:20,016
I'm just, you know, no one understands me.

3253
02:15:20,016 --> 02:15:20,700
You know.

3254
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,116
No one understands me.

3255
02:15:22,116 --> 02:15:22,833
God, I.

3256
02:15:22,833 --> 02:15:25,400
Feel that there's a demon
sealed in this arm.

3257
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,633
Exactly.

3258
02:15:27,633 --> 02:15:29,883
It's not a phase. It's not a phase.

3259
02:15:29,883 --> 02:15:32,383
My mom, the lifestyle.

3260
02:15:32,383 --> 02:15:35,700
I mean, I used to unironically
really love hot topic.

3261
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:38,400
I still unironically love hop.

3262
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,066
Told me, too. But as you. Should.

3263
02:15:41,966 --> 02:15:43,200
Know, no, I wasn't getting angry.

3264
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:46,083
It was just like, that's me. Now.

3265
02:15:46,083 --> 02:15:47,766
That's cool. Stuff like that.

3266
02:15:47,766 --> 02:15:49,616
Some cool t shirts once in a while.

3267
02:15:49,616 --> 02:15:52,800
And this is a safe space.

3268
02:15:53,216 --> 02:15:56,400
Like, nice chokers and little knickknacks.

3269
02:15:58,133 --> 02:16:00,183
Are we ready for this tour?

3270
02:16:00,183 --> 02:16:01,800
Oh, hell, yeah. Oh.

3271
02:16:01,983 --> 02:16:02,250
Yeah.

3272
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:04,566
Invites are for genuine sorry.

3273
02:16:05,483 --> 02:16:06,150
My man.

3274
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:08,783
How do I do, you guys?

3275
02:16:08,783 --> 02:16:11,633
Oh, I, uh.

3276
02:16:11,633 --> 02:16:14,183
I have to. Or from in.

3277
02:16:14,183 --> 02:16:15,866
Somehow, I saw an addict.

3278
02:16:15,866 --> 02:16:17,966
Oh, I'm still level 16.

3279
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,183
You can just right click
me and do an invite.

3280
02:16:21,383 --> 02:16:23,166
Oh, do you have, I guess. Yeah.

3281
02:16:23,166 --> 02:16:24,483
Make sure automatically I need.

3282
02:16:24,483 --> 02:16:26,366
You as a friend just to come. Across you.

3283
02:16:26,366 --> 02:16:27,833
Your fortune is so shiny.

3284
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,733
Yeah.

3285
02:16:29,733 --> 02:16:31,766
Yeah, yeah. Everybody's good to go.

3286
02:16:32,283 --> 02:16:33,666
Let's pop heads.

3287
02:16:33,833 --> 02:16:35,316
All right. We're a squad of five now.

3288
02:16:35,316 --> 02:16:36,383
We can't lose.

3289
02:16:36,383 --> 02:16:37,833
We have to win this.

3290
02:16:37,833 --> 02:16:40,283
Yes, but I don't want to lay 13 of them
or anything.

3291
02:16:40,283 --> 02:16:41,966
I want it at least like that.

3292
02:16:41,966 --> 02:16:43,983
Yeah. Yeah, like a fight. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

3293
02:16:43,983 --> 02:16:45,300
We could a fight.

3294
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:48,716
Remember that one card game where we want,
like, 30 rounds?

3295
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,133
I just.

3296
02:16:50,133 --> 02:16:51,516
Oh, I wanted to die.

3297
02:16:51,516 --> 02:16:53,066
I was, like, in over an hour.

3298
02:16:53,066 --> 02:16:56,033
It was me. You, Michael sounds awful. Oh.

3299
02:16:56,666 --> 02:16:58,283
It went on. For we had two.

3300
02:16:58,283 --> 02:17:02,166
Games like that back there, like,
just so many rounds

3301
02:17:02,283 --> 02:17:04,566
oh, I never had that happen before.

3302
02:17:05,583 --> 02:17:07,533
Those games are only fun if you windle.

3303
02:17:07,533 --> 02:17:08,850
Yeah, yeah.

3304
02:17:08,916 --> 02:17:11,400
Oh, yeah. You feel that I'm wasted.

3305
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,216
Yeah, yeah.

3306
02:17:12,216 --> 02:17:15,833
Uh oh, yeah.

3307
02:17:15,866 --> 02:17:18,866
But when you win, you feel like
a goddamn champion at the end of an arc.

3308
02:17:19,316 --> 02:17:20,316
Uh huh.

3309
02:17:20,316 --> 02:17:23,100
Let's go tell champion I like him.

3310
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:25,116
Yeah, I like his.
I like the way you say Arctic.

3311
02:17:25,116 --> 02:17:25,733
You say it again.

3312
02:17:25,733 --> 02:17:27,866
I'm March.

3313
02:17:27,866 --> 02:17:30,566
Yeah, Arctic Walk.

3314
02:17:30,566 --> 02:17:31,683
I'm not half. British.

3315
02:17:31,683 --> 02:17:34,716
I've slowly lost my British accent,
so I've got a weird accent. No.

3316
02:17:35,183 --> 02:17:36,366
No, it's really cool.

3317
02:17:36,366 --> 02:17:37,800
I wanted to finish high school.

3318
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,233
Oh, God. Do it, do it, do it.

3319
02:17:40,616 --> 02:17:41,133
Do it, do it.

3320
02:17:41,133 --> 02:17:42,033
Do it. Yeah.

3321
02:17:43,266 --> 02:17:45,183
So, are we ready for this?

3322
02:17:45,183 --> 02:17:46,916
So guide. Us.

3323
02:17:47,466 --> 02:17:48,516
OK, you know what? I'm doing.

3324
02:17:48,516 --> 02:17:50,400
Good. It's getting there, getting there,
getting there, going. Good.

3325
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:51,416
But you pay me for the basics.

3326
02:17:51,416 --> 02:17:54,300
Just hit me with the Volvo.

3327
02:17:55,466 --> 02:17:58,416
Oh. Did you want to go for some?

3328
02:17:58,716 --> 02:18:02,633
Is that the same Maccas Australia?

3329
02:18:02,966 --> 02:18:03,416
I thought that's.

3330
02:18:03,416 --> 02:18:05,666
Yeah, not Australian.

3331
02:18:06,983 --> 02:18:08,183
All the time.

3332
02:18:08,316 --> 02:18:10,716
Oh. These Mickey D's.

3333
02:18:10,716 --> 02:18:13,716
Oh, the kids.
Get some Mickey D's brothers.

3334
02:18:13,716 --> 02:18:15,283
Yeah, yeah. For them.

3335
02:18:15,283 --> 02:18:17,466
Rough eat jellied eels.

3336
02:18:17,466 --> 02:18:18,866
What is jellied eels?

3337
02:18:18,866 --> 02:18:21,666
Are we talking in British accents
now for the rest of the stream?

3338
02:18:22,733 --> 02:18:23,183
I mean.

3339
02:18:23,183 --> 02:18:24,416
That sounds really fun.

3340
02:18:24,416 --> 02:18:26,933
I'm down for that. Oh, yeah.

3341
02:18:26,933 --> 02:18:28,233
Look, it doesn't have to do anything.

3342
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:29,183
Yeah, I've always just.

3343
02:18:29,183 --> 02:18:33,816
Just insists and talks to them again.

3344
02:18:33,833 --> 02:18:35,216
If you speak another language.

3345
02:18:36,366 --> 02:18:38,100
I came in some

3346
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,266
Vietnamese a bit, but that's on.

3347
02:18:42,066 --> 02:18:42,533
I don't really.

3348
02:18:42,533 --> 02:18:46,283
I'm bilingual
with the English and Japanese

3349
02:18:48,266 --> 02:18:48,600
yeah.

3350
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,566
I've got like basic comprehension
of Spanish and Japanese.

3351
02:18:52,383 --> 02:18:57,033
And Spanish in high school, just like,
yeah, I don't remember too much now, but.

3352
02:18:57,466 --> 02:18:59,766
One day I start to bibliotheque.
Of course.

3353
02:19:00,116 --> 02:19:03,783
You know, I like,
I like Plato, Il Bologna as well.

3354
02:19:05,316 --> 02:19:07,216
That one's really handy

3355
02:19:09,283 --> 02:19:14,133
now. Not be in. C c.

3356
02:19:14,366 --> 02:19:15,783
I want to try

3357
02:19:17,633 --> 02:19:18,333
them.

3358
02:19:18,333 --> 02:19:20,933
My favourite word
right now is like real Torah.

3359
02:19:21,083 --> 02:19:22,950
I don't know, it just sounds so nice.

3360
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:24,566
Oh, I love that.

3361
02:19:25,050 --> 02:19:26,933
Because Raina says. It.

3362
02:19:26,933 --> 02:19:27,633
That's you.

3363
02:19:27,633 --> 02:19:28,716
And I don't know, I just.

3364
02:19:28,716 --> 02:19:29,483
You're people.

3365
02:19:29,483 --> 02:19:30,666
It's a meme or something.

3366
02:19:30,666 --> 02:19:31,316
I'm not sure what.

3367
02:19:31,316 --> 02:19:33,816
Yeah, it's a mean kind of wild.

3368
02:19:33,816 --> 02:19:36,150
And especially if they're like,
small, incised.

3369
02:19:36,416 --> 02:19:37,466
Like Torah

3370
02:19:41,066 --> 02:19:43,500
I speak survival Asian languages.

3371
02:19:44,733 --> 02:19:46,733
Oh, Bible each way, right?

3372
02:19:46,733 --> 02:19:48,983
Yeah. A survival level, like.

3373
02:19:49,233 --> 02:19:50,666
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

3374
02:19:50,666 --> 02:19:51,750
When you visit.

3375
02:19:51,866 --> 02:19:54,633
A. Toilet with a scarf.

3376
02:19:54,633 --> 02:19:57,850
Oh. That's a good there.

3377
02:19:58,283 --> 02:19:59,333
That's. Yes.

3378
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,333
Imagine that.

3379
02:20:01,333 --> 02:20:02,566
You know.

3380
02:20:02,566 --> 02:20:05,333
It comes harmony the all comes.

3381
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:06,500
I know.

3382
02:20:06,616 --> 02:20:09,416
Imagine when they ask for the restroom
and then they give you, like,

3383
02:20:09,416 --> 02:20:11,633
the most complicated directions.
Oh, yeah, right.

3384
02:20:11,633 --> 02:20:12,716
The reply the only.

3385
02:20:12,716 --> 02:20:15,483
One I know is Rama on local. Got it.

3386
02:20:15,666 --> 02:20:16,433
That's it.

3387
02:20:16,916 --> 02:20:19,283
Oh, is it is it that far.

3388
02:20:19,283 --> 02:20:21,416
From the on the got it.

3389
02:20:21,416 --> 02:20:22,916
The equivalent in Netflix and chill.

3390
02:20:22,916 --> 02:20:25,100
Yes it is. Yeah, yeah.

3391
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:25,350
Yeah.

3392
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:26,983
It's just like,
hey, come over and you remember

3393
02:20:26,983 --> 02:20:29,050
you just really want to fuck I think. Oh.

3394
02:20:29,050 --> 02:20:32,250
Oh rolling it sounds way better than.

3395
02:20:32,483 --> 02:20:33,383
Ramen and hot and.

3396
02:20:34,566 --> 02:20:36,750
Everything and sounds like a good.

3397
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,350
Friday.

3398
02:20:37,366 --> 02:20:41,750
You think that's kind of
well the prices are going up

3399
02:20:42,066 --> 02:20:44,216
and they're selling
sometimes it's not the best.

3400
02:20:44,516 --> 02:20:46,533
And they have way less original content
nowadays.

3401
02:20:46,533 --> 02:20:47,483
Yeah,

3402
02:20:48,483 --> 02:20:52,133
that's after my own car.

3403
02:20:53,916 --> 02:20:54,633
I'll go.

3404
02:20:54,633 --> 02:20:57,333
Yeah, I'll set up one a.

3405
02:20:58,566 --> 02:20:59,433
I'm just going to see

3406
02:20:59,433 --> 02:21:01,533
if I can mess with people at all.

3407
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:05,516
Oh, so they're watching me.

3408
02:21:06,033 --> 02:21:06,716
Yeah. Watch me.

3409
02:21:06,716 --> 02:21:08,133
I got some.

3410
02:21:08,133 --> 02:21:09,266
Oh, what's it called?

3411
02:21:09,266 --> 02:21:09,933
Amy's good.

3412
02:21:09,933 --> 02:21:13,583
Ilona, I thought,
do you want me to come up the

3413
02:21:13,883 --> 02:21:14,516
I think.

3414
02:21:14,516 --> 02:21:17,666
Yeah, I come over here, they nerf me
as a sentinel, so I kind of suck now.

3415
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:20,333
Oh, there.

3416
02:21:20,333 --> 02:21:22,966
Said she's got he got nerf oil.

3417
02:21:23,333 --> 02:21:24,900
Quite a bit. What they do to him.

3418
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:29,950
They took away my trademark, my
other trademark charge and something else.

3419
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:30,366
And forget

3420
02:21:32,766 --> 02:21:35,300
oh e be ok.

3421
02:21:36,966 --> 02:21:38,100
Oh shit.

3422
02:21:40,366 --> 02:21:42,733
Doesn't look like any came through.

3423
02:21:43,166 --> 02:21:43,916
My walls going down.

3424
02:21:43,916 --> 02:21:44,283
Oh, wait.

3425
02:21:44,283 --> 02:21:46,966
As long as heaven on.

3426
02:21:48,466 --> 02:21:50,483
No no shit the.

3427
02:21:50,483 --> 02:21:51,683
Insight.

3428
02:21:51,683 --> 02:21:54,483
Oh, there's some mean there's some man I.

3429
02:21:54,483 --> 02:21:55,383
Went back.

3430
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:58,166
To saw one on the aisle.

3431
02:21:58,166 --> 02:22:00,833
She's like 55. You got it, got it.

3432
02:22:00,833 --> 02:22:02,700
Rayna's trapped in there

3433
02:22:02,966 --> 02:22:03,983
waiting garage.

3434
02:22:03,983 --> 02:22:04,350
Yeah.

3435
02:22:04,433 --> 02:22:08,250
Crash corner oh my God.

3436
02:22:09,216 --> 02:22:10,200
She's fucking. Kill killing.

3437
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:12,866
Nice, nice.

3438
02:22:13,716 --> 02:22:16,533
Yo you two, you had the same idea.

3439
02:22:17,416 --> 02:22:18,916
No, we rushed at the same time.

3440
02:22:18,916 --> 02:22:20,400
Yeah.

3441
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:22,866
So some, like, cartoon shit a virus.

3442
02:22:22,866 --> 02:22:23,466
You know what?

3443
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:24,566
Yeah.

3444
02:22:24,566 --> 02:22:26,516
You know that meme of, like,
the characters

3445
02:22:26,516 --> 02:22:28,316
looking at each other
and all the sides of the call?

3446
02:22:28,316 --> 02:22:28,983
That was exactly.

3447
02:22:28,983 --> 02:22:31,500
That was like. Wait a minute.

3448
02:22:31,983 --> 02:22:34,316
Lily, I'm manifesting your frag outs.

3449
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,066
Oh, for this game.

3450
02:22:36,066 --> 02:22:38,883
Let's go to your audience. Apparently.

3451
02:22:39,833 --> 02:22:40,950
Yeah, this is our best.

3452
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:43,650
Yeah, I think. Focus now is off me.

3453
02:22:44,033 --> 02:22:45,983
That's a good start.

3454
02:22:49,133 --> 02:22:52,116
You know, one thing nice.

3455
02:22:54,366 --> 02:22:56,433
One time it was a jet

3456
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:00,683
know. Oh.

3457
02:23:00,683 --> 02:23:03,183
You're coming through Gates, man.

3458
02:23:03,183 --> 02:23:05,283

02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:27,233
Big rocket.

3825
02:38:27,233 --> 02:38:30,116
OK, they had to OK, shoo, shoo.

3826
02:38:30,983 --> 02:38:33,450
Let's hear it. Let's go.

3827
02:38:33,450 --> 02:38:33,983
There's one heaven.

3828
02:38:33,983 --> 02:38:37,233
There's one heaven. I think it's sage.

3829
02:38:37,233 --> 02:38:37,950
Yeah,

3830
02:38:44,616 --> 02:38:47,333
oh, she was behind you. Oh.

3831
02:38:47,666 --> 02:38:50,133
Wait, what's your right
and what's your left?

3832
02:38:51,983 --> 02:38:53,633
Yeah. Then, yeah. Besides.

3833
02:38:55,416 --> 02:38:56,466
Oh, nice try.

3834
02:38:56,466 --> 02:38:58,233
I'm right here.

3835
02:38:58,233 --> 02:38:59,216
Oh, my gosh.

3836
02:38:59,216 --> 02:39:01,916
Like my back up into her.

3837
02:39:01,916 --> 02:39:03,983
I thought I was five heading,
but they five headed.

3838
02:39:04,383 --> 02:39:06,083
We can't take should we throw this place.

3839
02:39:06,083 --> 02:39:10,350
We don't go 930.

3840
02:39:11,633 --> 02:39:13,800
I think we got this. Got this.

3841
02:39:13,916 --> 02:39:15,900
I'm going to wash them with this.

3842
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:16,200
I bought.

3843
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:18,866
Up. Look, I could buy you a spectre

3844
02:39:18,866 --> 02:39:19,400
buy armour.

3845
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:19,933
Oh, okay.

3846
02:39:19,933 --> 02:39:22,116
Thank you. Yeah. The curse. Doesn't exist.

3847
02:39:22,566 --> 02:39:22,916
Yeah.

3848
02:39:22,916 --> 02:39:25,566
Yeah, I. Am just going back.

3849
02:39:25,883 --> 02:39:29,216
You guys, I want to play small points
let's do this.

3850
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:30,816
A little bit.

3851
02:39:31,283 --> 02:39:33,383
The 84 curse also exists.

3852
02:39:33,383 --> 02:39:35,616
OK, well well, then.

3853
02:39:35,616 --> 02:39:37,166
That's just not how.

3854
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:39,083
There's a lot.

3855
02:39:39,083 --> 02:39:40,500
I just. Can't.

3856
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:43,983
Uh huh, ok.

3857
02:39:45,816 --> 02:39:47,183
Oh, that doesn't penetrate that.

3858
02:39:47,183 --> 02:39:47,966
I'm done.

3859
02:39:48,783 --> 02:39:49,683
What do you mean,

3860
02:39:50,916 --> 02:39:51,416
it's just

3861
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:56,766
oh, man freezes there too.

3862
02:39:57,183 --> 02:39:57,900
Yeah.

3863
02:39:57,983 --> 02:40:01,350
She doesn't want to sight jets on sight.

3864
02:40:03,816 --> 02:40:06,483
Well, no way, man.

3865
02:40:06,483 --> 02:40:08,450
It's not the I

3866
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:10,083
Oh like.

3867
02:40:10,083 --> 02:40:13,016
That's right. 78.

3868
02:40:13,466 --> 02:40:14,033
Tell me.

3869
02:40:14,033 --> 02:40:16,733
All I got is so many things happening.

3870
02:40:16,733 --> 02:40:18,416
My life son was destroyed. All right.

3871
02:40:18,416 --> 02:40:20,066
Wow. OK.

3872
02:40:20,066 --> 02:40:21,033
Plenty

3873
02:40:22,416 --> 02:40:23,633
plenty.

3874
02:40:23,633 --> 02:40:25,950
And so oh.

3875
02:40:25,950 --> 02:40:27,666
She's drunk. She's jumping. Oh, no.

3876
02:40:27,666 --> 02:40:28,800
His wallet.

3877
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:32,966
Oh, that's her. Oh.

3878
02:40:33,366 --> 02:40:34,800
You're standing.

3879
02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:36,866
OK, ok. OK, ok.

3880
02:40:36,866 --> 02:40:38,616
Look, look, look.

3881
02:40:38,616 --> 02:40:41,633
Like all the man's hits in the world, ok?

3882
02:40:41,633 --> 02:40:43,616
Or at stake right now.

3883
02:40:47,316 --> 02:40:49,266
He wouldn't let down man things, right?

3884
02:40:49,266 --> 02:40:50,916
Oh, good try.

3885
02:40:50,916 --> 02:40:52,866
Try to think.

3886
02:40:52,866 --> 02:40:55,016
Nice t what?

3887
02:40:55,016 --> 02:40:57,783
Anti switching continues.

3888
02:40:58,650 --> 02:41:02,783
OK, we're here for so, like,
we don't get the curse right?

3889
02:41:03,416 --> 02:41:05,583
And we play.

3890
02:41:05,916 --> 02:41:07,866
Tough to prevent the curse
from. Happening.

3891
02:41:07,866 --> 02:41:09,933
Yeah, I saved it.

3892
02:41:09,933 --> 02:41:11,283
That's why I fired my old hat.

3893
02:41:11,283 --> 02:41:13,916
No one that's so easy.

3894
02:41:14,516 --> 02:41:15,816
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

3895
02:41:15,816 --> 02:41:18,516
Yeah. Yeah, exactly, exactly.

3896
02:41:19,266 --> 02:41:21,333
It's to dig for family. Harvey

3897
02:41:23,366 --> 02:41:25,200
that's exactly what the plan was.

3898
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:26,666
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

3899
02:41:26,666 --> 02:41:28,800
Do you like coffee?

3900
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:30,066
I like colleague. E.

3901
02:41:30,066 --> 02:41:31,116
I like coffee.

3902
02:41:31,533 --> 02:41:31,950
Soccer.

3903
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:34,800
What soccer club?

3904
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:38,583
Yeah, I love coffee flavoured
stuff. Me too.

3905
02:41:38,583 --> 02:41:40,316
But I also. Like off here.

3906
02:41:40,316 --> 02:41:41,466
God damn it.

3907
02:41:41,466 --> 02:41:43,883
No, oh.

3908
02:41:47,033 --> 02:41:48,216
Oh, God.

3909
02:41:48,216 --> 02:41:50,133
Oh, my God. What?

3910
02:41:50,133 --> 02:41:53,016
Oh, my God. I didn't even see that.

3911
02:41:53,016 --> 02:41:54,266
She just

3912
02:41:56,033 --> 02:41:56,816
they can't get all of us.

3913
02:41:56,816 --> 02:41:59,283
There's one behind the middle box,
one by mailbox, one's left side

3914
02:42:01,233 --> 02:42:02,216
I'm very low.

3915
02:42:02,216 --> 02:42:02,666
I can't watch.

3916
02:42:02,666 --> 02:42:03,383
You got

3917
02:42:05,283 --> 02:42:07,266
oh, the I.

3918
02:42:07,266 --> 02:42:07,833
Oh, man.

3919
02:42:07,833 --> 02:42:09,600
I'm getting hit by the eye so often.

3920
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,700
The last player standing

3921
02:42:14,883 --> 02:42:16,283
reloading.

3922
02:42:16,283 --> 02:42:18,433
Oh, liberty. Oh.

3923
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:21,483
I was a big brain.

3924
02:42:21,483 --> 02:42:22,433
Grenade.

3925
02:42:23,316 --> 02:42:24,816
First. Thing in the. Beginning.

3926
02:42:24,816 --> 02:42:26,816
I had no idea what it was.

3927
02:42:26,816 --> 02:42:28,950
All right, you heard it. And I died.

3928
02:42:29,016 --> 02:42:29,633
Who you are.

3929
02:42:31,316 --> 02:42:33,183
Go be these terror insects.

3930
02:42:33,183 --> 02:42:36,183
I don't like a choo. Choo choo

3931
02:42:36,183 --> 02:42:36,750
choo choo.

3932
02:42:36,750 --> 02:42:39,450
Maybe when they all rotated,
we could have rotated away.

3933
02:42:39,833 --> 02:42:42,750
Yeah. Mm

3934
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:43,916
who does that sound?

3935
02:42:43,916 --> 02:42:44,766
Weak.

3936
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:48,116
That's not really true.

3937
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:52,183
This just tapped their heads easy.

3938
02:42:52,816 --> 02:42:58,950
That's not really wow.

3939
02:42:59,933 --> 02:43:02,116
How do they know how the fuck she

3940
02:43:04,583 --> 02:43:07,166
oh, hold my shoulder.

3941
02:43:07,266 --> 02:43:08,166
Ouch.

3942
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:12,133
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

3943
02:43:12,133 --> 02:43:13,500
Ding, ding.

3944
02:43:14,966 --> 02:43:16,150
Oh, no. Oh, no.

3945
02:43:16,150 --> 02:43:16,983
Oh, God.

3946
02:43:16,983 --> 02:43:19,400
Oh, oh, oh,

3947
02:43:20,133 --> 02:43:23,316
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. OK.

3948
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,583
So I learnt. I learnt something there.

3949
02:43:25,650 --> 02:43:26,633
I was off.

3950
02:43:26,633 --> 02:43:29,283
The lot, so not. To pain.

3951
02:43:29,483 --> 02:43:31,733
What was that? Just killjoys.

3952
02:43:31,733 --> 02:43:32,033
It was.

3953
02:43:32,033 --> 02:43:34,083
Yeah, that was a double killjoy grenade.

3954
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,366
Had the alarm, but.

3955
02:43:36,366 --> 02:43:36,983
Archie's cheese.

3956
02:43:36,983 --> 02:43:39,150
OK, this time. Don't think we go middle.

3957
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:39,983
I think we go.

3958
02:43:40,033 --> 02:43:41,433
May be my pie from Lyndsey.

3959
02:43:41,433 --> 02:43:43,283
Fall in from. B and look for pix.

3960
02:43:43,283 --> 02:43:44,116
Yeah, that's ok.

3961
02:43:44,116 --> 02:43:46,233
Yeah. Yeah, I like doing that.
That's a good sign.

3962
02:43:46,866 --> 02:43:48,366
Yes. So they had to do that.

3963
02:43:48,366 --> 02:43:51,433
We now see why they never challenged
to be before with Lily.

3964
02:43:52,416 --> 02:43:52,716
Yeah.

3965
02:43:52,716 --> 02:43:53,566
Had to the.

3966
02:43:54,716 --> 02:43:55,683
Likes.

3967
02:44:00,783 --> 02:44:02,100
Of she's really low.

3968
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:04,583
Yeah. Yeah. 41 five to one.

3969
02:44:04,583 --> 02:44:07,233
No way we lose this whole a

3970
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:08,633
left side.

3971
02:44:08,633 --> 02:44:11,633
Left side. Of.

3972
02:44:12,933 --> 02:44:13,583
The market.

3973
02:44:13,583 --> 02:44:14,916
Oh no. Just one CC.

3974
02:44:14,916 --> 02:44:15,983
I'm going to have I'm going to hell.

3975
02:44:15,983 --> 02:44:19,133
I mean that's it can't be long enough.

3976
02:44:19,133 --> 02:44:19,916
To catch you.

3977
02:44:20,033 --> 02:44:26,100
Got to oh nice nice.

3978
02:44:26,183 --> 02:44:27,533
Then they. Keep me.

3979
02:44:27,533 --> 02:44:29,766
Here give me your gaming, your gaming,
your gaming. Too. What do we do now?

3980
02:44:29,766 --> 02:44:31,916
I don't know what you doing with me
remaining?

3981
02:44:31,916 --> 02:44:34,316
Oh, we have a flat with a plinth.

3982
02:44:34,316 --> 02:44:36,400
Or the bombs down with phrases.

3983
02:44:36,416 --> 02:44:39,033
Can I hear you loose? Tell me.

3984
02:44:39,233 --> 02:44:40,283
Let's pick together all right.

3985
02:44:40,283 --> 02:44:42,750
One, two, three, peak.

3986
02:44:42,866 --> 02:44:45,983
Stick out my guys.

3987
02:44:46,483 --> 02:44:48,433
Look at about.

3988
02:44:50,333 --> 02:44:51,750
I have ten different.

3989
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:53,166
Arms for. Eight more years.

3990
02:44:55,883 --> 02:44:58,350
Does anyone have funds on this?

3991
02:44:58,766 --> 02:44:59,916
I got you.

3992
02:45:00,066 --> 02:45:01,566
You guys are pets.

3993
02:45:01,566 --> 02:45:02,633
I wish I.

3994
02:45:02,783 --> 02:45:05,366
Could. Have them. I don't want oh.

3995
02:45:05,766 --> 02:45:09,466
Well, I don't have a pet right now,
but I'm babysitting a dog. Oh.

3996
02:45:10,566 --> 02:45:12,633
Uh, I think it's a beagle.

3997
02:45:12,833 --> 02:45:13,650
I'm not. Sure.

3998
02:45:13,650 --> 02:45:16,550
A beagle. A beagle? Yeah, a beagle.

3999
02:45:16,566 --> 02:45:17,466
You know.

4000
02:45:17,466 --> 02:45:18,766
I love the results.

4001
02:45:18,766 --> 02:45:22,200
With everything seasoning.

4002
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:24,083
What kind of cream cheese? Something.

4003
02:45:24,083 --> 02:45:25,500
Mm. Strawberry.

4004
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:27,150
Very extraordinary. Yeah.

4005
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,766
I love strawberry.

4006
02:45:29,216 --> 02:45:30,183
I love honey walnuts.

4007
02:45:30,183 --> 02:45:31,733
You did?

4008
02:45:32,616 --> 02:45:33,866
That was terrifying.

4009
02:45:33,866 --> 02:45:36,083
I want to know.

4010
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,466
All right, boy.

Goddammit, there's one.

4013
02:45:40,583 --> 02:45:41,783
That comes.

4014
02:45:45,633 --> 02:45:48,000
When heaven.

4015
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,083
Spikes down a glass.

4016
02:45:55,166 --> 02:45:57,450
They are so dead

4017
02:45:57,450 --> 02:45:59,250
from destroyed.

4018
02:45:59,916 --> 02:46:00,450
That's when

4019
02:46:01,983 --> 02:46:02,766
oh, my God.

4020
02:46:02,766 --> 02:46:05,633
Oh, my God. It's OK. It's OK.

4021
02:46:05,633 --> 02:46:09,300
Hey, you stop.
15 seconds. Fucking Oh, stop

4022
02:46:10,416 --> 02:46:11,116
sakes.

4023
02:46:12,383 --> 02:46:14,550
Oh, that's what they're doing.

4024
02:46:19,583 --> 02:46:22,883
Oh, my poor show to go to hell.

4025
02:46:23,366 --> 02:46:26,316
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4026
02:46:29,166 --> 02:46:30,483
What happened when I don't have any?

4027
02:46:30,483 --> 02:46:32,850
30 seconds left. My heart rate
my heart rate went.

4028
02:46:32,850 --> 02:46:35,483
Over to one on the wall.
One well, one below

4029
02:46:35,483 --> 02:46:36,333
sure. Right.

4030
02:46:37,016 --> 02:46:39,666
Oh, that's right.

4031
02:46:43,416 --> 02:46:44,250
That's pure panic.

4032
02:46:44,250 --> 02:46:47,033
I think my heart rate,
we hit like one E to.

4033
02:46:47,033 --> 02:46:49,233
The we still get the kill, the killjoy.

4034
02:46:49,233 --> 02:46:51,233
Even you just got to scream.

4035
02:46:51,533 --> 02:46:53,766
Yeah, yeah. Scream at. Them.

4036
02:46:53,766 --> 02:46:55,866
Yeah. Scream for the kill.

4037
02:46:55,866 --> 02:46:57,716
Oh, oh, man.

4038
02:46:57,716 --> 02:46:59,316
I took a shower before she even had to.

4039
02:46:59,316 --> 02:47:00,383
Another shower.

4040
02:47:00,383 --> 02:47:00,800
Still

4041
02:47:03,816 --> 02:47:04,283
I think.

4042
02:47:04,283 --> 02:47:06,750
I think I'll be sailing,
but don't mind me.

4043
02:47:07,583 --> 02:47:08,316
I'll say.

4044
02:47:08,466 --> 02:47:12,066
Do you think it's weird to take showers
once every three days?

4045
02:47:12,933 --> 02:47:14,250
No, no. No.

4046
02:47:14,250 --> 02:47:16,083
I mean, if you're not that oily.

4047
02:47:16,083 --> 02:47:18,150
Right? Yeah. It depends on what
physical activity you're doing.

4048
02:47:18,150 --> 02:47:20,816
No physical activity.
You just sitting and playing games.

4049
02:47:21,066 --> 02:47:21,716
What do you. Think? Yeah.

4050
02:47:21,716 --> 02:47:25,500
And if you don't have that much oily
skin, then you're killing it.

4051
02:47:28,283 --> 02:47:28,983
Every three days.

4052
02:47:28,983 --> 02:47:30,183
No big deal.

4053
02:47:30,416 --> 02:47:32,700
I want that comic book.

4054
02:47:34,716 --> 02:47:37,100
I just like to fast

4055
02:47:38,316 --> 02:47:41,483
I drew a circle around that guy's head.

4056
02:47:41,566 --> 02:47:44,816
Also, the nice.

4057
02:47:45,116 --> 02:47:46,266

02:47:48,866 --> 02:47:51,333
She's made Raina's medal. Yeah.

4060
02:47:51,333 --> 02:47:52,650
I had Spike on me. Whoops.

4061
02:47:52,650 --> 02:47:54,066
Well, that's. Great.

4062
02:47:54,966 --> 02:47:57,266

So yeah, but it's around there. Huh?

02:48:07,266 --> 02:48:08,916
Oh. Just run. Just run. Just run.

Yeah, OK.

4072
02:48:13,533 --> 02:48:14,366
He's watching me.

Yeah.

4076
02:48:24,883 --> 02:48:27,183
Oh, oh, my God.

4077
02:48:27,450 --> 02:48:27,966
That's right.

You got the.

Is that a recording? Yeah.

Thank you.

4086
02:48:48,083 --> 02:48:51,800
But in my dream, I see you

4087
02:48:52,983 --> 02:48:55,316
I feel you.

4088
02:48:55,683 --> 02:48:56,433
Oh, I reached for.

4089
02:48:56,433 --> 02:48:58,533
And I know. That's all I know.

4090
02:48:59,366 --> 02:49:00,083
I don't know any of it.

4091
02:49:00,083 --> 02:49:03,150
Really looks like him frogging until.

4092
02:49:03,283 --> 02:49:03,983
Yeah.

4093
02:49:04,283 --> 02:49:06,533
I knew immediately
when you said I feel you instead of.

4094
02:49:06,533 --> 02:49:10,416
I hear you on the phone.

4095
02:49:10,416 --> 02:49:12,416
You is I feel you're a hero.

4096
02:49:12,516 --> 02:49:13,116
I don't know.

4097
02:49:13,116 --> 02:49:15,333
I thought I was.
I always thought I saw you.

4098
02:49:16,316 --> 02:49:17,700
Oh, that's nice.

4099
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,216
You're not.

4100
02:49:18,216 --> 02:49:18,866
Yes. Notice that.

4101
02:49:18,866 --> 02:49:21,116
I hear you. And it was like,
you know, that's.

4102
02:49:21,116 --> 02:49:21,933
Just not made.

4103
02:49:21,933 --> 02:49:22,350
More, right?

4104
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:25,583
Then I feel it's scary. OK.

4105
02:49:27,116 --> 02:49:27,783
You know.

4106
02:49:28,683 --> 02:49:30,150
But then all right.

4107
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:33,116
Well, good luck. Gamers

4108
02:49:33,116 --> 02:49:35,333

4109
02:49:35,333 --> 02:49:37,833
Is on the vandal. There's no way I could.

4110
02:49:38,933 --> 02:49:39,450
Get in there.

4111
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:39,816
Go, go.

4112
02:49:39,816 --> 02:49:42,033
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go,
go, go, go.

4113
02:49:42,366 --> 02:49:43,650
Oh, yes.

4114
02:49:43,650 --> 02:49:45,366
Ha ha ha ha.

4115
02:49:47,183 --> 02:49:47,483
How is she?

4116
02:49:47,483 --> 02:49:48,266
Not that.

4117
02:49:49,983 --> 02:49:50,400
Ok. OK.

4118
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:51,633
Plant plump. Purple, thank God.

4119
02:49:51,633 --> 02:49:52,283
Is not a.

4120
02:49:56,433 --> 02:49:58,250
She. Still have any idea.

4121
02:49:58,250 --> 02:50:00,933
How. She might be walking?

4122
02:50:00,933 --> 02:50:02,550
Yeah, she might be

4123
02:50:04,133 --> 02:50:05,000
something.

4124
02:50:06,450 --> 02:50:06,866
Nothing.

4125
02:50:07,650 --> 02:50:08,550
I thought.

4126
02:50:09,366 --> 02:50:10,566
Would she go

4127
02:50:13,116 --> 02:50:15,266
down where a cage is?

4128
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:17,016
She might be.

4129
02:50:17,316 --> 02:50:18,633
Yeah. I'm watching amy.

4130
02:50:18,633 --> 02:50:20,250
Amy and might be exposed.

4131
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:20,916
I see.

4132
02:50:21,233 --> 02:50:24,116
And Tierney dropped just yet, so

4133
02:50:35,616 --> 02:50:36,750
I think we went.

4134
02:50:36,866 --> 02:50:38,933
Yeah, well, I'm pushing.

4135
02:50:38,933 --> 02:50:40,266
Yeah, I think they're saving the arm.

4136
02:50:40,266 --> 02:50:41,516
That's probably why.

4137
02:50:41,516 --> 02:50:45,333
Uh, OK, Ron.

4138
02:50:45,783 --> 02:50:48,750
No. No, no.

4139
02:50:48,750 --> 02:50:50,316
I should have ran faster.

4140
02:50:50,316 --> 02:50:53,216

02:52:47,666 --> 02:52:49,283
Oh, I guess we have to play.

4187
02:52:49,283 --> 02:52:51,033
One more after all.

4188
02:52:51,333 --> 02:52:53,383
Yes. It's not a real winner.

4189
02:52:53,383 --> 02:52:53,916
Just have to. Absolutely.

4190
02:52:53,916 --> 02:52:55,833
Another when I. Was already 11.

4191
02:52:55,833 --> 02:52:58,050
Today
we're going to lose anyway, right? Yeah.

4192
02:52:58,083 --> 02:52:59,783
They were going to lose anyway.

4193
02:52:59,783 --> 02:53:02,066
As I was, like, quit a little more.

4194
02:53:03,333 --> 02:53:05,066
He will be free.

4195
02:53:05,850 --> 02:53:07,616
And I'm going to pick them.

4196
02:53:07,616 --> 02:53:10,500
And they were going to lose anyway.

4197
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:15,183
There's no one watching MIT or not.

4198
02:53:15,566 --> 02:53:18,066
There's no one not being so sad.

4199
02:53:18,066 --> 02:53:19,200
There's no one here.

4200
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,250
Yeah. Maybe they just maybe.

4201
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:22,166
They stocks a on your head.

4202
02:53:22,166 --> 02:53:24,466
I just realised I have a thing.

4203
02:53:27,283 --> 02:53:28,133
That was embarrassing.

4204
02:53:29,233 --> 02:53:32,400
Oh it was tactical setting them up
to be more confident.

4205
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:34,433
I like the city where city girl city.

4206
02:53:35,016 --> 02:53:36,866
Is feeling safe.

4207
02:53:38,316 --> 02:53:39,366
Mind you love.

4208
02:53:39,366 --> 02:53:41,316
Side by side of city know.

4209
02:53:41,316 --> 02:53:42,216
I know.

4210
02:53:42,216 --> 02:53:43,516
That's why I got that going.

4211
02:53:43,516 --> 02:53:45,683
I was just like, no, this was fun.

4212
02:53:46,583 --> 02:53:48,216
Oh, my goodness.

4213
02:53:57,416 --> 02:53:59,483
Oh, my God, I forgot to order.

4214
02:53:59,550 --> 02:54:03,833
Nice cider, right?

4215
02:54:04,916 --> 02:54:06,816
No, I did. Yeah.

4216
02:54:06,816 --> 02:54:09,183
Oh, right.

4217
02:54:10,466 --> 02:54:11,250
There you go.

4218
02:54:11,466 --> 02:54:14,916
Run at them enough
and eventually they'll fall.

4219
02:54:14,916 --> 02:54:16,166
For vandal.

4220
02:54:16,350 --> 02:54:17,766
Match points.

4221
02:54:17,766 --> 02:54:19,383
Let's put them in

4222
02:54:19,766 --> 02:54:21,633
match points.

4223
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:25,716
I feel I actually do feel kind of bad
because they don't have two people right.

4224
02:54:25,833 --> 02:54:26,883
OK, come on.

4225
02:54:26,883 --> 02:54:29,400
Time to make is fair. Ref

4226
02:54:30,666 --> 02:54:32,666

4227
02:54:32,666 --> 02:54:34,700
OK, I'll just sit here with my gun. OK.

02:54:34,716 --> 02:54:35,716
You guys got this.

OK. OK,
if there we sit. A you guys can push me.

4230
02:54:38,183 --> 02:54:39,900
All right? I said I'll believe you.

4231
02:54:41,183 --> 02:54:43,283
But i already told them knife fight.

4232
02:54:43,283 --> 02:54:45,400
Yeah. You know,
not fight it. Yeah, you're right.

4233
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:47,400
I fight. Fight. Fight.

4234
02:54:48,066 --> 02:54:49,966
Fight, fight.

4235
02:54:49,966 --> 02:54:51,716
Fight. Oh, my god. They're shooting.
They're shooting.

4236
02:54:51,716 --> 02:54:53,183
They're shooting a knife fight.

4237
02:54:53,183 --> 02:54:55,516
They're shooting.
They're shooting a few wars.

4238
02:54:55,533 --> 02:54:57,616
You are very.

4239
02:55:02,433 --> 02:55:04,133
Oh, this is so sad.

4240
02:55:04,133 --> 02:55:06,266
Yeah, what you're hearing.
What the hell is.

4241
02:55:06,366 --> 02:55:07,533
He yelling at a knife?

4242
02:55:07,533 --> 02:55:09,083
I oh, my gosh.

4243
02:55:09,083 --> 02:55:12,933
Abilities are ok. OK.

4244
02:55:15,633 --> 02:55:19,016
So pauses

4245
02:55:25,733 --> 02:55:26,016

4246
02:55:26,016 --> 02:55:28,133
I'll go flank him on the phone.
Come watch this.

4247
02:55:28,733 --> 02:55:30,150
Big shots. Big shots.

4248
02:55:30,150 --> 02:55:32,633
I think is going to play the runaway game
until they have to.

4249
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:34,733
We have to buddy. Me on mom.

4250
02:55:34,733 --> 02:55:36,033
Oh, never mind.

4251
02:55:36,033 --> 02:55:40,266
Backs down when I leave you on here.

4252
02:55:41,316 --> 02:55:43,766
Oh, like a tripod or something.

4253
02:55:45,683 --> 02:55:47,433
Oh, yes.

4254
02:55:47,433 --> 02:55:49,650
Yeah, yeah. That was fun.

4255
02:55:49,650 --> 02:55:51,300
Thanks for playing, Lily. Appreciate it.

4256
02:55:52,733 --> 02:55:55,683
I'm going to be real awkward now. Here

4257
02:55:55,683 --> 02:55:57,666

4258
02:55:57,666 --> 02:55:58,166

Oh. Can I can I can I add you?

02:56:01,416 --> 02:56:02,850
Oh, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

4261
02:56:02,850 --> 02:56:07,016
Yeah, I think I don't have my auto reject
on right now.

4262
02:56:07,166 --> 02:56:09,233
Yeah, I don't feel free to add me.

4263
02:56:09,233 --> 02:56:10,283
OK, hold on.

4264
02:56:10,283 --> 02:56:11,316
There's an auto reject.

4265
02:56:11,316 --> 02:56:12,866
Yeah, I turned mine off.

4266
02:56:12,866 --> 02:56:15,683
Yeah, in the settings
you could auto reject friend request.

4267
02:56:15,683 --> 02:56:17,616
Oh, for Bellerin.

4268
02:56:17,616 --> 02:56:19,266
Yeah, all I can do that.

4269
02:56:19,266 --> 02:56:21,416
All I need to do that sometime. OK.

4270
02:56:21,416 --> 02:56:23,016
That's pretty useful.

4271
02:56:23,016 --> 02:56:23,266
Yeah.

4272
02:56:23,266 --> 02:56:25,583
If you're free to add you
or is that easier.

Just to add them?

4274
02:56:28,783 --> 02:56:30,683

Oh, yeah.

We should do league next time
because you said you want to do league.

4314
02:57:55,533 --> 02:57:58,350
I'm also feeling like sometimes.
Oh, boy. League.

Oh, I don't. Mind.

02:58:07,566 --> 02:58:10,266
Guys. We could play amongst us. Oh, oh.

4322
02:58:10,283 --> 02:58:11,883
You know, I'm down for that.

4323
02:58:11,883 --> 02:58:14,066
I haven't played amongst us
in a while, so.

What do you mean?

4326
02:58:18,116 --> 02:58:19,866
I've tried to invite people
to play amongst us,

4327
02:58:19,866 --> 02:58:21,633
and everybody is just like, oh,
the last time we played

4328
02:58:21,633 --> 02:58:23,433

4329
02:58:23,433 --> 02:58:25,066
Oh, wait.

4330
02:58:25,066 --> 02:58:25,733
Come at me.

4331
02:58:25,733 --> 02:58:28,183
OK, well, the

4332
02:58:29,033 --> 02:58:32,516
when there's 15 players, it's a bit much,
but if it is, it should be fine.

4333
02:58:33,083 --> 02:58:35,033
50 intensive. Yeah.

4334
02:58:35,033 --> 02:58:38,366
Yeah, 15 is kind of crazy, though. I

4335
02:58:38,366 --> 02:58:41,616
All right, guys, who's going to be our
fifth, or you just won't go with us for.

4336
02:58:42,750 --> 02:58:43,533
Up to you.

4337
02:58:43,533 --> 02:58:44,766
You have anyone you can call? Yeah.

4338
02:58:44,766 --> 02:58:46,500
I have no body.

4339
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:49,166
No. Is is like, what time is it right now?

4340

So I don't think anybody else is on
right now.

4342
02:58:53,666 --> 02:58:55,883
Mm hmm.

4343
02:58:56,550 --> 02:58:58,583
A better bet betting.

4344
02:58:58,583 --> 02:59:01,533
I'm just going to click Start
and see what happens.

4345
02:59:01,533 --> 02:59:02,316
All right?

4346
02:59:02,633 --> 02:59:03,900

02:59:18,083 --> 02:59:21,616

already and another one that's just.

Oh, shit. Yeah. Do you want me to post
a thing and then just on.

4357

4361
02:59:44,216 --> 02:59:45,816
Yeah.
I don't know who else is on right now.

4362
02:59:45,816 --> 02:59:48,083
Everybody is in the UK getting crunk.

4363
02:59:48,233 --> 02:59:51,233
Like, are you saw like what's a

4364
02:59:52,283 --> 02:59:53,783

4365
02:59:53,783 --> 02:59:54,683
Are you not?

4366
02:59:54,683 --> 02:59:57,966
Like, all, all my friends, they're just

02:59:57,966 --> 03:00:01,350
And so I know who else is around so yeah.

4368
03:00:02,966 --> 03:00:04,283
Also my room is so sweaty.

4369
03:00:04,283 --> 03:00:06,450
It is like super hot in my room right now.

4370
03:00:06,450 --> 03:00:08,666
Oh my God. Like. Oh.

4371
03:00:08,666 --> 03:00:10,233
I am dripping sweat.

4372
03:00:10,233 --> 03:00:10,416
All right.

4373
03:00:10,416 --> 03:00:13,466
Now, not really dripping,
but it's like I'm feeling it, you know,

4374
03:00:13,683 --> 03:00:16,716
I'm feeling it starts to hit because like,

4375
03:00:16,716 --> 03:00:17,933
it's my computer.

4376
03:00:17,933 --> 03:00:21,233
And also the fact that's just hot here,
usually I have my air conditioner on,

4377
03:00:21,233 --> 03:00:22,466
but it's so loud

4378
03:00:22,466 --> 03:00:25,116
that you guys would be able to hear it
if I turn on my air conditioner.

4379
03:00:25,233 --> 03:00:28,316
I don't want to do that to you guys
because it's like it's kind of like

4380
03:00:29,466 --> 03:00:30,033
little more of

4381
03:00:30,033 --> 03:00:33,100
a little
bit of a little in the background.

4382
03:00:33,100 --> 03:00:34,200
Mm hmm. Mm.

4383
03:00:34,766 --> 03:00:36,783
Oh, we've got so many people coming in
nowadays.

4384
03:00:37,266 --> 03:00:40,016
Hello. Welcome back.
Thank you. I'm sweaty.

4385
03:00:40,083 --> 03:00:40,650
Welcome back.

4386
03:00:40,650 --> 03:00:43,416
Like like you're not even, like, gamer
so I.

4387
03:00:43,433 --> 03:00:45,383
It's just because it's

4388
03:00:45,383 --> 03:00:47,733
Yeah. Oh.

You sound like. I'm in.

03:00:54,066 --> 03:00:56,166
Oh, bruh. Max.

4393
03:00:56,466 --> 03:00:58,166
A little bit of musk.

4394
03:00:58,166 --> 03:01:01,350
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I see.

4395
03:01:01,350 --> 03:01:03,983
All right. Oh. Ooh.

4396
03:01:04,733 --> 03:01:07,633
You two want us to leave for a little bit?

4397
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:10,433
Come back. No, no. No, no.
I don't love that.

4398
03:01:10,466 --> 03:01:13,683
This is is this NCR? I don't know.

03:01:16,533 --> 03:01:18,766
Oh, I just muted that guy immediately.
I don't know.

4401
03:01:18,783 --> 03:01:21,750
He was about to say,
but I'm probably. I'm glad I did. Oh.

4402
03:01:22,883 --> 03:01:24,533
I have the muted.

4403
03:01:24,533 --> 03:01:25,316

Oh, yoru.

4409
03:01:36,983 --> 03:01:37,466
Yeah.

4410
03:01:37,466 --> 03:01:40,683
Ooh, I think I'm going to try someone else
that's different.

4411
03:01:40,683 --> 03:01:43,233
See, I've been playing
a lot of chamber and

4412
03:01:46,233 --> 03:01:48,083
which I try.

4413
03:01:48,633 --> 03:01:49,683
This person is hard.

4414
03:01:49,683 --> 03:01:52,683
Every time I try to bird people,
I end up flashing my team.

4415
03:01:53,366 --> 03:01:56,166
Oh, yeah.

4416
03:01:56,166 --> 03:01:56,833
Or I flash.

4417
03:01:56,833 --> 03:02:03,133
Next time you can practise me a flash,
you hey.

4418
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:05,966
You. The millions and millions of silence.

4419
03:02:07,083 --> 03:02:09,816
That was that was too you.

4420
03:02:09,966 --> 03:02:12,566
Oh, oh, yes.

4421
03:02:12,566 --> 03:02:14,133
There you go.

4422
03:02:14,816 --> 03:02:16,083
Oh, yeah.

4423
03:02:16,366 --> 03:02:17,700
Mm mm.

4424
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:20,216
I love Apex.

4425
03:02:20,216 --> 03:02:20,750
I tried.

4426
03:02:20,750 --> 03:02:23,733
I haven't tried it in a while. OK.

4427
03:02:24,366 --> 03:02:25,916
Let's go.

4428
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,433
I'm flashy

4429
03:02:29,433 --> 03:02:35,133
to speedy OK?

4430
03:02:35,766 --> 03:02:37,133
All they dodged.

4431
03:02:37,133 --> 03:02:40,016
Ow, ow. Ow, ow. Ow.

4432
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:41,100
You have to wait again.

4433
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:43,200
Yeah, oh, that's fine.
I know. And I love them. Right.

4434
03:02:44,183 --> 03:02:45,816
Fin? Nana fish.

4435
03:02:45,816 --> 03:02:47,250
You might have wanted to.

4436
03:02:47,250 --> 03:02:48,033
I don't know.

4437
03:02:51,866 --> 03:02:54,750
Bah bah bah bah bah bah.

4438
03:02:54,750 --> 03:02:57,116
Maybe you mute that guy.

4439
03:02:57,150 --> 03:02:59,066
All right, we're in Haven.

4440
03:02:59,066 --> 03:03:01,416
This time. Hmm.

4441
03:03:03,666 --> 03:03:05,433
I think.

4442
03:03:05,433 --> 03:03:06,483
I. Oh, my gosh.

4443
03:03:06,483 --> 03:03:08,466
That is the lock fade.

4444
03:03:08,466 --> 03:03:09,866
Yeah.

4445
03:03:09,866 --> 03:03:11,850
I like her.

4446
03:03:12,033 --> 03:03:16,233
She's really hot, so I like her abilities,
her theme, her mechanics.

4447
03:03:16,233 --> 03:03:16,633
Is right.

4448
03:03:16,633 --> 03:03:19,650
As I was watching Alina's video,

4449
03:03:19,650 --> 03:03:22,466
but it all has left my brain.

4450
03:03:22,950 --> 03:03:24,350
Mm hmm.

4451
03:03:30,816 --> 03:03:32,166
I don't know.

4452
03:03:32,166 --> 03:03:34,433
I'm indecisive.

4453
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:36,116
Sure.

4454
03:03:36,116 --> 03:03:37,083
Why not?

4455
03:03:39,983 --> 03:03:41,633
Just give an offering, like, 10 seconds

4456
03:03:41,633 --> 03:03:43,733
to see if they want to play

4457
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:49,366
along. Boy.

4458
03:03:51,566 --> 03:03:52,350
Oh, boy.

4459
03:03:52,583 --> 03:03:53,316
Oh, my God.

4460
03:03:53,316 --> 03:03:55,800
Guys, we've been shooting
for, like, 3 hours.

4461
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:57,933
That's crazy. It.
And I even feel like 3 hours.

4462
03:03:57,933 --> 03:03:58,583
Watch.

4463
03:03:58,983 --> 03:04:01,533
See, this will have, like,
I enjoy playing games like this.

4464
03:04:01,833 --> 03:04:02,250
I love. Her.

4465
03:04:02,250 --> 03:04:03,866
My brain off is kind of hot.

4466
03:04:03,866 --> 03:04:05,833
I'm down. Bed kind of semis. Like.

4467
03:04:08,700 --> 03:04:10,083
As it should be.

4468
03:04:10,083 --> 03:04:12,183
Well, let's go. Oh.

4469
03:04:16,083 --> 03:04:17,166
All right.

4470
03:04:18,833 --> 03:04:21,300
Burst Updraught.

4471
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:22,733
Oh, my God. Oh. OK.

4472
03:04:22,733 --> 03:04:24,333
We've got a fifth for next game.

4473
03:04:24,333 --> 03:04:24,750
Argh!

4474
03:04:24,750 --> 03:04:27,866
Oh, my

4475
03:04:31,883 --> 03:04:33,666
why did I read that, Chad?

4476
03:04:33,666 --> 03:04:36,183
Because I wanted to.

4477
03:04:37,916 --> 03:04:39,416
Chewy Amino is a big boy.

4478
03:04:39,416 --> 03:04:40,016
What was he doing?

4479
03:04:40,016 --> 03:04:41,433
Yeah. Yeah, you got to.

4480
03:04:41,433 --> 03:04:44,016
You got to let them know, you know?

4481
03:04:44,583 --> 03:04:45,216
Yeah.

4482
03:04:45,216 --> 03:04:47,283
Keep them not expecting things.

4483
03:04:48,383 --> 03:04:49,716
Not expecting.

4484
03:04:49,716 --> 03:04:51,216
Things.

4485
03:04:51,866 --> 03:04:56,333
And even though it was barely English,
it sounded fancy.

4486
03:04:56,516 --> 03:04:58,900
It's something quite fancy. Oh.

4487
03:04:58,900 --> 03:05:01,633
I like like, the one off.

4488
03:05:01,916 --> 03:05:03,066
I'm exposed.

4489
03:05:03,483 --> 03:05:04,283
Mm hmm.

4490
03:05:04,283 --> 03:05:05,783
There you are, bitch.

4491
03:05:05,783 --> 03:05:07,533
Just like my chair.

4492
03:05:08,633 --> 03:05:08,933
Yeah.

4493
03:05:08,933 --> 03:05:10,566
You exposed them.

4494
03:05:12,683 --> 03:05:13,716
Oh, gosh.

4495
03:05:13,716 --> 03:05:14,483
I mean.

4496
03:05:16,050 --> 03:05:16,883
All help.

4497
03:05:16,883 --> 03:05:19,200
Oh, I'm sure she's all right.

4498
03:05:19,233 --> 03:05:21,683
Nice, nice, nice. I'm low. I'm low.

4499
03:05:21,683 --> 03:05:22,116
Yeah.

4500
03:05:23,333 --> 03:05:24,983
She's back site, back site, back site.

4501
03:05:24,983 --> 03:05:25,883
Oh, one.

4502
03:05:25,883 --> 03:05:28,550
One coming out of. Garage
madness. Down. Me.

4503
03:05:28,716 --> 03:05:30,666
Oops. Well, yeah, there's one.

4504
03:05:30,666 --> 03:05:31,583
There's one front.

4505
03:05:31,583 --> 03:05:33,866
Kills them and keep them in our garage.

4506
03:05:34,083 --> 03:05:36,800
She's on grass.
She's on grass. Right now. Yeah.

4507
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,616
Oh, oh, oh, no.

4508
03:05:38,616 --> 03:05:40,500
She's right
outside. Bucky, look, you got this

4509
03:05:42,450 --> 03:05:43,633
fighting

4510
03:05:45,450 --> 03:05:45,683
he's.

4511
03:05:45,683 --> 03:05:48,366
Oh, he's just one girl.

4512
03:05:48,683 --> 03:05:50,333
I think she's fun, right?

4513
03:05:50,333 --> 03:05:51,933
Or she might, you know.

4514
03:05:51,933 --> 03:05:54,733
Oh, a little.

4515
03:05:54,783 --> 03:05:57,866
He's. Oh, give me that.

4516
03:05:57,866 --> 03:05:58,950
Whatever happens.

4517
03:05:58,950 --> 03:06:00,966
Shocking who.

4518
03:06:00,966 --> 03:06:03,683
Saquon was. I'm

4519
03:06:03,683 --> 03:06:03,983
guessing.

4520
03:06:03,983 --> 03:06:05,133
Don't panic

4521
03:06:06,983 --> 03:06:08,433
you know, Turkish?

4522
03:06:09,116 --> 03:06:11,933
Heck, no. Oh.

4523
03:06:12,116 --> 03:06:12,450
It's just.

4524
03:06:12,450 --> 03:06:14,850
She's like,
whatever happens, Tarquin, don't panic.

4525
03:06:14,850 --> 03:06:17,250
I guess. You know,
that sounds about right? Yeah.

4526
03:06:17,250 --> 03:06:19,100
Oh, it's like hunkering down the tartar.

4527
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:20,016
Groom.

4528
03:06:20,483 --> 03:06:22,450
Where he keeps all the rest.

4529
03:06:22,450 --> 03:06:25,016
Do think I've never watched that movie?

4530
03:06:25,550 --> 03:06:27,650
You can't really like three.

4531
03:06:27,666 --> 03:06:30,216
He no one watched Lion King. Why? Why?

4532
03:06:30,366 --> 03:06:31,733
You mean I just never.

4533
03:06:31,733 --> 03:06:34,500
Watch it in biology? Really?

4534
03:06:34,866 --> 03:06:35,666
Hospital stuff.

4535
03:06:35,666 --> 03:06:38,700
Got that one of those, like,
end of the school deals.

4536
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,033
They just let you watch

4537
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:42,466
For me, it was.

4538
03:06:42,466 --> 03:06:45,116

Oh, yeah. Breslin's one,

He's really, really, really low.

03:07:30,266 --> 03:07:31,200
He's out of. Sight.

4559
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:33,000
Wow. He's just good, though.

I think he cleared, by the way, whatever.

4663
03:12:37,016 --> 03:12:40,366
No, but always flanks.

4664
03:12:40,366 --> 03:12:41,316
Well off and fade.

One week.

4674
03:13:09,416 --> 03:13:11,816
There's an app on my body

4675
03:13:12,516 --> 03:13:13,716

03:13:13,716 --> 03:13:16,700

Nice balance.

Oh, she knew where I was, but it's okay.

4680
03:13:30,033 --> 03:13:31,950
I think Chamber has her.

4681
03:13:32,283 --> 03:13:36,166

4682
03:13:37,133 --> 03:13:40,166
All you got think you

Can you send the thing?
Yeah. That's convenient.

Yeah, ok.

4690
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:01,866
All right.

4691
03:14:01,866 --> 03:14:03,216
We're getting fish in here.

4692
03:14:04,166 --> 03:14:05,316
Yeah, ok.

4693
03:14:05,316 --> 03:14:06,866
OK, fish.

4694
03:14:07,350 --> 03:14:09,566
In a fish. Wow, that was really good.

4695
03:14:09,566 --> 03:14:12,433
I guess we just. We stopped them.

4696
03:14:12,433 --> 03:14:14,316
We use the restroom real quick.

03:14:14,316 --> 03:14:16,650
OK, if you're not a.

4698
03:14:16,650 --> 03:14:18,450

Finn. Hannah, where are we?

4702

This is such a different world.

4703
03:14:28,116 --> 03:14:30,033
Oh, well, you know what it is.

4704
03:14:30,033 --> 03:14:30,866

Are you high?

4707
03:14:34,466 --> 03:14:36,150
I thought it was a private group.

4708
03:14:36,150 --> 03:14:38,633
Call me oh.

4709
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:42,183
Oh. Honestly, we could've moved, but,
I mean, I'd like.

Oh, my God.

4717
03:14:57,383 --> 03:14:58,466
Right? Yeah.

03:15:02,316 --> 03:15:03,600
house chatter on right now.

4720
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,733
Uh, what's up with you guys?

4721
03:15:05,733 --> 03:15:06,750
Doing?

4722
03:15:07,316 --> 03:15:09,033
I am good.

4723
03:15:09,033 --> 03:15:09,783
I'm thrilled.

4724
03:15:09,783 --> 03:15:12,266
You know, I'm really feeling it, like,
unironically.

4725
03:15:12,266 --> 03:15:14,583
I'm really feeling it right now.
Are you feeling it, Mr. Kraft?

4726
03:15:14,616 --> 03:15:17,216
Yes, I'm feeling it's SpongeBob. Patrick.

4727
03:15:17,216 --> 03:15:19,783
I don't know who both of them say it's on.

4728
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:22,583
They just got out of a very intense

4729
03:15:24,150 --> 03:15:25,233
reading session.

4730
03:15:25,233 --> 03:15:26,300
So in.

4731
03:15:26,300 --> 03:15:28,066
Final Fantasy.

4732
03:15:29,966 --> 03:15:33,633
Like brain drain right now,

4733
03:15:34,883 --> 03:15:36,450
brain drain

4734
03:15:38,183 --> 03:15:40,566
how long have you guys been playing?

4735
03:15:40,566 --> 03:15:44,883
Ah, it's been, like, three and a half
hours already, but I'm still feeling good.

4736
03:15:45,533 --> 03:15:46,266
Yeah.

4737
03:15:46,916 --> 03:15:49,016
Yeah, I'm enjoying two rounds ago.

4738
03:15:49,016 --> 03:15:50,766
Oh, OK.

4739
03:15:50,766 --> 03:15:53,016
Oh, she's been screaming for 3 hours. OK.

4740
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:54,816
Also, hold on. Give me some.

4741
03:15:54,816 --> 03:15:56,766
Ah. Oh, my God.

4742
03:15:56,766 --> 03:15:58,583
I missed out on a lot of subs.

4743
03:15:58,583 --> 03:16:00,000
Hold on. Give me a second. Anything.

4744
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,166
You are the 100 bitties.

By the way, for people that don't know,

03:16:32,066 --> 03:16:32,700
I don't know.

4760
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:33,783
There's a video asking to be posted

4761
03:16:33,783 --> 03:16:36,300
there, and I should make a post
to be honest about it.

4762
03:16:36,483 --> 03:16:41,133
But I did make a proper intro video
because I felt like, OK.

4763
03:16:41,483 --> 03:16:44,516
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf isn't going to, like,
make sense for some people.

4764
03:16:44,516 --> 03:16:46,416
That's on that site. So yeah,

Home.

4781
03:17:33,366 --> 03:17:34,383
Now. We're just gone.

4782
03:17:34,383 --> 03:17:37,266
Pew, pew, pew.
And I'm having a great time doing that.

4783
03:17:38,666 --> 03:17:41,733
OK, let me see.

4784
03:17:43,466 --> 03:17:45,866
Match found.

4785
03:17:45,866 --> 03:17:49,566
Yet, right?

4786
03:17:49,566 --> 03:17:50,700
Oh, you go.

4787
03:17:51,366 --> 03:17:52,016
Oh, that's good.

03:17:52,016 --> 03:17:53,883
Are you. Buying guess?

4789
03:17:53,916 --> 03:17:55,283
Yeah. I was thinking about it.

4790
03:17:55,283 --> 03:17:57,833
Maybe after this second bind.

4791
03:17:58,466 --> 03:18:02,383
Uh, rain.

4792
03:18:02,583 --> 03:18:05,783
The rain? Mm.

4793
03:18:07,116 --> 03:18:10,083
Hmm. Oh.

4794
03:18:11,766 --> 03:18:14,633
I feel like sucking.

4795
03:18:14,633 --> 03:18:16,516
She does the suck

4796
03:18:17,250 --> 03:18:18,516
well, I'm right here.

4797
03:18:18,516 --> 03:18:20,583
Oh, whoa.

4798
03:18:20,766 --> 03:18:22,950
God. Is bald all offer. OK.

4799
03:18:23,583 --> 03:18:25,733
Let's get a smoker in.

4800
03:18:28,116 --> 03:18:29,100
Thank you for the smokes.

4801
03:18:29,100 --> 03:18:30,533
I appreciate it.

4802
03:18:33,233 --> 03:18:33,566
Yeah.

4803
03:18:33,683 --> 03:18:34,716
That's cool.

4804
03:18:35,016 --> 03:18:38,000
You know, Line-ups on the character.

4805
03:18:39,466 --> 03:18:39,816
All his.

4806
03:18:39,816 --> 03:18:42,266
Brim. Yeah, as brim.

4807
03:18:42,483 --> 03:18:43,833
There's Line-ups.

4808
03:18:43,833 --> 03:18:45,483
Oh, the model for the Molly.

4809
03:18:45,483 --> 03:18:47,466
Yeah, some are away.

4810
03:18:47,466 --> 03:18:48,650
And then just like

4811
03:18:49,433 --> 03:18:52,883
zap people if you're old, see, I think,

4812
03:18:52,883 --> 03:18:55,116
oh, they don't have smokes. OK.

4813
03:18:55,866 --> 03:18:58,166
Oh. I think we'll be

4814
03:18:58,166 --> 03:19:00,683
I might be in another job or team.

4815
03:19:00,683 --> 03:19:01,133
Looks better

4816
03:19:03,266 --> 03:19:04,350
yeah.

4817
03:19:05,066 --> 03:19:07,166
I don't know anything

4818
03:19:08,516 --> 03:19:09,450
I don't know any Line-ups.

4819
03:19:09,450 --> 03:19:11,583
I just check it chicken and pray.

4820
03:19:13,083 --> 03:19:13,916
You don't me to.

4821
03:19:13,916 --> 03:19:15,966
I wish I knew Line-ups on the.

4822
03:19:15,966 --> 03:19:19,733
I feel like I always watch a video,
but then I just don't absorb it.

4823
03:19:19,950 --> 03:19:22,350
This is a such a cute sticker.
What the. Hell?

4824
03:19:22,650 --> 03:19:24,733
You know how that one is, really?

4825
03:19:24,750 --> 03:19:26,516
So I bought it, and that's all right.

4826
03:19:26,516 --> 03:19:28,583
Before the battle pass ended.

4827
03:19:28,583 --> 03:19:33,833
I just realised I shot two at zero volume
from my last fumble for the game.

4828
03:19:34,183 --> 03:19:35,016
Fell out.

4829
03:19:35,016 --> 03:19:36,900
Oh, no, I'm.

4830
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:40,133
Yeah, I was asking you about, like, oh,
you ready?

4831
03:19:40,133 --> 03:19:42,750
And Final Fantasy, and then you just
didn't say anything, so I was like, oh.

4832
03:19:42,750 --> 03:19:47,116
My, me oh.

4833
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:51,900
I just heard violence, and I

4834
03:19:54,050 --> 03:19:57,616
oh, like, that is so great.

4835
03:19:58,833 --> 03:20:00,716
No wonder was so quiet else.

4836
03:20:00,716 --> 03:20:02,250
Like, so it's. Clear.

4837
03:20:02,250 --> 03:20:05,100
That's clear. I don't see anyone. Gardens.

4838
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:06,300
Oh, gone.

4839
03:20:10,266 --> 03:20:15,833
See the corner

4840
03:20:21,150 --> 03:20:23,383
we come.

4841
03:20:23,666 --> 03:20:25,133
Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness.

4842
03:20:25,133 --> 03:20:26,283
We saw

4843
03:20:26,916 --> 03:20:30,233
and head shot me we're sage
can be kidding.

4844
03:20:30,233 --> 03:20:31,766
She's telling the truth.

4845
03:20:31,766 --> 03:20:35,700
OK, you won't show me who

4846
03:20:37,083 --> 03:20:38,483
she did a running head shot.

4847
03:20:38,483 --> 03:20:39,683
What the fuck?

4848
03:20:39,816 --> 03:20:40,133
Oh, yeah.

4849
03:20:40,133 --> 03:20:42,450
To answer your question,
the earlier shelf.

4850
03:20:42,450 --> 03:20:45,166
All I did. I was it was at all.

4851
03:20:45,233 --> 03:20:50,183
Were you doing like, were you doing
pandemonium or reason like.

4852
03:20:50,216 --> 03:20:53,183
Yeah, pandemonium. Nice.

4853
03:20:53,183 --> 03:20:54,233
You just read my mind.

4854
03:20:54,233 --> 03:20:56,733
I need to do my deal. He's

4855
03:20:56,733 --> 03:20:59,466
still I only log on for me or not.

4856
03:20:59,466 --> 03:20:59,816
Dailies.

4857
03:20:59,816 --> 03:21:02,616
I mean, like, weekly reset stuff.

4858
03:21:03,716 --> 03:21:04,566
Yeah,

4859
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:07,416
that's pretty much the only thing I do.

4860
03:21:10,466 --> 03:21:11,916
They pick this.

4861
03:21:12,683 --> 03:21:14,850
I heard someone walk up there

4862
03:21:20,550 --> 03:21:22,950
and let's pick it together again.

4863
03:21:28,466 --> 03:21:30,983
OK? Why do you smoke

4864
03:21:36,866 --> 03:21:38,816
oh, down. Oh.

4865
03:21:38,816 --> 03:21:41,550
Spike down. Be nice.

4866
03:21:41,550 --> 03:21:43,266
And see anybody on set.

4867
03:21:43,266 --> 03:21:44,633
I should have looked that way.

4868
03:21:44,633 --> 03:21:45,183
Well,

4869
03:21:47,266 --> 03:21:47,666
it was on.

4870
03:21:47,666 --> 03:21:50,283
I'll play elbow on the left.

4871
03:21:50,633 --> 03:21:54,116
Oh, Dixie.

4872
03:21:54,483 --> 03:21:57,966
Next film I shot

4873
03:21:58,050 --> 03:22:00,033

4874
03:22:00,416 --> 03:22:03,266
You nice.

4875
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:04,466
Nice.

4876
03:22:07,116 --> 03:22:08,616
We got one enemy.

4877
03:22:08,616 --> 03:22:09,933
All was lost.

4878
03:22:09,933 --> 03:22:12,300
I like how you called it out for yourself.

4879
03:22:12,300 --> 03:22:12,900
Is. Just the case.

4880
03:22:12,900 --> 03:22:15,116
Mike died. I'm so used to dying.

4881
03:22:15,116 --> 03:22:16,733
I still go.

4882
03:22:16,866 --> 03:22:18,300
Ice. It.

4883
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:20,666
Normally, if I see something, it's like,
oh, no, I'm dead.

4884
03:22:20,666 --> 03:22:23,466
Who thought leave to me?

4885
03:22:23,550 --> 03:22:28,816
All of them up and.

03:22:32,050 --> 03:22:33,983
Just keep doing it, right? Yeah.

4888
03:22:33,983 --> 03:22:36,750
Good. Oh, I see. I love pussy tail.

4889
03:22:39,683 --> 03:22:40,533
Banana nose.

4890
03:22:40,533 --> 03:22:42,666
That's always the choice
between the pussy in the arse.

4891
03:22:43,016 --> 03:22:46,100
You're a I mean, you want oh.

4892
03:22:47,666 --> 03:22:49,316
Wow. Both of you are here.
