1
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,484
Maybe

2
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:23,268
I just.

3
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:30,004
Take my headphones off.

4
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,805
On. Give me a second

5
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,056
Hey, guys.

6
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:35,374
Good morning.

7
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:40,893
I actually woke up

8
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:43,861
and woke up pretty early today for once.

9
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:46,513
That's kind of surprising.

10
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,530
I didn't think I would wake up so.

11
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,431
Early today for a stream,
but I don't know.

12
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,300
I think I just had
I had a lot on my mind also.

13
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, yeah.

14
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,318
Does the

15
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:59,202
does the microphone sound OK?

16
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,753
I think some good.

17
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:03,004
So I sound fine.

18
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:03,905
So I sound OK.

19
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:07,657
I don't know, because I just hooked it up,
so I'm not sure if it's like

20
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,708
it's all good, like last time.

21
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,276
Sounds great. OK.

22
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:12,993
Nice.

23
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,111
Oh, sorry.

24
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,262
I was. What's it called?

25
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:23,765
We can get a lot of time necessary
to talk after the stream, but I was so

26
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,416
so tired after the collab.

27
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,218
I just wanted to hop off and go,

28
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:33,386
like, relax and eat some food.

29
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,971
So yeah, it was a lot of chaos and

30
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:39,539
very hectic and all over the place,
but I had so much fun.

31
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:42,641
So thank you guys for coming
by and supporting both of us.

32
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:44,758
Did I sleep well?

33
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:47,276
Yeah, I did sleep well.

34
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,078
I think I slept pretty early tonight too,

35
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,147
but I only got like 7 hours, but yeah.

36
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:54,747
Yeah,

37
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,582
it wasn't that. Much sleep, but I.

38
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:58,732
Still like.

39
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,367
I feel super refreshed, like more
so than usual.

40
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,319
So that's kind of crazy.

41
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,436
Hi, guys. Good morning.

42
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,087
Welcome, everybody.

43
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:09,988
Ah, good.

44
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:10,688
Good evening.

45
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,890
Yeah, good evening to some of you guys
because it's like,

46
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:17,141
I know it's Night-Time
for quite a few of you right now, right?

47
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:17,892
Yeah.

48
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,360
Also, I.

49
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,811
Did want to say.

50
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,528
We did.

51
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,529
Hit 300 K on the on switch.

52
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,731
Like not too long ago. I think we hit it.

53
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:31,832
Within one before stream started.

54
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,317
Or maybe yesterday. I don't know.

55
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,935
I just took a look.

56
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,869
Right now
because people are talking about it

57
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:43,438
and I was like,
Wow, we're already at 300 here.

58
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,839
So that's crazy.

59
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,008
And bronzer 400 on Twitter too.

60
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:53,610
So guys, that's fucking insane.

61
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,711
I mean, it's rigging.

62
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,012
That's like almost half a million.

63
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:03,214
And that's like really those are really
big numbers and they don't

64
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,666
it's it's scary.

65
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,717
It's, it's awesome.

66
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,417
But, you know, it's also scary.

67
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,468
But I know you guys understand, right?

68
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:12,819
Because it's like, it's a lot

69
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,538
it's a lot of people, but
I'm always excited to meet new people. So

70
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:21,057
I'll tell them, you guildies, I welcome
you with my open arms

71
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:24,308
and hope you're having a wonderful time
seeing here

72
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:27,927
congratulations. Thank you.

73
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,728
Thank you, guys.

74
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,529
Thank you so much.

75
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,513
That being said, I think.

76
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:35,647
I will have a. Karaoke.

77
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,732
Celebration next week to say

78
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,500
thank you to everybody for, you know,

79
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,552
just for all the support recently

80
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,521
and the fact that I haven't had
a, you know, karaoke in a while.

81
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,722
I wanted to sing a song.

82
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,357
No, not just a song.

83
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:57,725
I'll just sing many songs

84
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,492
next time we had a karaoke session.

85
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,327
So I think.

86
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:03,828
You can expect one probably be

87
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:06,846
next week and around like.

88
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,580
Friday.

89
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,865
Let's say maybe Friday or Saturday.

90
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,383
Yeah. Mm hmm.

91
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,700
So excited.

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,218
Me too. Dude, I'm so excited.

93
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:19,002
It's been a while
since we've gone to sing anything.

94
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,737
I really wanted to, you know,

95
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:27,090
I've even I've had, like, the what's it
the motivation to sing again recently.

96
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,508
So that's I've been just, like,
trying out different songs and stuff, but,

97
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,626
yeah, I want to

98
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,578
I want to do karaoke since we haven't done
one, you know, a bit.

99
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,511
And everybody's been doing.

100
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:42,697
Karaoke lately, so it's been kind of
inspiring me to also do some karaoke too.

101
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:43,514
Right.

102
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,968
Oh, yeah, right.

103
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,319
Did you guys want to.

104
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,169
Did you guys want to guess?

105
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:53,886
Hold on.

106
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,540
If you're so weird.

107
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,842
Going back for, like,
was it kissing the ear on the microphone?

108
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,677
I'm still trying to get used to it, but.

109
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:11,045
Uh. I'll get there eventually.

110
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:15,747
Like, one of these days,
it'll feel a natural, and, you know,

111
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:18,282
you'll feel good.

112
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:20,400
Yeah, you'll feel really good.

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,601
Like, it's right if you're not good, but

114
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,169
you'll feel right and I'm doing it
correctly.

115
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,103
That's why. That's when I'm nervous.

116
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,854
Because Not feel.

117
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:30,221
Good. Yeah.

118
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,122
That's the wrong word.

119
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,573
That's the wrong word to use.

120
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,357
Okay, hold on.

121
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,941
Let me give another kiss.

122
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:43,911
To OK,

123
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,798
But hopefully everyone's
been having a great weekend so far.

124
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,799
I have a lot.

125
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,550
To do today and tomorrow.

126
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,551
So your boys can be quite busy.

127
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,685
Um. Could you write?

128
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,919

Thank you for the congratulations
to see Sadie.

140
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:33,003
Thank you for the five months, five months
since one feels like just yesterday

141
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:35,287
when I found you wondering
because of mortuary assistant.

142
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,289
I'm glad to know that you've been.

143
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,572
Around for that long zero

00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:43,474
it and you've been enjoying my consent
since, you know, five months ago.

145
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:45,392
That's almost half a year.

146
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,760
Have you been having fun?

147
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,261
It's been fun, right?

148
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:54,263
Also, just thank you for the 10,000
bits as well.

149
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,981
Just thank you for the 10,000. Oh, my God.

150
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,182
Hope you're having a great day too.

151
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,199
Good morning.

152
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:03,601
And Kimura, thank you for the Jono
Pavi thing for the eight months.

153
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,603
Dear Linh, thank you for the dono
and the 10th year and give subs

154
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:09,037
around thing for the donation as well.

155
00:10:09,838 --> 00:10:10,771
Shuttle. Woof, woof,

156
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,239
woof, woof.

157
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,291
Thank you for the donation.

158
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,842
Best part of every day is hearing
your voice.

159
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:22,594
My exact anxiety would break down
disappear in the short period of time

160
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,795
or two.

161
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,962
Or really.

162
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,247
That's so sweet.

163
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:30,365
I'm glad.

164
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,132
I don't know. It's just like.

165
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:36,418
I guess I understand
because there are like some things I do

166
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:42,120
to, you know, relax and just take away
the anxiety from a long, hard day.

167
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,989
But I could never imagine, like,
my voice or, like, just me talking

168
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:51,308
or just me being here and talking to you
guys would be enough to help that much.

169
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:52,959
It's like

170
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:56,311
it's really cool to know, like,

171
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,796
I don't know, just my presence

172
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:02,914
or me doing
this has a healing effect on you guys,

173
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:07,683
and it just makes me feel so much better
about myself.

174
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:12,002
And makes me feel so much better about,
you know, doing what I'm doing right now.

175
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,770
So thank you. Really?

176
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:15,487
I don't.

177
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,455
I don't get to hear that enough from,
like, anybody.

178
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:21,340
So thank you.

179
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,108
So I feel like the.

180
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:23,758
Hold on.

181
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:24,358
Give me a.

182
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,325
Second.

183
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:28,777
Like, this might be too high.

184
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,511
I'll bring it down lower.

185
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,029
It might be better.

186
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:32,612
Yeah.

187
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:36,031
That's good enough.

188
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,132
OK. OK.

189
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:40,466
Oh, wait.

190
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,334
Is the music still on?

191
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,418
Oh, wait.

192
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:45,452
I just realised. Oh, my God.

193
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,620
I just realised the music was still on.

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,054
Holy shit.

195
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,222
I guess I took off my headphones.

196
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:54,507
I forgot my Spotify was open.

197
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,992
So I just let my Spotify keep going.

198
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,142
On and all.

199
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:02,427
Until somebody in chat told me like,
Oh, it's still on.

200
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,695
OK, thank you for telling me.

201
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:06,546
Oh my God. OK,

202
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:08,730
I appreciated Hopefully we don't get our

203
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,782
I don't get TMZ from that. Hmm.

204
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,551
OK, all right.

205
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,602
So is everything good now?

206
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,053
And he's fine.

207
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,820
You guys can hear me.

208
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,721
It's just me and you.

209
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,289
There's no music now. Right.

210
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:32,859
I think this is better OK.

211
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:39,696
Oh. Sorry.

212
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:40,380
Excuse me.

213
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,664
That's like, hold back a sneeze.

214
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,299
As hold it back because, like,

215
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,317
I don't know, like, sneeze into your ears
or whatever.

216
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,452
That sounds really gross and loud
appearing

217
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,570
under you
for the two to one gift subs. And

218
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:57,305
anything for the five to one.

219
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:59,973
I guess I'm still interviewing
for the Don on Anthony.

220
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:01,707
Thank you for that tone. Yeah.

221
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,325
Could you close your eyes
so I can kiss you on your face?

222
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,944
I mean, if you want to.

223
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,578
OK, come dark.

224
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:13,896
Come here then.

225
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:16,114
I. I guess

226
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,116
Did you do it yet?

227
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:21,850
Did you.

228
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,218
Did you do it yet?

229
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,869
Hello? Did you.

230
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:27,003
Did you do it

231
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:28,287
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,671
I guess you. Did it

233
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,573
Also, Gracie, you are not.

234
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,674
Allowed to dono our dude.

235
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:40,526
My mods are like the last people I feel
like should be donating to me right now.

236
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:43,061
But I got it.

237
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:44,712
Congrats on three, bro.

238
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:46,479
Today marks one year
since I first followed you.

239
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,630
Thank you for your smiles,
loss, and good times.

240
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,748
I appreciate you beyond words.

241
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,365
I'm so glad to have found this community.

242
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:54,116
One treat yourself. I will.

243
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,650
Oh, God.

244
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,651
Guys, mods.

245
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,019
You can't do this. Roll

246
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,570
You can just

247
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:04,438
do so much.
You don't need to give anything.

248
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,857
If anything, I feel like I should be
giving to you guys because you guys keep.

249
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,525
You know,
you help out so much in the back,

250
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,126
during the streams,
and, like, for the server.

251
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,911
I guess you shouldn't be doing that.

252
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:17,645
For real.

253
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,496
But thank you so much for the downloads.

254
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,931
It means a lot. Just please.

255
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:25,565
You. It make me feel better if you use.

256
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,467
This money to, like, treat yourself

257
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,935
rather than me to myself, if anything.

258
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,170
So please. Just No more.

259
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,187
No more of that. All right?

260
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:40,089
And that goes for each
and every one of my months.

261
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,941
Like, I'm watching you guys.

262
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,058
Ash, thank you for the donation.

263
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,359
Congrats on the work you've been doing.

264
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,544
So long,
given so much support to the guilties,

265
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,278
you absolutely deserve so much love.

266
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:52,579
Hope you have a good time in a weekend.

267
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,880
I will have a great weekend.

268
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,330
Thank you, guys.

269
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,482
And I also have a great stream.

270
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,700
Oh. All right, well, um,

271
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,219
I did a.

272
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:07,720
I did have some prompts written up.

273
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,770
Not a lot.

274
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,789
I might repeat one of the problems
from last time, too, because I felt like,

275
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,441
you know, it was such a good prompt
and it was, like, super comforting.

276
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:19,442
So I thought,
why not? I'll take a, like, a,

277
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,060
I'll do a redo of it

278
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,211
or like, you know, just try it again.

279
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,430
With more effort

280
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,281
this time since I'm, like,
a little bit more confident now.

281
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:33,599
I don't know. Right.

282
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,817
I have one prompts here.

283
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,385
That's like,

284
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:41,337
Oh, I just got home from work
and you're worried about me

285
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,105
and we're about to cuddle
or something like that.

286
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,156
And then there's another one that's.

287
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,490
I, I don't think.

288
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,626
I want to do this one because, like,
I was writing it last night

289
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,727
before I went to bed,
and I was kind of sleepy

290
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:59,279
The thing about this prompt
is that it has.

291
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,747
It's like sub dog boy.

292
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:04,715
Um, and I call you master

293
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,766
and I don't think I want to do that.

294
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,100
Just for.

295
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:10,918
How about this? How this

296
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:16,387
if if somebody

297
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:17,104
Oh, my God.

298
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:19,689
I know if somebody. Gives 50 subs.

299
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,223
I'll. I'll do that.

300
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,024
The the dog.

301
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,559
Boy one bite

302
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,676
a little later.

303
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,660
Yeah, I'll do a little later.

304
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:31,745
It's just.

305
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,513
Really, I don't know.

306
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:36,331
It's like when I write these late
at night, it's,

307
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:40,683
I don't realise it's like when you draw
or when you do work at Night-Time, right.

308
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,951
And you wake up the next day
and then you look at it or like

309
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,586
one more time you look at it one more time
and you're like wait this is a mistake.

310
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:51,788
I shouldn't have done this or like,
oh, this looks so bad.

311
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:54,423
Or like, you know,

312
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,242
you kind of like pull back
and want to like fix it, but

313
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,260
Yeah, but I feel about this one right now.

314
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,595
I have another one
that's kind of like Gouda inspired

315
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,763
because, like,
she did this on her steam one time.

316
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:08,647
It was like some kind of Cinderella thing.

317
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,198
So I thought, should not be fun.

318
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,032
Yeah.

319
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,501
Never a mistake.

320
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,952
What do you mean,

321
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,956
it's just super, and.

322
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,840
It's really, really embarrassing, dude.

323
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,624
Like,

324
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,325
it's.

325
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,344
There's so much here that I feel like.

326
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,979
Oh, it's.

327
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,247
It's so embarrassing.

328
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,998
I only ever get even stomach
doing this one.

329
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:50,468
Even even if I did reach that goal.

330
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:52,119
Okay, I'm going to.

331
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,486
I'm going to. I'm

332
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:54,903
yeah.

333
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,671
We'll all look back. On that later,
though.

334
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:57,755
We'll look back on that later.

335
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:59,889
Maybe I'll feel okay about it.

336
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:03,508
Oh, Mitzi, thank you for the five.

337
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,075
Thank you for the 50.

338
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:06,693
Congrats on the educate.

339
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,427
You deserve every single number
and more. The shrooms.

340
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,928
Also the perfect time for me.

341
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:11,912
Shelia, since it's almost 11 p.m..

342
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:12,962
Here, I'm glad I get.

343
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:16,831
To do these kinds of things for everybody
when they're, you know, about

344
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,732
to sleep in the other side of the world.

345
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:24,451
Since I do feel like, you know, for the
past year plus, I've only been ever been

346
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:26,953
streaming

347
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,337
for, like, one time zone.

348
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:33,189
So getting to, you know, to a little bit
more for other time zones is nice.

349
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,658
Alright, thank you for the donations
and thank you for your content.

350
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:40,176
Thank you for existing

351
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:43,911
also.

352
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:47,730
Thank you for the donations Hill. OK,

353
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,049
are you kidding me?

354
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,450
Are you kidding me?

355
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,818
Guys, guys,

356
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,203
well,

357
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,588
guys,

358
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:07,840
oh, my God.

359
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,707
Both of you.

360
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:11,642
Both of you like.

361
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,560
OK, I guess

362
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:23,498
Oh, see, I didn't think of it.

363
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:25,349
Of course it's course hidden.

364
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:27,416
Or is it do it tell. And look here.

365
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,250
Thank you both for.

366
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,751
50 from each of you.

367
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,036
OK, fine. I'll do it.

368
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:33,986
I'll do it.

369
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:35,254
I'll just

370
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:39,306
call and let me just put it back
in the document real quick

371
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,557
because I got rid of it

372
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,959
because I was so
sure I wasn't going to do that one. But.

373
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,693
All right.

374
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,827
No, you guys prove me wrong

375
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,145
every time you guys prove me
wrong on anything.

376
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:55,330
You for the five artsy ones as well. OK,

377
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,666
Well down, guys.

378
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,167
God damn

379
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:06,402
I don't know what it is

380
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:09,971
about the dog boy
that gets everyone riled up,

381
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,573
but ok, I'll try my best
when we get there.

382
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:14,673
All right.

383
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,474
Just do it now.

384
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:18,759
You guys just want me to do it now
so I could get out of the way.

385
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,994
It's like ripping off a bandage, right?

386
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,528
It's like when you rip off a bandage.

387
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:26,613
It's my as well,
so I don't have to, like, do it later.

388
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,630
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,200
Hold on.

390
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,517
OK. Through the ears.

391
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,038
Jesus.

392
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,241
Puppy.

393
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:53,559
Yeah, puppy. It's puppy.

394
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,511
OK, I got a dog into the puppy mindset
right now.

395
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:57,328
Yes, I can

396
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,181
I am dog.

397
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:08,317
I am talking and talking and talking
like Oh.

398
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,319
Oh, oh, oh.

399
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:15,420
But I agree to this.

400
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,471
What compelled me to do this,
I don't know.

401
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:19,689
See, this is.

402
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,757
I don't. Trust.

403
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,308
I don't trust. One.

404
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:29,277
A thought shop or two to do like a proper
job at, you know, thinking properly.

405
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:31,745
OK, let's just get into it.

406
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:41,250
Hey. Hey, master.

407
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,552
Hey. Master.

Come on.

416
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,183
I know you're awake.

417
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,952
Come on.

418
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,036
Get up.

Don't ignore me.

Are you going to make me breakfast?

434
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:47,146
Are we going for a walky?

I was like I was digging.

I don't know what to say to that.

517
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,527
What the fuck did I do? Huh?

518
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:10,411
What the fuck was that?

00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:10,811

I don't think I'll ever do that again.

00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:11,642
I don't think I'll ever do that
ever again.

538
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:14,109
OK, I'm taking the talking yourself. OK,
that's enough.

539
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:14,877
They're gone.

540
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,128
I don't know who that was.
I know who I was.

541
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,178
That wasn't me.

542
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:19,262
That was not though.

543
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:22,047
That was a something else.

544
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:25,749
Uh, Maggie, thank you for this honour.

545
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,200
I'd say back what I had said. Dog boy.

546
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,917
It's scary.

547
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,018
I'm foster children.

548
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:32,585
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,386

Thank you for that. Done as well.

Thank you for the five to ones as well.

557
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:53,429
The man

558
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,648
uh. Guys, guys.

559
00:29:58,232 --> 00:29:59,199
Guys.

560
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,901
Uh, that didn't happen.

561
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:06,119
OK, that's.
But that's between. Me and you.

562
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,453
That was Dylan's between me
and you guys are.

563
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:12,072
Don't that don't so don't tell anyone else

564
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:15,157
about what we just did today, ok?

565
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:20,409
What what happens in the stream
stays in this stream.

566
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,778
What you guys heard
and what you guys know.

567
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,279
It's like it's like forbidden knowledge.

568
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:29,581
You keep it here, ok?

569
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,798
We don't we don't tell anybody
else. We don't talk about it.

570
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,734
You know
that song like we don't talk about Bruno.

571
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,568
Yeah, it's exactly like that.

572
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,702
Just don't talk about it, OK?

573
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:41,436
Just don't talk about it.

574
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,689
I'll bite your hand off

575
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:52,859
oh, god damn, bro.

576
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,761
Stupid soul.

577
00:30:56,944 --> 00:31:01,930
So stupid. OK.

578
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:09,117
Well, I'm.

579
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,451
I'm flustered now.

580
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,320
I'm I'm really flustered
from whatever just happened.

581
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,737
So my my brain is kind of like

582
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:18,788
broken.

583
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:22,207
I'm like, I'm like,
mind break tagged it at the moment.

584
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,941
You guys, the guilties.

585
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:26,009
I've have mine break tagged me

586
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,310
and it's only been l how long is it.

587
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,662
It's only been 30 minutes.

588
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:34,029
Unlucky, dude, unlucky

589
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:39,832

that is cringe kill the part that cringes.

594
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:57,224
am I practise blowing.

595
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,492
Yeah I can blow

596
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,076
like blow.

597
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:05,528
Into blow into your ear not you know you

598
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:10,898
you know I can try again
but I don't think it's

599
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:15,117
I don't think it's going to go too
well I'll try Lleyton Murray.

600
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:15,717
No, maybe.

601
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:16,451
I don't know

602
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:19,535
it it's so obvious.

603
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:20,169
Why be embarrassed.

604
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:22,170
I really admire your bravery
and confidence.

605
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,154
Thank you.

606
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:27,539
It takes confidence to be somebody's
dog. Boy

607
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,459
or puppy boy, whatever you call it.

608
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,860
OK. Oh.

609
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,261
Well, that's done.

610
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,031
I let me see.

611
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,164
Let me check something.

612
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:46,899
I do want to try something

613
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,033
as well.

614
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,118
Like, I'm
going to go through like a string of words

615
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,219
or like a string of phrases

616
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:57,238
and try to, you know, bring some comfort

617
00:32:57,238 --> 00:33:01,406
to people that might feel
a little doubtful of themselves.

618
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:05,759
Or maybe there are some days where
you just feel like you can't I don't know.

619
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,727
You feel like you have a

620
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:11,762
lot of answer on not
you have a lot of expectations.

621
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:14,980
And, you know, sometimes you just don't

622
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,797
want to

623
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:20,433
it's sometimes it's too much, right?

624
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:25,685
There's a lot of expectations on everybody
and it can be so heavy.

625
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,270
And I understand that so

626
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,438
I guess this is like my little thing
for people

627
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:34,706
that have so much on their shoulders
and they are

628
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,141
they don't know what to do,

629
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:38,892
I guess.

630
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,026
So hold on.

631
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,132
Can you hear that?

632
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,866
Yeah, OK.

633
00:33:55,017 --> 00:33:55,800
All right.

634
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,938
Yeah, it's cuddle time.

635
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:08,290
You want to call it that?

636
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,090
It's cuddle time.

637
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,807
Sure.

638
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,159
Yeah, my heart is beating fast.

639
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,027
I'm embarrassed, dude.

640
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:23,164
You're doing great.

641
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:25,799
I believe in you.

642
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,067
You're doing your best.

643
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:30,418
And I'm.

644
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,902
I'm really proud of you.

645
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,237
That's it.

646
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:51,461
And you guys can hear me swallow, too.

647
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:53,496
I hope that's not embarrassing.
I don't know.

648
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:57,098
Can you hear me? Swallow, huh?

649
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,082
I never thought about that.

650
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:11,438
It's OK.

651
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:14,373
It's OK.

652
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,041
Everything will be OK.

653
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:21,460
I'm so, so proud of you.

654
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:24,361
You're going to do amazing.

655
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:27,746
I'll be here with you all the way

656
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:30,031
murder's OK.

657
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,232
You can do it.

658
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,067
And don't worry, I'll stay by your side

659
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,751
till the very end.

660
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,393
I couldn't help myself.

661
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:55,410
I had to say it.

662
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,211
I couldn't help myself.

663
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:07,633
It's like that one.

664
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,484
Mean, you know,

665
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,735
guys, I'm like, this is.

666
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,386
I'm like a whole package, OK?

667
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:14,736
Just remember that.

668
00:36:14,736 --> 00:36:15,187
You can't.

669
00:36:15,187 --> 00:36:17,671
You get, like, the mirror and you get the,

670
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:21,990
you know, the soft side,
so you got a yardstick.

671
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,991
Take it for what it is. Boys and girls.

672
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:35,230
OK, you

673
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,364
can do it.

674
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:40,049
Keep moving for it.

675
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:40,833
All right.

676
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,634
I got your back

677
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:45,268
you'll succeed.

678
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:46,769
I know you will.

679
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:48,303
Trust me.

680
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,456
You're beautiful.

681
00:36:56,107 --> 00:36:58,025
And you shine brighter than the stars

682
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:00,493
and the moons in the sky.

683
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:14,133
I believe in you.

684
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:21,603
OK, I'm

685
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:22,970
proud of. You.

686
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:48,900
Oh, yeah, OK.

687
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,535
Yeah, I know. My heart break.

688
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,786
My heart rate is high.

689
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:57,071
I'm just nervous.

690
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:01,173
I'm just really nervous, that's all.

691
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:03,874
All right.

692
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:06,092
That's enough.

693
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,893
Get off my chest now.

694
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,297
I hope that was good.

695
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:18,398
I ah.

696
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:21,416
I just want to try something
akin to, like, you know,

697
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:25,568
a nice hug, a nice cuddle

698
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:30,387
and having somebody there
to tell you you're doing great.

699
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:32,672
And you're doing OK.

700
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:34,056
All right, all right.

701
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:41,543
So we drink more tea.

702
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:49,047
Tim, thank you for the.

703
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:50,081
Oh, thank you for the doll. No,

704
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:55,116
and Nancy, thank you for the towel.

705
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,701
No. Is well,

706
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:58,952
straight out crying right now.

707
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:01,620
No, you can go. Please don't cry.

708
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,070
Nauseated. Don't worry.

709
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,638
All of you are doing great. Trust me.

710
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:07,890
I don't know what kind of battles each

711
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,841
and every one of you have and

712
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:13,209
that's why I want to talk about, like,

713
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:17,311
a lot of time, I try to go into a mindset
that you don't know anybody.

714
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,062
I don't know you.

715
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,262
You don't know me.

716
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:23,397
And, like, we have a lot going on

717
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:26,882
behind what we show everybody else, right?

718
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:29,884
And so you guys are better at lying

719
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:34,169
than other people and, like, hiding,
you know, what you're going through.

720
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,987
So for those of you that are, like,

721
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,356
hiding that
I don't know what you got going on, but

722
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,841
it's like a little

723
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:47,559
message for me to say,
hey, you got this, OK?

724
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,627
I don't know what you're going through.

725
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:53,979
But I feel like you'll be able to do it

726
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:58,498
because you're my guild members.

727
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,132
I believe in you.

728
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,917
You're here at the Avengers
Guild for a reason, right?

729
00:40:03,717 --> 00:40:04,768
I don't know.

730
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,753
I don't think my guilds or whatever,
you know,

731
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,921
gets get overtaken by a small challenge.

732
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:17,341
So I have more faith in
you guys than they might think.

733
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,643
Some other people might think

734
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:22,894
of you.

735
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:25,378
Thank you for the donation as well.

736
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:27,546
Do you remember the song Before
I Close My Eyes?

737
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:32,132
All right.

738
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:34,349
I still can't believe you remember that.

739
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:34,866
Hold on.

740
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,117
Do I remember?

741
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,302
you want me to humm it?

742
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,705
I think I remember how it goes.

743
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,807
Hmm. Hmm, hmm

744
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:53,542
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

745
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:57,961
hmm hmm hmm.

746
00:40:58,862 --> 00:40:59,645
It's an odd song.

747
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:02,530
It's like it repeats the same melody over
and over again.

748
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,266
Name it down to sleep.

749
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,467
I pray Lord my soul to keep.

750
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,719
I hope it's not too late for me.

751
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:17,021
Yeah, I think it goes like that.

752
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,972
Mm hmm.

753
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,623
Changing in the heart.

754
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:22,940
Then come

755
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,942
hmm. Yeah.

756
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,376
It's been awhile.

757
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,944
Isn't it an old one?

758
00:41:29,944 --> 00:41:31,561
I can't believe you remember that.

759
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,195
Yeah.

760
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:36,180
It's been so long since ever since I sang
anything related to that, but, hey,

761
00:41:36,781 --> 00:41:38,848
that's really. It's really nice, dude.

762
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:40,182
Thanks for reminding me.

763
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:44,068
I used to like it a lot more back
then than I do now, I guess.

764
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,602
But you know,
you grow out of certain songs.

765
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:50,104
You really do. And

766
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,739
I know now I'm listening to a bunch of

767
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,124
a bunch of ki pop and rock,

768
00:41:57,124 --> 00:42:00,492
and I'd say an R&B

769
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:07,663
my music tastes
change a lot over the years.

770
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,097
It happens, right?

771
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:09,280
Yeah.

772
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,297
Happens

773
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,968
you'll miss hum Isabel's lullaby.

774
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:19,652
Oh, is it.

775
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:22,637
Is that the one that's from a

776
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:26,172
that's the one from Promised Neverland.

777
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:26,706
Right.

778
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:27,539
Hold on.

779
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,125
How did he go again?

780
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:33,609
Fuck.

781
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:35,610
It's been so long
since I've watched The Enemy.

782
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:38,828
You kind of went like.

783
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:42,914
Hmm hmm hmm

784
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:46,599
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

785
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,067
hmm hmm.

786
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:54,770
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

787
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,521
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

788
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:01,823
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

789
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:07,476
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

790
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,362
It was like that, and I don't remember the
rest for some reason.

791
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:13,296
Yeah,

792
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,464
it's been
a long time since I've watched it.

793
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:19,299
It's a it was a great anime.

794
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,866
I love the the first arc of that series.

795
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,151
It's really beautiful.

796
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,719
Yeah, that lullaby is.

797
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,837
I'm. I can't continue.

798
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:30,938
I don't know how to. Continue, though.

799
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:33,272
I don't know how to continue.

800
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:34,956
That's been.

801
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:36,357
I don't know.

802
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:38,608
And, uh, you brought you.

803
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:41,460
Bring back a lot of memories
about the show, though, so

804
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:49,180
I'm not karaoke stream, by the way, guys,
so I don't the

805
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,932
I can sing anything,
but I can, you know, just do a little bit

806
00:43:58,085 --> 00:43:58,652
Hold on.

807
00:43:58,652 --> 00:43:59,435
I think,

808
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:02,670
I think some people want more,
more attention

809
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,438
so give me a sec.

810
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:17,661
How Oh, yeah,

811
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:19,862
yeah.

812
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:27,416
Yeah.

813
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:41,556
Oh, uh,

814
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:53,312

00:44:54,896 --> 00:45:00,799
mm well.

816
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:12,088
Wow. Mm

OK. Oh, oh.

OK, oh.

821
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:01,563
It's.

822
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,998
Just not there because my lips,
my lips are going to, you know, to what

823
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:07,933
your young will, to what

824
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,403
I really hope
the Iraqis sound good to you guys.

825
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:15,236
Like,

826
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,988
I've been trying my best
to find the right spots,

827
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:22,023
and hopefully I'm hitting the right spots

828
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:23,107
for that.

829
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:25,692
You know what they say.

830
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:27,959
Practise makes perfect. Yeah.

831
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,343
Or practise

832
00:46:31,928 --> 00:46:32,528
more.

833
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:33,779
Thank you for the donation.

834
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:37,264
Today's or one month
anniversary of liking you

836

and the donation is well and mincey.

837
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,070
Thank you for the demo.

838
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,120
Glad you found my strings.

839
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,821
You thank you for being so amazingly kind.

840
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:54,089
And so the voices. So call me as well.

841
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:57,341
I'm glad
that you find comfort in these times

842
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:01,826
when we do get like a moment like this
and it's not like all the time chaotic

843
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:07,863
and yelling when we play like overcooked
or a whale or like it takes two or.

844
00:47:08,046 --> 00:47:09,480
I don't know. Something

845
00:47:10,564 --> 00:47:12,365
where I am like

846
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:14,433
balls to the walls, you know,

847
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:19,752
I'm glad I get to have moments like this
so you guys can just chill back.

848
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:22,087
And I can also chill back since I'm

849
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:24,755
I don't want to.

850
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:25,438
Oh, no.

851
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:28,656
I want to be,
you know, yelling all the time,

852
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:32,742
like, loud all the time.

853
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:35,910
I enjoy my quiet
I feel like everyone enjoys their quiet.

854
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,228
So it's nice to take some time
like this and

855
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:42,547
embrace some solace once in a while.

856
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,299
And that's what we're doing right now.

857
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:49,017
Just enjoying some moments of solace

858
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:54,336
also I'm running out of tea.

859
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:57,071
T Oh, my God, bro, I'm running out of tea.

860
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,522
Ahh.

861
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,040
I think

862
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:06,509
I just drank too much earlier on
because I was nervous

863
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,610
from the Dog Boy stuff.

864
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:12,545
I think

865
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:16,347
there is another prompt.

866
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:17,081
Yeah.

867
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:18,031
Here we go.

868
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:21,216
There's another prompter

869
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:23,734
I did want to try out.

870
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,435
It's not very on

871
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:29,337
ASMR leaning, but

872
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:32,288
it's like Cinderel.

873
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:34,890
It's kind of cinderell

874
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,909
because I saw a video

875
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:42,160
of someone doing something like this
and I was like, oh,

876
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:44,011
I'm going to try this

877
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:48,546
so I guess I'll give it a try.

878
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:49,597
Oh, God, yeah.

879
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:50,731
Oh, God.

880
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:57,251
OK, give me a second.

881
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,218
OK, I'll put on the face

882
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:02,820
I mean, there's a way to find the face.

883
00:49:03,237 --> 00:49:04,171
Check it on.

884
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:06,939
Cut off. OK,

885
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,891
how do I approach this

886
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:14,443
without embarrassing myself? OK.

887
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,078
Oh, a simply, I didn't know.

888
00:49:19,078 --> 00:49:21,246
You walk this way.

889
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:24,181
Oh, I'm very in front of your house, huh?

890
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:26,682
Oh, no, I.

891
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:30,451
I wasn't looking at it
or looking for you or anything.

892
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,751
I just.

893
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,503
I happened to be walking by
and and I noticed

894
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,721
Mark, I was, like, walking by,

895
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,740
but. OK, OK, fine.

896
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:43,957
The truth is.

897
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,992
I wanted to give you something.

898
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:51,661
Listen, don't get. Me wrong,
but I was just up till two. A.m.

899
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:53,112
making lunch for school today.

900
00:49:53,112 --> 00:49:53,862
And I know.

901
00:49:53,862 --> 00:49:56,847
Hamburgers steak just happens
to be your favourite, and I was making.

902
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:59,615
Some, and I want to know if you would like
some, and I had extra.

903
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,317
Be grateful.

904
00:50:02,317 --> 00:50:04,868
Like, OK.

905
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:09,087

906
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:12,038

00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:18,758
That's it.

909
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:21,359
Ah. Oh.

910
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,811
I don don't look at me.

911
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:25,528
You did.

912
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:33,215
And my.

913
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:34,566
Ears are so red.

914
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:36,567
My ears are so fucking red from that.

915
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,718
You guys have no idea.

916
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:39,002
My face is so hot.

917
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,219
I am. I'm flustered beyond imagine.

918
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:42,820
How did that get
me more. Flustered than. The.

919
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:51,008
Jesus are. The.

920
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:55,060
The screaming.

921
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,378
Yeah you know, it's it's it's called
you got to put in some.

922
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:03,664
An embarrassment factor so I like a

923
00:51:04,114 --> 00:51:06,148
got to be flustered.

924
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:11,701
Shut up.

925
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:15,336
Don't look at me shut up.

926
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:16,537
Don't, don't look at me.

927
00:51:16,537 --> 00:51:18,521
Don't, don't look at me.

928
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,107
I'm just kidding

929
00:51:23,107 --> 00:51:24,958
you can look at me if you want

930
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:31,811
but since some people asked

931
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:34,513
yeah you can listen but

932
00:51:46,952 --> 00:51:49,687
I don't know if, like, people ever

933
00:51:50,971 --> 00:51:52,572
to just, like, a stream of thought.

934
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:54,990
Like,
they put the microphone up to their heart.

935
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,457
It's like, oh, poor me,

936
00:51:58,508 --> 00:51:59,592
you've had a bad day.

937
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:02,043
And I'm coddling you in brackets.

938
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:03,777
You're laying on my chest and can hear my.

939
00:52:03,777 --> 00:52:05,461
Heart rate or heartbeat.

940
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:06,062
Yeah,

941
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,665
you know, I mean, bro,

942
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:15,717
you know what I mean? Did.

943
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:16,000
Yeah.

944
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:18,718
Gail Foster.

945
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,385
Yeah, I did.

946
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:20,669
Stop sobs.

947
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:23,821
You don't have. To say it like that.

948
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:25,888
If you want to say it like that.

949
00:52:25,888 --> 00:52:36,510
Just going to call me out OK?

950
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,531
Oh, that's really stuff on YouTube.

951
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,949
Wow. Really?

952
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:47,633
That's really cute.

953
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:50,367
Did I know about that?

954
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:56,337
OK, this next prompt that I wanted to try

955
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:00,039
leaned along the lines of

956
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:01,890
what's it

957
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:06,659
as opposed to last time.

958
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,276
It's more like

959
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:11,528
this time I'm going to.

960
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:13,712
It's it's.

961
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:14,763
Something similar.

962
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:18,598
It's something similar, right? So

963
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:20,699
just more wholesome shit.

964
00:53:21,183 --> 00:53:22,166
Something more wholesome.

965
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,535
Again, nothing lewd,
just only wholesome vibes.

966
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,854
Derrick song
but no, I don't believe in that.

967
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:31,738
Say so. It's not real to me.

968
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:34,273
I firmly believe Say So is a cult.

969
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:36,941
It doesn't exist

970
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:38,708
everybody.

971
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,559
Everybody is lewd to a degree.

972
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:46,145
Even the most special person

973
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:48,896
you might have, you might have seen right

974
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:53,682
especially me.

975
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:57,034
What OK,

976
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,819
so let me see.

977
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:02,820
What are we doing now?

978
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:05,888
Give me a second.

979
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:07,322
I'm looking for it.

980
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,691
OK, here it is.

981
00:54:19,262 --> 00:54:23,097
OK, oh, boy.

982
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:25,348
Oh, boy.

983
00:54:25,415 --> 00:54:26,432
Oh, boy.

984
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:28,616
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

985
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:31,868
Only time, only time.

986
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,719
Only time.

987
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:36,153
On their time. On their time.

988
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,537
On their time, on their time.

989
00:54:37,537 --> 00:54:40,806
I mean, sister on me is our brother right?

990
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:46,892
When my friends are, I was like, chilling.

991
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,760
Chilling off each one of them.

992
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,428
And I kind of brought it up

993
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:56,397
and they were telling me to say it
in like in different ways.

994
00:54:56,847 --> 00:54:58,648
And one of their favourites was like

995
00:54:58,648 --> 00:55:02,216
when I did it in like a questioning
tone, like I think those.

996
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,086
All on that song,

997
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:08,520
on that song,

998
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:10,988
on that song.

999
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:13,205
Oh, I need some.

1000
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:14,022
Like in it yeah.

1001
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:17,974
Like asking them something
or like asking something from them.

1002
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,526
It's like a,

1003
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:21,760
I don't know.

1004
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:26,495
I don't know what the appeal of it was.

1005
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:33,632
OK, oh, OK.

1006
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:36,117
I think I'm good to try this one out.

1007
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:39,819
Oh boy, oh boy.

1008
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:40,836
Oh, boy.

1009
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:52,408
Oh. Hey, baby.

1010
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:56,277
Sorry I got back home a little late

1011
00:55:58,378 --> 00:55:59,128
where can we stay?

1012
00:55:59,128 --> 00:56:02,280
A little longer than I wanted to, but

1013
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:05,381
I brought back some ice cream
as an apology gift.

1014
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:11,951
Oh. Is everything OK?

1015
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:17,587
I didn't make you sad or anything, did I?

1016
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:20,105
Did I worry you again?

1017
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:24,091
Oh, sorry, honey.

1018
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,609
You know how busy I am.

1019
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:30,511
It's not easy, but

1020
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:32,195
I promise I'm not overdoing it.

1021
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:34,896
I just.

1022
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:37,447
I really
want to impress my co-workers, and

1023
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:41,049
I want to make you happy till.

1024
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:49,437
I mean it.

1025
00:56:50,337 --> 00:56:52,772
Yeah, I mean it.

1026
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,773
Don't sell yourself so much silly.

1027
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:59,492
I want nothing more than to come home

1028
00:56:59,975 --> 00:57:03,327
as soon as possible to my darling

1029
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:18,301
oh, come here and cuddle me, OK?

1030
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:23,554
That's it.

1031
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:25,738
That's it.

1032
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:26,555
Yeah.

1033
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:33,492
How'd you sleep today?

1034
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:35,376
Yeah.

1035
00:57:35,376 --> 00:57:39,095
I wish I got a little more chill,
but it doesn't help.

1036
00:57:39,095 --> 00:57:40,712
I had a nightmare

1037
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:42,930
you know, I've been having

1038
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,331
the weirdest dreams lately.

1039
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:48,099
No, I'm not going to.

1040
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,317
Just tell you.

1041
00:57:49,317 --> 00:57:51,068
It's embarrassing.

1042
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:53,069
You'll make fun of me.

1043
00:57:54,636 --> 00:57:57,304
Oh, you'll have to pretend

1044
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:59,288
like you don't know either.

1045
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,207
Besides the nightmare.

1046
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:05,758
It's not like I really dream
about anyone else.

1047
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:07,209
Besides, you

1048
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,827
don't have to tease me so much.

1049
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:11,378
You know that

1050
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:14,262
you're bully

1051
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,314
fine.

1052
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:18,281
I just want to follow you.

1053
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:21,099
Then how about that?

1054
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,502
Oh. You want it that badly?

1055
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:31,354
Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:32,888
OK. OK, sorry.

1057
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:33,789
Sorry.

1058
00:58:33,939 --> 00:58:36,340
I don't tease you like that again.

1059
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:38,708
Fine.

1060
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:39,725
Come here.

1061
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:46,378
I'll hold

1062
00:58:46,378 --> 00:59:20,029
your can you.

1063
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:20,829
Know, I worry.

1064
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:23,981
About how you treat yourself till since

1065
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:27,032
I'm not the only hard worker here.

1066
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:28,116
Take it easy.

1067
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:30,867
Once in a while. OK,

1068
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,419
maybe we should go on a date
to the Spring Festival together.

1069
00:59:35,403 --> 00:59:37,737
The flowers are all blooming
right now and.

1070
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:38,354
To. Be great.

1071
00:59:38,354 --> 00:59:40,922
Take pictures together, right?

1072
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:41,940
Yeah.

1073
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:44,858
I want to see the flowers.

1074
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:45,691
So feel

1075
00:59:49,593 --> 00:59:52,111
you're really beautiful, too.

1076
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:54,713
More beautiful than any of them.

1077
00:59:54,713 --> 00:59:56,680
Was that you? Cheesy.

1078
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,747
Sorry.

1079
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:02,050
But, you know, I mean that, right?

1080
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,684
You make me so happy

1081
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,786
and you smell good.

1082
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:11,738
And you look so stunning in the sunlight.

1083
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:15,356
OK, ok.

1084
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:19,025
I think that's enough cuddling, though.

1085
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:20,742
I think it's about time
we make dinner soon.

1086
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,276
Right

1087
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:24,511
now, it's ok.

1088
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:27,095
You can rest a little while longer.

1089
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:29,847
I can take care of dinner tonight.

1090
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,065
No, I don't need any help.

1091
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:35,466
Please just rest if you need it.

1092
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:36,900
OK, babe,

1093
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,819
you can help out a little later
with dessert

1094
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:40,836
if you want

1095
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,655
now, close your eyes.

1096
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:49,540
That's it.

1097
01:00:49,757 --> 01:00:51,107
Good.

1098
01:00:51,341 --> 01:00:52,842
Good boy.

1099
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:55,560
Good girl.

1100
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:03,447
You've always liked forehead
kisses, right?

1101
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:07,082
Yeah, I know you do.

1102
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,717
And I'll wake you up soon.

1103
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,352
Sleep well, baby.

1104
01:01:14,169 --> 01:01:15,303
I love you.

1105
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:19,388
Goodnight.

1106
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:28,293
OK, that was.

1107
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,111
Yeah, that was one.

1108
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:32,728
My friend

1109
01:01:33,095 --> 01:01:34,963
wrote for me.

1110
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:38,831
Because I had no idea what to do.

1111
01:01:38,915 --> 01:01:43,617
And she was like, you know,
I think something a little.

1112
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:48,119
A little cheesy romantic would fit.

1113
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,871
And then I was like, sure, why not?

1114
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,072
So, hey, I tried.

1115
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:55,256
I didn't

1116
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:59,375
I just like my first, like, you know, time
reading through the entire thing

1117
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:02,910
since he gave it to me.

1118
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,877
He's really cute.

1119
01:02:03,877 --> 01:02:05,228
That's really cute, though.

1120
01:02:05,228 --> 01:02:06,762
My two are

1121
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:08,980
not too weird.

1122
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:16,417
Sorry.

1123
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:17,017
That's a stretch.

1124
01:02:17,017 --> 01:02:17,317
Really.

1125
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,101
Second

1126
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:24,087
I think you should those right.

1127
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:27,522
It felt so cheesy.

1128
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:29,307
It felt so cheesy, dude.

1129
01:02:29,307 --> 01:02:33,876
Like, Oh my God, there's so much
mozzarella and and chowder everywhere.

1130
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:36,027
When I was reading through it

1131
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:40,262
I thought

1132
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,347
it was cute though.

1133
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,549
Know as long as you guys liked it
then that's all that matters.

1134
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:48,033
Sorry.

1135
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,001
Cheesy is.

1136
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,418
Good, Ivan.

1137
01:02:52,418 --> 01:02:54,669
Yeah,
everyone likes some cheese, but, man,

1138
01:02:55,536 --> 01:02:56,970
it's like

1139
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:58,321
there's.

1140
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,839
You can have
you can have too much cheese, right?

1141
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:04,474
You can have a little
too much cheese sometimes. So

1142
01:03:08,093 --> 01:03:08,459
it's on.

1143
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,894
So take a shot every time. She says,
don't look at me tonight.

1144
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:11,794
Oh, my God.

1145
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:13,862
You're going to get very inebriated on

1146
01:03:16,113 --> 01:03:19,598
very, very inebriated.

1147
01:03:20,315 --> 01:03:20,582
Indeed.

1148
01:03:20,582 --> 01:03:24,184
Thank you for the $13 chateau.

1149
01:03:24,184 --> 01:03:26,318
You're Sookie.
I want to give you a big hug. Then do it.

1150
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:27,369
How are you?

1151
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:30,087
Come here and give me a hug. Then
Oh, yeah.

1152
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:30,837
I remember last.

1153
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:34,739
Time there a song tell me to do a dipen.

1154
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:38,608
And then it came out really weak. Like

1155
01:03:39,392 --> 01:03:40,242
it sounded really.

1156
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:41,976
Ah, baby,

1157
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,378
and people made fun of me for it
because it was so weak.

1158
01:03:46,378 --> 01:03:48,396
But it's. I can't.

1159
01:03:48,396 --> 01:03:50,847
If I do it too loud, then.

1160
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,282
It's going to hurt your ears. Right?

1161
01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:55,750
So I'm not going to do that.

1162
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:56,800
That's. I didn't want to do that.

1163
01:04:00,786 --> 01:04:03,420
Yeah, it was like it was last time

1164
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:08,106
it's going to break anybody's
ears too early.

1165
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,106
Right?

1166
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:13,108
Something for the kids.

1167
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:13,859
Oh, no.

1168
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,527
Good morning to you
and good night to myself.

1169
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:17,877
Good night.

1170
01:04:17,877 --> 01:04:21,313
Did I hear any good one

1171
01:04:21,613 --> 01:04:22,713
other? Thank you for the zone.

1172
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:24,364
I, too, was so comfy.

1173
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,831
I'm almost falling asleep.

1174
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:29,200
How many of you guys are on your phone
right now?

1175
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:31,868
I want to know again

1176
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,553
how many people are listening
to me on their phone or on the PC?

1177
01:04:36,687 --> 01:04:37,287
Yeah,

1178
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:49,110
oh, that's a lot of people
listening on the phone.

1179
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:51,311
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

1180
01:04:59,165 --> 01:05:00,749
Yeah, a lot of phone users.

1181
01:05:00,749 --> 01:05:01,483
I mean, it makes sense.

1182
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:04,117
Some people are still in bed, right?

1183
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,652
A lot of people. Just

1184
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:10,570
rolled into bed
and they might pass out. So

1185
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:17,140
Sunset iPad. Wow.

1186
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,508
I haven't used an iPad in such a long
time.

1187
01:05:20,075 --> 01:05:21,343
It's been like years.

1188
01:05:21,343 --> 01:05:23,577
I think since I've gone to touch one

1189
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:30,747
but I hope you guys enjoyed that

1190
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:32,081
little prompt

1191
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:36,250
if you have any.

1192
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,084
What's it

1193
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,802
if you have any small requests,

1194
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:43,587
you can let me know either through

1195
01:05:43,737 --> 01:05:46,322
chat or through donations or whatever.

1196
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:50,524
I can try and do them
if you want for the rest of the stream,

1197
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:55,893
like something that's doable.

1198
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:57,511
Nothing like too much, of course,

1199
01:05:57,511 --> 01:06:01,479
but I'll read through it
and if I can do it, I'll try and do it.

1200
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:04,531
Like say a phrase like I'm our last time.

1201
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:07,632
So and try to give me a say
that skirmish line or whatever.

1202
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:10,500
And I was just

1203
01:06:10,984 --> 01:06:11,651
I free balled.

1204
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:14,953
It ends is pretty, you know,

1205
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,438
I'd say it was close, right?

1206
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:22,923
Kind of miaow is it?

1207
01:06:23,157 --> 01:06:25,091
Everyone wants him yell.

1208
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:27,342
I like miaow like miaowing.

1209
01:06:27,342 --> 01:06:29,910
I guess when I hear cats for

1210
01:06:33,462 --> 01:06:34,329
yeah.

1211
01:06:34,713 --> 01:06:37,431
Yeah, yeah.

1212
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:40,299
I yeah.

1213
01:06:40,299 --> 01:06:41,232
Well,

1214
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:43,567
you well.

1215
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,318
I don't know how to miaow dude.

1216
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:48,253
I don't think I know. I don't know.

1217
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:50,937
It's it's not
it doesn't come as easy as like,

1218
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,890
like, like dog does.

1219
01:06:56,757 --> 01:06:58,958
It's hard to do both.

1220
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:02,376
It's not like I'm pick and choose
voice actor.

1221
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:08,246
She can do a lot uh.

1222
01:07:08,796 --> 01:07:09,747
A wolf

1223
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:11,614
d wolves.

1224
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:12,748
Well, well,

1225
01:07:13,382 --> 01:07:14,582
well, well.

1226
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:17,517
Oh, hold on.

1227
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:18,851
Give me a second.

1228
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:20,702
I think I

1229
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:23,320
yeah, give me a quick second.

1230
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,721
Guilties hold on.

1231
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:33,842
Sorry.

1232
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,726
I thought I heard somebody at my door.

1233
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:37,894
I don't think anyone was there.

1234
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:43,230
On your on your on your

1235
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:44,464

Guys like.

1237
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:46,949
The O'Neals so much.

1238
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,917
You know who I blame?

1239
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,051
I blame.

1240
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:55,319
I blame the boys

1241
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:58,571
for for influencing that

1242
01:08:00,389 --> 01:08:00,906
yeah.

1243
01:08:00,906 --> 01:08:01,773
All of are.

1244

All them are.

1245
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:05,908
Quite an influence in

1246
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,810
you know, that's ok.

1247
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:10,827
It's totally fine.

1248
01:08:10,827 --> 01:08:12,278
It's adorable.

1249
01:08:14,346 --> 01:08:16,480
Oh. Katherine,

1250
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,382
your friend is going to have a birthday
and a wedding very soon.

1251
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:22,083
Can you give them a happy birthday
and happy wedding blessing?

1252
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:24,401
I can say. I can just say, hey,

1253
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,468
happy birthday.

1254
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:29,637
And to help
you enjoy your wedding to your friend.

01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:36,807
Thank you for the Tano
attending marks here.

1258
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:39,792
Three months as being a guilty, holding
you and smiling you my imagination.

1259
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,310
No, thank you, darling.

1260
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,977
Thank you for being around for so long.

1261
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:44,261
I know

1262
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:48,479
some of you people of

1263
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,697
your voice and words
and your heartbeat helps me a lot

1264
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:54,899
can you call me your little puppy, please?

1265
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:57,601
I thought I was the puppy here

1266
01:08:58,618 --> 01:08:59,201
which 1 a.m.

1267
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,853
I, owner or puppy?

1268
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,839
You have an exam in two weeks
and in a week?

1269
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:09,423
In two days.
Can you bully you into studying?

1270
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:12,658
You want me to bully you into studying?

1271
01:09:12,908 --> 01:09:14,042
How do I do that?

1272
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:15,343
I don't look like.

1273
01:09:15,343 --> 01:09:18,244
I listen to myself trying to be, like,
you know, assertive.

1274
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:20,562
And I could not take it seriously.

1275
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:23,247
Like, last time,
it made me so embarrassed guys.

1276
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:23,980
Like,

1277
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:28,800
I heard it, and I was like,
no, that does not feel right.

1278
01:09:29,283 --> 01:09:30,033
I can't.

1279
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,401
I can't be like, oh, go.

1280
01:09:33,852 --> 01:09:38,037
Go study right now
or go do your go to your work.

1281
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:42,840
Be word, you know,

1282
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,924
or or

1283
01:09:45,091 --> 01:09:47,976
go a fucking

1284
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,428
be responsible.

1285
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:53,378
You a whore.

1286
01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:57,247
I don't like that
that Zaza doesn't come after that song.

1287
01:09:59,131 --> 01:10:00,215
And doesn't come out.

1288
01:10:00,215 --> 01:10:03,333
It's on to all

1289
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,601
employees.

1290
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:07,119
I don't know.

1291
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,236
I feel like maybe it's not meant for me.

1292
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:14,106
I try and.

1293
01:10:14,106 --> 01:10:17,107
I try and I try. Trust me, I do.

1294
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:18,458
I really do.

1295
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:25,228
But it always like, you know, comes back
up and just makes me feel like.

1296
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:28,263
Well,
it doesn't feel it doesn't feel right.

1297
01:10:29,913 --> 01:10:31,781
Doesn't feel natural.

1298
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:36,817
It's not even about tough.

1299
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,651
It's like involving a top or it's on.

1300
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,619
It's just like, you know. That being mean.

1301
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,987
Or like degrading.

1302
01:10:43,987 --> 01:10:46,088
I feel like being mean
and degrading is not my forte.

1303
01:10:48,639 --> 01:10:50,791
And even though
I tried it before, it's like

1304
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:55,243
doing it on the spot, it's kind of like.

1305
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,528
Well, I don't want to be mean to you when.

1306
01:10:58,561 --> 01:11:00,312
You just, you know,

1307
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:02,980
I mean, you did give me permission
to be means you.

1308
01:11:03,063 --> 01:11:05,098
So I guess that's different

1309
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,151
well,

1310
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:16,203
so are you going to hear me
stretching a lot?

1311
01:11:16,203 --> 01:11:19,138
Because again,
I woke up not too long ago, so.

1312
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:21,523
I need to.

1313
01:11:22,857 --> 01:11:24,908
Crack my bones and my back

1314
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:38,231
yeah.

1315
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:39,965
Cracks a little bit.

1316
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:43,767
I I feel like when you stretch, you should
hear your bones crack like a little.

1317
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,102
It's because you're, like, getting rid
of all that pent up gas or whatever.

1318
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:51,938
It's in between your bones.

1319
01:11:56,106 --> 01:12:01,209
OK, oh, we were one K away from

1320
01:12:02,226 --> 01:12:03,027
from 400 on.

1321
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,078
So they're really.

1322
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:06,178
Really

1323
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:09,130
hold on.

1324
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:10,030
I didn't know a lot.

1325
01:12:11,347 --> 01:12:11,914
Oh, my God.

1326
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:12,815
We are

1327
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,118
oh, my goodness.

1328
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:20,969
Oh, my goodness.

1329
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:24,037
Did you write a really close

1330
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:28,089
thank you, guys.

1331
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,008
That's really.

1332
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:34,109
Two and one day

1333
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:35,726
dots.

1334
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,027
You milestones and ones a.

1335
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:40,562
Pug. Pug

1336
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:45,698
oh, thank you for another dimension.

1337
01:12:45,698 --> 01:12:49,233
Can you whisper in my ear
like last time? Hmm.

1338
01:12:54,419 --> 01:12:56,587
I think I can when I get

1339
01:12:57,937 --> 01:13:01,589
the last, like, I might read
through the script that we did last time.

1340
01:13:01,589 --> 01:13:02,306
Again,

1341
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:05,741
for Fonzie's

1342
01:13:05,908 --> 01:13:08,226
because that one was really good.

1343
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:09,843
I'm proud of that.

1344
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:12,311
I think it'd be really nice
to go through that again.

1345
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:12,912
Yeah,

1346
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:18,598
so it's a very it's
a very sweet little one.

1347
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:22,049
Little message

1348
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:26,518
for for anybody,
whether it's your first time here

1349
01:13:26,518 --> 01:13:28,653
or like you're hearing again,
I feel like it's

1350
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,771
it gets a

1351
01:13:33,755 --> 01:13:36,940
comforting
idea or like a comforting message thrill.

1352
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,008
And that's all I want to do.

1353
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,194
So on.

1354
01:13:45,478 --> 01:13:47,495
Yeah, give me a second. I'll do that.

1355
01:13:47,495 --> 01:13:48,880
I'll probably do that.

1356
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:51,998
I just need to clear my throat real fast.

1357
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:54,632
All right, hold on.

1358
01:14:04,988 --> 01:14:08,523
OK, I don't know if you guys can hear
that.

1359
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,107
I think my

1360
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:13,208
there's like, something going on outside.

1361
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:13,442
I was.

1362
01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:18,778
I'd ok

1363
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,364
am I eating

1364
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:25,598
and my eating?

1365
01:14:25,598 --> 01:14:27,666
No, I'm not eating.

1366
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,449
I mean.

1367
01:14:28,483 --> 01:14:30,951
I ate before this, you know,
if that's what you mean.

1368
01:14:30,951 --> 01:14:33,735
I'm not eating right now.

1369
01:14:34,752 --> 01:14:35,553
You know?

1370
01:14:35,553 --> 01:14:37,387
Hold on, hold on. Give me a second.

1371
01:14:37,387 --> 01:14:40,022
I, I could, I could

1372
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:52,595
I could do this

1373
01:15:17,307 --> 01:15:18,041
yeah.

1374
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:18,841
Some people like.

1375
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:20,459
The crunch right

1376
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:33,582
yeah.

1377
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:35,316
It's more pretzels.

1378
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:38,918
People like.

1379
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,235
That's a

1380
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:45,188
when I crunch on the
hard pretzels from my bag.

1381
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:49,090
I swore aloud.

1382
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:49,473
What do you mean?

1383
01:15:49,473 --> 01:15:51,858
I swallow loud? Well,
you can hear that to.

1384
01:15:52,408 --> 01:15:54,042
Oh, my God, you can hear me swallow like.

1385
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:55,359
Oh, God, dude.

1386
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:55,976
Holy shit.

1387
01:15:55,976 --> 01:16:09,967
I didn't know that OK?

1388
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,685
Nah. It's water.

1389
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:21,389
I was just drinking some water. OK?

1390
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:28,326
But I think I'm good to a read there.

1391
01:16:28,443 --> 01:16:30,577
Another part, another prompt.

1392
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,828
So give me a second

1393
01:16:40,365 --> 01:16:43,000
a swallowing is somewhere. No.

1394
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:44,584
All right.

1395
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,971
We did this one last time,
but I wanted to do it again.

1396
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:53,972
OK, so

1397
01:16:56,707 --> 01:16:59,975
oh, you're still in bed, darling.

1398
01:17:02,259 --> 01:17:04,327
It's been 2 hours,
and you've been scrolling

1399
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:07,929
through twitter and ticktock all morning.

1400
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:10,330
Are you enjoying yourself?

1401
01:17:13,332 --> 01:17:14,015
You had a hard day.

1402
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:15,633
Yessiree, babe.

1403
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:20,919
Oh, I know you work so hard all the time,

1404
01:17:21,786 --> 01:17:24,637
but if you keep working yourself
like this, you're going to burn out

1405
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:29,073
you've had a lot on your plate lately,

1406
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:32,191
and we haven't gone to go out
much to get either.

1407
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:36,727
This everything OK?

1408
01:17:38,678 --> 01:17:38,944
I know

1409
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:41,462
work is important,
but you should remember that

1410
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:44,247
you're the most important

1411
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,736
don't try and overdo it, please.

1412
01:17:55,986 --> 01:17:57,370
I know you can be a little too nice

1413
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:59,471
sometimes and take on too much

1414
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:05,141
oh, I just.

1415
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:09,993
I want you to value yourself more, babe.

1416
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:14,379
OK, you know, you.

1417
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:16,180
Mean the world to me.

1418
01:18:18,147 --> 01:18:21,883
Have you been eating enough lately to

1419
01:18:21,966 --> 01:18:22,983
sorry?

1420
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,301
I just worry about you a lot.

1421
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:26,068
You know,

1422
01:18:28,152 --> 01:18:28,986
well,

1423
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:32,821
it's nice to spend the morning
like this to ourselves.

1424
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:37,624
Yes, come here.

1425
01:18:37,924 --> 01:18:41,409
Let me take care of you today, OK?

1426
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:42,810
I'll make you breakfast after this

1427
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:48,479
till now.

1428
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:51,581
What does my love once eat today, huh?

1429
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:55,800
Omelettes, bacon,

1430
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,250
hash browns.

1431
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,752
Hash browns
actually sound really good right now.

1432
01:19:01,753 --> 01:19:04,471
Maybe I can make an egg souffle.

1433
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:06,572
I can make some pancakes

1434
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:08,789
and try a new recipe.

1435
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:11,524
Sorry.

1436
01:19:11,858 --> 01:19:14,609
I'm just this hungry too. I guess

1437
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,410
maybe if you're feeling better,
we can make it together.

1438
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,879
If you want to make it together,

1439
01:19:22,413 --> 01:19:24,147
you're not feeling it.

1440
01:19:26,798 --> 01:19:28,983
Oh, honey,

1441
01:19:29,283 --> 01:19:31,984
you have to take care of yourself
tomorrow, OK?

1442
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:37,771
You know,
you can lean on me more too, right?

1443
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:40,955
You love me, right?

1444
01:19:42,223 --> 01:19:43,707
I love you, too.

1445
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:47,525
It's OK to ask for help.

1446
01:19:47,942 --> 01:19:53,695
It's OK to feel a little vulnerable
to shh.

1447
01:19:54,846 --> 01:19:56,130
That's it.

1448
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,447
Let it out.

1449
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:00,215
Good bye.

1450
01:20:03,817 --> 01:20:05,885
Good girl.

1451
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,685
Good bye.

1452
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:11,921
You're amazing.

1453
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,492
You're amazing

1454
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:23,227
and special.

1455
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:27,212
In one of a kind.

1456
01:20:30,297 --> 01:20:30,597
Nights.

1457
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:31,781
I'll never want to see you hurt

1458
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:35,916
you too.

1459
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,017
A lot every day.

1460
01:20:37,017 --> 01:20:40,502
And it's okay to take some time
for yourself once in a while.

1461
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:46,288
It's OK to be a little greedy
and need some more affection.

1462
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,006
All right.

1463
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:52,741
Just ask me and I'll be there for you.

1464
01:20:55,143 --> 01:20:57,777
I'll always be there for you.

1465
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:05,681
You've been doing so well.

1466
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:09,383
You don't need to try so hard
all the time.

1467
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:13,902
You're really inspiring.

1468
01:21:14,052 --> 01:21:17,320
Not only to me,
but to so many other people.

1469
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,138
You might not even realise

1470
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:21,823
I'm not lying either.

1471
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:23,140
I promise.

1472
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:27,876
So what would you like me to do for you

1473
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:29,376
today, darling?

1474
01:21:32,378 --> 01:21:35,313
I can clean up while you sleep. Why?

1475
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:38,197
I can make all the meals for today.

1476
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:40,899
Maybe I can do all your chores till

1477
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:44,517
you just want my company

1478
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:50,487
you know you have all the time, right?

1479
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:52,655
Oh, on

1480
01:21:58,691 --> 01:21:59,158
sorry.

1481
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:02,259
I thought I heard something outside me
that's on my room.

1482
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:11,097
You just saw my company.

1483
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:15,383
You know,
you'll always have it all the time, right?

1484
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:16,350
Silly.

1485
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:19,751
As if I'm going to go anywhere

1486
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:25,738
OK? I can do that for you.

1487
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:28,956
Anything for you.

1488
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:29,740
My hard.

1489
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:34,059
Little worker. Hmm.

1490
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,728
Deep breaths, ok?

1491
01:22:40,445 --> 01:22:42,663
Breathe slowly.

1492
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,047
That's

1493
01:22:44,997 --> 01:22:45,898
good.

1494
01:22:47,015 --> 01:22:48,883
That's my boy.

1495
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:51,868
That's my girl.

1496
01:22:53,018 --> 01:22:56,020
Focus on my voice now.

1497
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,188
I'm proud of you, baby.

1498
01:23:00,038 --> 01:23:02,490
I'm so proud of you.

1499
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:09,760
Even if things feel like

1500
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,611
they don't seem like they're going,
they're a right way.

1501
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:15,363
You'll get better.

1502
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:19,948
You'll get what you want.

1503
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:23,066
You know I'll be there.

1504
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:25,768
I'll be there beside you for it.

1505
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:26,618
Just.

1506
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,136
It's been stressful, right?

1507
01:23:31,587 --> 01:23:33,138
And you've been doing your best

1508
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:36,206
right shh.

1509
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,208
Shh. It's ok.

1510
01:23:40,242 --> 01:23:43,060
Everything will be OK, babe.

1511
01:23:45,578 --> 01:23:48,929
Everything will be OK.

1512
01:23:51,898 --> 01:23:52,498
Just first, your

1513
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:55,383
head down a little while longer.

1514
01:23:56,316 --> 01:23:58,751
And listen to my voice

1515
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:04,420
forget about everything else

1516
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,289
and listen to me. OK?

1517
01:24:08,289 --> 01:24:11,607
Good, good.

1518
01:24:11,607 --> 01:24:13,242
That's right.

1519
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,276
Good girl.

1520
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:17,610
Good boy.

1521
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:23,247
I'm here now

1522
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,898
and I'll always be here

1523
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:29,099
just call my name

1524
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:34,786
I love you. Rest

1525
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:38,187
that pretty face a little bit longer.

1526
01:24:38,888 --> 01:24:39,972
Darling,

1527
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:49,593
darling, darling, OK.

1528
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:54,579
Darling,

1529
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,997
I love that word.

1530
01:24:57,997 --> 01:24:58,598
It's really.

1531
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:02,166
It's really a cute little.

1532
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,550
I don't know.

1533
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,518
You call it like

1534
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,602
term of endearment.

1535
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,369
Yeah,

1536
01:25:14,172 --> 01:25:16,740
I'm glad you guys enjoyed that.

1537
01:25:18,357 --> 01:25:22,209
Oh, hello.

1538
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,160
Thank you for all the scripture reading.

1539
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,462
Can I also ask you to hum coffee?

1540
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:29,546
You'll meet hum coffee for you.

1541
01:25:31,447 --> 01:25:32,981
Yeah, I can do that.

1542
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:33,632
Sure.

1543
01:25:35,049 --> 01:25:36,783
I I can hum coffee.

1544
01:25:36,783 --> 01:25:38,467
Just give me a second.

1545
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,251
All right?

1546
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:47,188
All right.

1547
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:48,122
It's a drink.

1548
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:49,856
A little bit more water.

1549
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:53,758
Because I'm running out of water.

1550
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:58,628
Yeah, running long water.

1551
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:06,448
Got no more wah hmm.

1552
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:19,988
It feels weird to not even sing it

1553
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:24,457
so. Stay away for too long.

1554
01:26:24,907 --> 01:26:27,158
Tom, go to bed.

1555
01:26:28,092 --> 01:26:30,210
I'll make a cup of coffee.

1556
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:32,911
For you, and.

1557
01:26:33,462 --> 01:26:35,313
Yeah, we'll do that.

1558
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:36,280
Hold on.

1559
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:50,553
Tom. Stay awake for too long.

1560
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:53,788
Tom called up and said,

1561
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:59,625
I'll make a cup of coffee for you,
and I'll get you up.

1562
01:26:59,641 --> 01:27:03,627
And go and out of bed and I.

1563
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,778
Promise that. One day.

1564
01:27:06,912 --> 01:27:10,330
I'll feel fine.

1565
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,649
And I promise that one day

1566
01:27:14,682 --> 01:27:17,017
I'll feel all right.

1567
01:27:19,418 --> 01:27:20,819
And I'll make a cup.

1568
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:23,270
Of coffee with the right amount of sugar.

1569
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:24,754
I like

1570
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:29,556
and I'll make a cup of coffee over there.

1571
01:27:29,556 --> 01:27:30,874
I don't know no sugar.

1572
01:27:30,874 --> 01:27:33,992
How you like can

1573
01:27:34,442 --> 01:27:38,061
how you like.

1574
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:40,862
So know how.

1575
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:43,080
Long I'll stay for?

1576
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:45,598
It's OK.

1577
01:27:45,598 --> 01:27:47,749
Knock on your door.

1578
01:27:47,749 --> 01:27:49,800
Well, to come down.

1579
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,934
And get me.

1580
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:52,418
Oh, I.

1581
01:27:52,418 --> 01:27:57,637
Like it when you hold me tight

1582
01:27:58,437 --> 01:28:01,472
You make me feel nice

1583
01:28:02,406 --> 01:28:05,191
The green in your eyes.

1584
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:10,593
Makes me feel where I'm in sign

1585
01:28:11,677 --> 01:28:15,579
And I'll make a cup of coffee
with the right amount of sugar

1586
01:28:15,579 --> 01:28:18,581
How you like get

1587
01:28:19,448 --> 01:28:20,432
and I'll make.

1588
01:28:20,432 --> 01:28:23,817
A cup of coffee with the right
I'm gonna shake your hand

1589
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:26,401
till I get

1590
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:30,920
how you like

1591
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,708
my. Baby.

1592
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,191
Yeah,

1593
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:43,777
it felt more proper to sing it rather.

1594
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:44,911
Than hum it.

1595
01:28:54,215 --> 01:28:56,166
Things on all so requested close to all.

1596
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:58,001
I can probably do that

1597
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:03,186
and it's a popular one.

1598
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:06,071
You guys like a lot to someone
I like a lot. Tell

1599
01:29:12,725 --> 01:29:14,292

1600
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:17,944
Birds suddenly appear

1601
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:23,030
every time you ride in

1602
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:26,648
I love you a lot.

1603
01:29:28,032 --> 01:29:28,499
Yeah.

1604
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:30,567
Let me find it real quick.

1605
01:29:31,501 --> 01:29:33,902
Close to you

1606
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,420
lyrics

1607
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,775
Studio Ghibli songs.

1608
01:29:46,775 --> 01:29:49,176
I think the only

1609
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:53,912
Studio Ghibli song I know is

1610
01:29:53,912 --> 01:29:55,029
the one from Spirit Away Way.

1611
01:29:55,029 --> 01:29:57,097
That's like how to go again

1612
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:00,882
a month.

1613
01:30:00,882 --> 01:30:01,349

01:31:02,196 --> 01:31:03,513
What was the name?

1628
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,181
One summer day.

1629
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:08,749
Oh, it's one summer day.

1630
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:10,317
Oh, all right.

1631
01:31:10,317 --> 01:31:11,350
Thank you.

1632
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:15,686
Oh. Oh.

1633
01:31:19,221 --> 01:31:19,571
Well.

1634
01:31:25,324 --> 01:31:27,158
Hold on, Anita.

1635
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:29,193
And you get another drink really fast.

1636
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:31,110
All right.

1637
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,711
Here.

1638
01:31:47,652 --> 01:31:50,520
Oh. I felt really good.

1639
01:31:51,904 --> 01:31:53,405
It's apple juice.

1640
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:57,307
Yeah,
I just opened the thing of apple juice,

1641
01:31:57,307 --> 01:31:58,141
that's all.

1642
01:32:04,861 --> 01:32:05,761
Okay,

1643
01:32:09,246 --> 01:32:11,614
now I need to consider before I forget,

1644
01:32:12,815 --> 01:32:16,300
and then we can do other stuff.

1645
01:32:19,018 --> 01:32:20,802
Mm hmm.

1646
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:23,837
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1647
01:32:23,953 --> 01:32:27,539
And hmm, hmm, hmm,

1648
01:32:28,773 --> 01:32:33,141
hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm hmm.

1649
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:35,843
Hmm hmm hmm.

1650
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:40,979
Hmm. Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm

1651
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:43,897

1652
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,981
hmm hmm hmm hmm

1653
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:49,866
hmm hmm hmm

1654
01:32:49,866 --> 01:32:52,384

1655
01:32:52,384 --> 01:32:53,718
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

1657
01:33:01,322 --> 01:33:02,106
Okay.

1658
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:04,290
Okeydokey.

1659
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,628
Uh, shut the by to all means
all of you in Chinese.

1660
01:33:13,628 --> 01:33:16,480
And also, it's the week after
which I have a few chances.

1661
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:16,897
What a shame.

1662
01:33:16,897 --> 01:33:19,531
I study hard because of you,
especially learning English.

1663
01:33:20,498 --> 01:33:22,683
You always bring me warmth,
and I love you forever.

1664
01:33:24,567 --> 01:33:26,885
To the good luck of school, ok?

1665
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,187
And I believe in you. You got this.

1666
01:33:30,603 --> 01:33:32,888
Don't work too hard, though.

1667
01:33:34,055 --> 01:33:35,022
Are we doing song requests?

1668
01:33:35,022 --> 01:33:36,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1669
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,341
We're not doing song requests.

1670
01:33:39,508 --> 01:33:42,393
I was just doing a couple for fun,
that's all.

1671
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:45,394
This is not like a

1672
01:33:45,394 --> 01:33:48,029
it's not a karaoke stream.

1673
01:33:48,879 --> 01:33:49,363
Don't worry.

1674
01:33:49,363 --> 01:33:53,248
That can wait until next week, OK?

1675
01:33:53,848 --> 01:33:55,382
Oh, congrats on the educated.

1676
01:33:55,382 --> 01:33:57,550
You make a P.O.V.
like urging you to go to sleep.

1677
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,451
They'll help you a lot.

1678
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,469
I think I already did something like that
tonight.

1679
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:03,720
Did I not just do that?

1680
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,638
I feel like I just did that

1681
01:34:05,704 --> 01:34:06,271
with the.

1682
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:09,156
Other, you know, the other script
I just read

1683
01:34:12,808 --> 01:34:13,808
at least I think I did.

1684
01:34:13,808 --> 01:34:14,892
I don't know.

1685
01:34:16,827 --> 01:34:17,577
Puff, thank you for that.

1686
01:34:17,577 --> 01:34:19,928
So now,
because he'll buy your arse a Martian.

1687
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:21,245
Thank you for this sweet night.

1688
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:23,396
Can you give us more pep our some ear
massage.

1689
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,181
Or pat that.

1690
01:34:25,181 --> 01:34:27,632
On the ear like this

1691
01:34:28,899 --> 01:34:30,233
like I'm.

1692
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:34,152
Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

1693
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:41,539
Oh, yeah. Yes.

1694
01:34:41,539 --> 01:34:43,540
So I was talking about
you're blowing stuff again.

1695
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:44,707
I'm overwhelmed.

1696
01:34:44,707 --> 01:34:46,024
I don't know

1697
01:34:48,492 --> 01:34:50,377
somebody said not too hard,

1698
01:34:50,377 --> 01:34:53,361
but you can't do it too, like, low, too,
because he can't hear

1699
01:34:53,378 --> 01:34:53,912
right.

1700
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:57,097
Because

1701
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:59,581
I don't know what enough.

1702
01:34:59,581 --> 01:35:01,782
I tried.
I didn't get a chance to practise.

1703
01:35:01,782 --> 01:35:03,066
I did not get you instructors going.

1704
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:06,418
I didn't anticipate doing
another one of these so soon.

1705
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:14,222
I don't know.

1706
01:35:14,222 --> 01:35:16,023
Is that is that right?

1707
01:35:26,044 --> 01:35:29,646
Softer, softer.

1708
01:35:35,766 --> 01:35:37,884
I don't. Are

1709
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:43,870
so-and-so's it sound like a typhoon?

1710
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:46,805
No, never. No.

1711
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:47,705
No more.

1712
01:35:47,705 --> 01:35:50,823
No more. No,

1713
01:35:54,809 --> 01:35:56,710
you're mean typhoon

1714
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:00,328
or you mean not the.

1715
01:36:01,445 --> 01:36:02,579
I tried it.

1716
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:04,597
Maybe it's
just that maybe I'm just not cut out.

1717
01:36:04,597 --> 01:36:06,148
For it, you know,

1718
01:36:07,565 --> 01:36:09,816
maybe I'm just not cut out for the ear
blowing stuff.

1719
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:10,950
It's not my.

1720
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:13,385
It feels odd to when I try and do it

1721
01:36:27,242 --> 01:36:28,742
uh, would you mind

1722
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,810
see some daily pick up lines with

1723
01:36:32,111 --> 01:36:32,794
the fuck.

1724
01:36:32,794 --> 01:36:37,864
Boy what you want me
to lot of what you want me to say.

1725
01:36:37,864 --> 01:36:40,865
Pick up lines in a fuck boy voice no,

1726
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,584
no, I can't do that. Like

1727
01:36:46,201 --> 01:36:48,252
I unironically

1728
01:36:49,453 --> 01:36:52,621
or whatever cos though
I don't think I could do that.

1729
01:36:52,804 --> 01:36:55,573
Without like and yet somehow.

1730
01:36:55,689 --> 01:36:57,607
I could do that all boy stuff.

1731
01:36:57,607 --> 01:37:00,158
Crazy, right? Yeah. That's crazy.

1732
01:37:04,377 --> 01:37:05,111
Yeah.

1733
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:09,646
Basically asking to me to be like,
oh, hey, girl, ha ha ha.

1734
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:12,064
Fuck. Like, that kind of stuff.

1735
01:37:12,848 --> 01:37:15,933
And no,

1736
01:37:15,933 --> 01:37:19,701
or like, I could are like,
you want me to ask for your what?

1737
01:37:19,718 --> 01:37:21,569
You want me to ask for your number?

1738
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,087
They only say, like, oh,
what kind of music do you listen to?

1739
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,621
I like I like catchy.

1740
01:37:25,621 --> 01:37:27,755
Oh, what kind of
what kind of car do I ride?

1741
01:37:27,755 --> 01:37:28,839
I ride a Lexus.

1742
01:37:28,839 --> 01:37:31,140
I Well, what rank am I in? Legal legends.

1743
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,007
I'm Diamond.

1744
01:37:32,007 --> 01:37:34,025
Oh, I like I like Supreme.

I, I go to raves, right?

1746
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:37,560
I love Boba.

1747
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,478
I love Boba so much like that.

1748
01:37:40,478 --> 01:37:41,912
That's pretty much what you're asking.

1749
01:37:41,912 --> 01:37:44,547
Me to do right. Now.

1750
01:37:46,231 --> 01:37:48,966
I don't know the that's.

1751
01:37:48,966 --> 01:37:50,433
That's very much in. Yeah.

1752
01:37:52,268 --> 01:37:54,602
At least that's my experience

1753
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:55,869
of a lot of them.

1754
01:38:01,572 --> 01:38:04,257
Yeah, that's the ah, I don't know.

1755
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,908
From what
I've seen the Asian football experience.

1756
01:38:11,494 --> 01:38:12,461
Well like, I don't know.

1757
01:38:12,461 --> 01:38:16,063
Like most of them and most of them,
they always.

1758
01:38:16,063 --> 01:38:18,130
Right. A Lexus and have a perm. Yeah.

1759
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:19,748
And have a perm.

1760
01:38:20,282 --> 01:38:21,999
No, they have a perm. Right.

1761
01:38:21,999 --> 01:38:24,567
And then they say it's all is,
is, is a perm.

1762
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:25,567
No, it's all natural.

1763
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:27,785
It's all natural curls.

1764
01:38:30,453 --> 01:38:32,021
Like a liar.

1765
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:34,839
OK, I'm done.

1766
01:38:34,839 --> 01:38:35,106
I'm done.

1767
01:38:35,106 --> 01:38:35,973
I don't want a clown.

1768
01:38:35,973 --> 01:38:39,091
I'm not clowning on people anymore.

1769
01:38:40,508 --> 01:38:41,409
Kevin, you went, huh?

1770
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:43,176
Yeah, pretty much a Kevin Nealon.

1771
01:38:43,176 --> 01:38:51,364
You guys know OK?

1772
01:38:54,632 --> 01:38:57,900
So, um, I'm not too sure

1773
01:38:58,117 --> 01:39:00,518
what else I could do right now.

1774
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,088
Do you guys have any suggestions?

1775
01:39:10,857 --> 01:39:13,925
Any suggestions at all?

1776
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:21,362
You only say, Hey, girlie, who says that?

1777
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:22,963
Who says that?

1778
01:39:22,963 --> 01:39:25,147
Who or what? Who the fuck says.

1779
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:29,133
Oh, hey, girlie, stay still for me.

1780
01:39:29,616 --> 01:39:30,667
Like it does.

1781
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:34,152
Not come out really well, child. Ha

1782
01:39:42,122 --> 01:39:44,640
I had to put on my cologne.

1783
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:47,558
That's put on my headphones for this
because I'm.

1784
01:39:47,558 --> 01:39:49,176
I want to know till

1785
01:39:51,677 --> 01:39:53,411
is this is this the right video?

1786
01:39:53,411 --> 01:39:55,779
What are your

1787
01:40:00,298 --> 01:40:02,583
I'm not going to listen to that.

1788
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,017
That's all I need to hear.

1789
01:40:05,017 --> 01:40:06,001
I'm not listening to that.

1790
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:07,268
Sorry, guys.

1791
01:40:09,219 --> 01:40:10,687
As much as you would want me to.

1792
01:40:10,687 --> 01:40:13,655
I don't think I don't think I could last

1793
01:40:13,655 --> 01:40:16,840
another 2 seconds into that video.

1794
01:40:17,373 --> 01:40:18,507
That's not the. Video.

1795
01:40:18,507 --> 01:40:20,908
OK, well, I don't care. That's not the.

1796
01:40:21,209 --> 01:40:22,176
That's not the video.

1797
01:40:24,844 --> 01:40:26,911
What did
I what did you guys make me watch?

1798
01:40:27,162 --> 01:40:28,829
Oh, no.

1799
01:40:29,329 --> 01:40:33,748
Mm can I have a kiss

1800
01:40:35,683 --> 01:40:36,866
oh, sure.

1801
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:39,334
Thank you for the tone.
Oh, give me a second.

1802
01:40:39,334 --> 01:40:40,001
Let me do more.

1803
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:42,486
Believable sounds. Believable.

1804
01:40:42,486 --> 01:40:43,436
Believable sounds.

1805
01:40:43,436 --> 01:40:44,103
What are believable?

1806
01:40:44,103 --> 01:40:45,071
Sounds like

1807
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:52,324
pop, pop, pop, pop.

1808
01:40:53,558 --> 01:40:54,509
Like that.

1809
01:40:58,961 --> 01:40:59,828
Was mine.

1810
01:40:59,828 --> 01:41:02,513
It sounds like a it sounds like a, um.

1811
01:41:02,579 --> 01:41:04,630
What's it a fish?

1812
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:07,548
It sounds like I'm a fish.

1813
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:18,937
There's our kiss, though.

1814
01:41:18,937 --> 01:41:20,188
I almost forgot.

1815
01:41:21,339 --> 01:41:22,206
It sounds like a pop.

1816
01:41:22,206 --> 01:41:24,207
Yeah, pops.

1817
01:41:24,207 --> 01:41:24,540
Those are.

1818
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,858
Pop noises.

1819
01:41:40,482 --> 01:41:43,366
I don't know if that's what you wanted,
but I.

1820
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:44,984
I did that.

1821
01:41:47,819 --> 01:41:48,552
I hope that's.

1822
01:41:48,552 --> 01:41:50,020
I hope that's correct.

1823
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,204
Yes, it was. OK, cool. Cool.

1824
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:54,238
Thank you.

1825
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:01,325
You want me to pretend that I'm drunk,

1826
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:06,695
but I need to explain to my
partner that I'm not drunk.

1827
01:42:09,012 --> 01:42:11,013
I don't know how to pretend to be drunk

1828
01:42:11,847 --> 01:42:14,915
because. It's

1829
01:42:15,432 --> 01:42:15,966
I've never.

1830
01:42:15,966 --> 01:42:19,468
Had to, like, pretend to be drunk before
in my life because, like,

1831
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:21,552
why would you need to pretend to be drunk,
right?

1832
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:24,303
You just,
you know, when you're drunk, you're drunk.

1833
01:42:24,303 --> 01:42:26,321
You're just like. A little.

1834
01:42:26,321 --> 01:42:30,056
Tipsy and kind of, you know, out of it.

1835
01:42:30,056 --> 01:42:35,259
And just don't you have, like,
no inhibitions and all that?

1836
01:42:35,859 --> 01:42:36,576
Yeah.

1837
01:42:36,843 --> 01:42:39,628
You know, I found out I found out that

1838
01:42:41,012 --> 01:42:42,846
what kind of. Drunk was I? I'm not.

1839
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:46,415
I'm not like a sleepy I'm
not sleepy drunk, but I am a

1840
01:42:47,432 --> 01:42:48,816
I'm a

1841
01:42:50,316 --> 01:42:52,834
I'm like a happy, like, very happy.

1842
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:53,618
Vibes drunk.

1843
01:42:53,618 --> 01:42:56,820
And also just chill and happy.

1844
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,587
Yeah, I'd say I'm chill.

1845
01:42:58,587 --> 01:43:00,988
I'm happy and ah,

1846
01:43:02,339 --> 01:43:04,023
you would think I'd be horny.

1847
01:43:04,023 --> 01:43:05,157
You would think I'm a horny drunk.

1848
01:43:05,157 --> 01:43:06,658
But no, I'm not.

1849
01:43:06,841 --> 01:43:09,009
All I really am is just

1850
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,679
I just feel I just feel like I'm here
to have a good time.

1851
01:43:14,679 --> 01:43:15,963
And I want a hug.

1852
01:43:15,963 --> 01:43:17,230
I get affectionate.

1853
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:17,580
Oh, yeah.

1854
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:20,015
I get really affectionate. When I'm drunk.

1855
01:43:20,015 --> 01:43:21,732
I'm like, I want to hug.

1856
01:43:21,732 --> 01:43:23,800
I want to hug people
when I get drunk, like,

1857
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:27,302
and not even, like, get, you know, like,

1858
01:43:28,235 --> 01:43:30,303
that type of vibe.

1859
01:43:30,303 --> 01:43:34,172
Just I want to just hold somebody
or, like, be held by somebody.

1860
01:43:34,172 --> 01:43:36,306
Either way, you know, body contact

1861
01:43:41,309 --> 01:43:43,810
it's the help of the top of the comfort

1862
01:43:44,043 --> 01:43:46,828
even more, I think, just enhance it

1863
01:43:47,879 --> 01:43:50,196
a lot of people
asking for goodnight kisses right now.

1864
01:43:50,196 --> 01:43:52,114
Sure, I can do that.

1865
01:43:54,482 --> 01:43:56,500
You worked hard today, darling.

1866
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,517
Goodnight.

1867
01:44:05,921 --> 01:44:07,238
Goodnight.

1868
01:44:07,472 --> 01:44:08,856
Sleep well.

1869
01:44:15,242 --> 01:44:17,026
Good luck tomorrow.

1870
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:27,899
Come come that they're gone, buddy.

For those of you
that want to sleep, rest well, OK.

1879
01:44:53,728 --> 01:44:55,296
Don't stay up too long.

01:44:59,131 --> 01:44:59,398
Yeah.

1881
01:44:59,398 --> 01:45:01,565

I think that's pretty lewd.

1941
01:48:20,582 --> 01:48:22,633

01:48:26,518 --> 01:48:27,001

I forgot what it means.

1949
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,892
I have to ask
somebody. Can someone translate that?

1950
01:48:42,726 --> 01:48:45,461
Yes. It's
it just means let's sleep together.

1951
01:48:45,611 --> 01:48:46,961
That that's wholesome.

1952
01:48:46,961 --> 01:48:48,879
It's like,
hey, let's go to bed and sleep, right?

1953
01:48:48,879 --> 01:48:51,664
It just means that sleep together

Oh, no, oh.

01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:26,231

It's like saying, oh,

1979
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:19,257
You look very beautiful.
Are you something? I don't know.

2042
01:53:41,642 --> 01:53:42,492

The other vibe.

2050
01:53:54,882 --> 01:53:58,167
I guess it's like the
the cultural implication from I know I'm

2051
01:53:58,167 --> 01:54:04,920
not Korean, so my

2052
01:54:10,656 --> 01:54:10,857

01:54:48,209 --> 01:54:49,476
sometimes.

All I need. Hmm.

02:03:38,223 --> 02:03:40,541
Is that a name is on, then?

2236
02:03:40,925 --> 02:03:42,426
I don't know.

Hold on.

2241

Column

02:04:01,352 --> 02:04:02,736
Cogent.

2243
02:04:03,036 --> 02:04:05,670
Column C consider

2244
02:04:06,871 --> 02:04:10,039
call to call and see I.

2245
02:04:10,056 --> 02:04:10,773
Oh, my God.

2246
02:04:10,773 --> 02:04:12,641
I don't know. Polish dialect.

2247
02:04:12,641 --> 02:04:14,642
So I'm very unfamiliar with that.

2248
02:04:16,626 --> 02:04:20,528
Slow, but surely I'm getting more used
to a Swedish dialect, though, because of.

2249
02:04:20,528 --> 02:04:27,031
I like, there is like I know

2250
02:04:27,031 --> 02:04:31,600
there's like a phrase that he says
that's like, just lovely something.

2251
02:04:31,917 --> 02:04:34,568
Zavala It's something.

2252
02:04:35,452 --> 02:04:38,287
It's just more Swedish cursing. Yeah.

2253
02:04:41,021 --> 02:04:42,122
Don't tell him I said that.

2254
02:04:42,122 --> 02:04:44,306
Yeah, don't tell him I don't tell my said
anything bad.

2255
02:04:44,973 --> 02:04:47,641
He got mad. At me
when I said the word for pussy

2256
02:04:47,641 --> 02:04:49,326
in the Swedish

2257
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:55,229
understandably so,
because I think it's, it's like,

2258
02:04:55,229 --> 02:04:58,263
I think it's like,
you know, offence is like.

2259
02:04:58,263 --> 02:04:59,547
Why would you say that?

2260
02:04:59,547 --> 02:05:00,281
You know,

02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:05,200

02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:40,951
Oh, darling, I'm Vietnamese.

Like I want to learn more stuff
that's equivalent ah.

2275

02:05:59,377 --> 02:06:00,478
Like, how do you how.

2277
02:06:00,478 --> 02:06:06,247
Do you guys say like, hey,
one want to come over and do something?

2278
02:06:06,397 --> 02:06:09,432
But in actuality, like, you're,
you're like, you know,

2279
02:06:09,432 --> 02:06:12,851
it's like a code phrase for sex, right?

2280
02:06:13,318 --> 02:06:17,470
Like, of the whole, like a common mockery

2281
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:19,137
thing.

2282
02:06:20,921 --> 02:06:22,956
To know if anyone has that.

2283
02:06:26,407 --> 02:06:27,275
Oh, wait.

2284
02:06:27,275 --> 02:06:30,043

Jelly.

2288
02:06:37,196 --> 02:06:38,047
Really

2289
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:45,667
OK, that doesn't sound right. OK.

2290
02:06:54,722 --> 02:06:57,406
Lao low

2291
02:06:58,474 --> 02:06:59,057

2292
02:06:59,407 --> 02:07:01,408
Yeah. What is what does that mean?

2293
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:05,644
I should look,
I should look these things up.

2294
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:09,512
Lao Paul Alpo.

2295
02:07:09,512 --> 02:07:11,697
Lao Bo Alpo.

2296
02:07:14,548 --> 02:07:15,182
It means old.

2297
02:07:15,182 --> 02:07:16,149
Lady.

2298
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,700
It means wife.

2299
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:21,668
Oh, it means wife.

2300
02:07:21,668 --> 02:07:25,270
Ha, it has a lot of juicy meanings.

2301
02:07:25,387 --> 02:07:26,771
This is what it says.

2302
02:07:26,771 --> 02:07:28,388
Why? Oh, why would it have.

2303
02:07:28,388 --> 02:07:30,540
Juicy meanings, huh?

2304
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:32,724
Isn't it just mean wife. Most of all?
Why would it?

2305
02:07:32,907 --> 02:07:34,508
Why would I have juicy meanings?

2306
02:07:34,508 --> 02:07:35,309
What does that mean?

2307
02:07:35,309 --> 02:07:37,476
Juicy. Huh?

2308
02:07:39,161 --> 02:07:42,212
OK. It's flirty.

2309
02:07:42,579 --> 02:07:46,231
Oh, oh, it's flirty. OK,

2310
02:07:50,766 --> 02:07:52,267
that's really cool.

2311
02:07:52,867 --> 02:07:54,301
That's the way to describe it, I guess.

2312
02:07:54,301 --> 02:07:55,502
Juicy. Yeah,

2313
02:07:59,888 --> 02:08:00,971
ok. OK.

2314
02:08:00,971 --> 02:08:01,989
I see. Thank you.

2315
02:08:01,989 --> 02:08:04,840
I'm being educated
and being more and more educated

2316
02:08:05,407 --> 02:08:06,724
by the day.

2317
02:08:12,911 --> 02:08:15,062
If all they see is.

2318
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,463
Oh, ok. OK.

2319
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:19,681
All right, Barbie.

2320
02:08:20,164 --> 02:08:20,998
Got it.

2321
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:25,834
I feel like, ok.

2322
02:08:25,834 --> 02:08:28,569
I feel like I've embarrassed myself
enough.

2323
02:08:28,802 --> 02:08:31,954
Were far off
trying to say these and say all this.

2324
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:35,522
So I will simply

2325
02:08:35,522 --> 02:08:39,124
leave you guys off with a long, sloppy
kiss.

2326
02:08:39,357 --> 02:08:42,492
So, hey, prepare your ears
because it's about to get really,

2327
02:08:42,876 --> 02:08:44,376
really personal.

2328
02:08:45,844 --> 02:08:48,228
Mm hmm.

2329
02:08:50,013 --> 02:08:52,114
I think that was my mom in the background.

2330
02:08:52,114 --> 02:08:54,215
She probably just sneezed. OK.

2331
02:08:55,232 --> 02:09:02,819
And did you hear that?

2332
02:09:06,154 --> 02:09:07,888
Did you hear that?

2333
02:09:10,056 --> 02:09:12,274
Mom, get out of here!

2334
02:09:12,274 --> 02:09:13,408
God! Get out!

2335
02:09:13,408 --> 02:09:15,425
Mom, cut down.

2336
02:09:16,059 --> 02:09:17,460
There it goes again.

2337
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:18,577
There she goes again.

2338
02:09:18,577 --> 02:09:21,545
OK, ok, ok, ok, ok.

2339
02:09:21,762 --> 02:09:23,613
It's just me and you.
Just me and you. All right?

2340
02:09:42,889 --> 02:09:50,860
I just got.

2341
02:09:52,527 --> 02:09:53,411
To say bless you.

2342
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:55,812
Yeah, I guess. Bless you.

2343
02:09:55,812 --> 02:09:56,412

2441
02:16:25,474 --> 02:16:28,842
I recently felt particularly happy
because I met you, although the previous

2442
02:16:29,892 --> 02:16:31,260
also lived a very happy life.

2443
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:34,061
After knowing you feel more happy.

2444
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:36,846
I think I understand
what you were trying to say there. And

2445
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:39,681

02:16:53,187 --> 02:16:55,055
Too awkward. For you.

2452
02:16:55,055 --> 02:16:58,473
The whole lot is similar experience.

2453
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,491
I won't be doing this next week, though.

2454
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:04,059
Because it was just like one more time
to try and feel a little bit

2455
02:17:04,059 --> 02:17:05,260
more confident about it.

2456
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:08,795
And I feel like I succeeded in that

2457
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:12,297

2470
02:17:55,619 --> 02:17:57,636
oh everything anything extreme.

2471
02:17:58,170 --> 02:18:00,521
You guys you and your friends
have been under a lot of pressure recently

2472
02:18:00,521 --> 02:18:02,038
because of some work mistakes.

2473
02:18:02,038 --> 02:18:04,540
How do you relieve the work pressure?

2474
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:06,057
How do I relieve work pressure?

2475
02:18:06,057 --> 02:18:07,391
Masturbate

2476
02:18:08,942 --> 02:18:10,092
just kidding.

2477
02:18:10,293 --> 02:18:15,178
I usually like to play some video games
and I like to sing a lot.

2478
02:18:15,428 --> 02:18:18,747
So most of the time, whenever I'm
feeling anxious or stressed out,

2479
02:18:19,047 --> 02:18:22,482
I try to

2480
02:18:22,715 --> 02:18:23,349
what's it.

2481
02:18:23,349 --> 02:18:27,118
I try to sing a song or
like sing a few songs that I really enjoy

2482
02:18:27,301 --> 02:18:28,302
at the time.

2483
02:18:28,302 --> 02:18:32,170
And singing really helps take the,
you know, anxiety away

2484
02:18:32,487 --> 02:18:34,988
and I get to just vibe out with a,

2485
02:18:36,222 --> 02:18:39,057
you know, with a song
that I've been I'm comfortable with.

2486
02:18:39,841 --> 02:18:42,342
It lets out
a lot of tension from your like,

2487
02:18:42,842 --> 02:18:43,993
I'll know from your brain

2488
02:18:43,993 --> 02:18:46,661
when you're just like lose your thoughts
in the lyrics, in the melody,

2489
02:18:47,461 --> 02:18:48,845
singing or video games.

2490
02:18:48,845 --> 02:18:52,630
So I like playing golf
and fantasy league and you know,

Bellerin in Minecraft

2492
02:19:02,202 --> 02:19:02,469
maybe

2493
02:19:02,469 --> 02:19:04,653
you can learn to introduce yourself in
Chinese.

2494
02:19:05,854 --> 02:19:08,255

2504
02:19:33,818 --> 02:19:35,819

02:19:35,952 --> 02:19:41,588
Really ok.

2522
02:20:27,911 --> 02:20:30,963

2523
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:31,897

Just one more time.

02:20:40,351 --> 02:20:40,684
Yeah.

2527
02:20:40,684 --> 02:20:53,291
Cuddles hmm.

2528
02:21:04,413 --> 02:21:05,480
Goodnight.

2529
02:21:06,364 --> 02:21:07,631
So, Paul.

2530
02:21:08,732 --> 02:21:09,515
OK, OK.

2531
02:21:10,566 --> 02:21:11,700
Take care.

02:21:13,534 --> 02:21:15,819

02:22:19,084 --> 02:22:21,818
I hope that I'll be able to handle

2551
02:22:21,818 --> 02:22:24,003

2552
02:22:24,836 --> 02:22:27,871

You guys start hype train before I leave.

02:22:54,785 --> 02:22:58,470
What's why would you start a hiring before
I had a job offer today?

2562
