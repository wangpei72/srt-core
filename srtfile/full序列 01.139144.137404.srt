00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,325
（song）

2
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:04,392

3
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,376
Yeah, I saw.

4
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,909
I saw when I switched over.

5
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,027
Hey, I didn't think.
I didn't say anything.

6
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,760
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

7
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,510
It's early.

8
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,794
It's like 7 a.m..

9
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:18,427
I am.

10
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,044
I am sleepy.

11
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:22,845
I just woke up like not too long ago.

12
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:25,778
I'm getting grief already. It's.

13
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,429
It happens.

14
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,462
It happens, guys.

15
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,179
Oh, God.

16
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:34,113
OK, well, good morning, everybody.

17
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,396
what's up*3

18
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,463
as a gallon of yard.

19
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:41,430
Hopefully everybody enjoyed their
all their time last night. I.

20
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:42,364
I was.

21
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:47,431
I had a great time of all the all
the funny videos you guys submitted, and

22
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:49,365
it was.

23
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:52,565
I still can't stop thinking
about the fucking kayak.com.

24
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,783
They are obviously
everyone's having a great

25
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,733
or everyone had a great weekend already.

26
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:01,967
And you're excited
for this fucking collab.

27
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,134
Wow. Now, I didn't even start, and.

28
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:06,901
Holy shit,

29
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:09,334
Yeah,

30
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,902
this game has not even started yet,
and I'm already losing my shit.

31
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,052
Not. Not too much, but just a tad bit.

32
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:16,802
Okay.

33
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,819
Like it's ever so slightly

34
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:24,437
getting to the point where I want to,
like, wrap my my fingers around his neck

35
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:29,671
and just squeeze the life out of him
slowly and slowly and slowly.

36
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,321
And give him maybe give him a kiss
on the cheek, and that's it.

37
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:35,421
Yeah, well, it.

38
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:40,689
You know, it's to be expected when you are
I feel like anytime anytime I collab for

39
00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:45,423
EN niji boy, I end up losing my shit
at some point in time.

40
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:48,073
Right. They just were fond of this.

41
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,757
It's. It's does not take too long.

42
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:53,524
It really doesn't take that long, guys.

43
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:54,541
Poor mysta, though.

44
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,224
What do you mean, poor mysta?

45
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,908
What about poor me?

46
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,042
Huh? Well, what are you talking about?

47
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,725
Poor mysta.

48
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:04,542
what the fuck are you talking about?

49
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,692
Poor shoto, though, dude.

50
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:09,726
Oh, come on, dear. Shoto.

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,926
Today is my.

52
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,227
Oh, my goodness.

53
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:15,260
Where all this bullshit bothers you?

54
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:17,444
Oh, do you say? OK.

55
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:18,461
Sorry I didn't get to say it.

56
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,494
Could you say happy birthday up.

57
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,845
Happy birthday.

58
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,528
Hope  you having a great day?

59
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,662
I feel like at this point, every stream
will, like, encounter somebody's birthday

60
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,096
and are opting for the donation.

61
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,563
And just thank you
for the tiny gifts of suppositories.

62
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,247
Good morning, dudes.

63
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm probably going
to have alerts off the screen

64
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:42,631
just because to, you know,
have out of respect for

65
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:48,315
what's it disrespect for the
the collab and just make sure, like,

66
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,865
nothing gets,
you know, interrupted while we play.

67
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:54,999
But I will read through the donations
when I do have time, though,

68
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,133
so do not Do not to worry.

69
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,683
My dear children and guild members.

70
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:01,833
It is OK

71
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,451
Happy birthday.

72
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,034
Happy birthday, bro.

73
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:09,251
Happy birthday Audi ok.

74
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,285
But I'm really excited for this game.

75
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:14,502
I don't have any idea what it's I.

76
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,736
I just know like we had to break out
of prison of each other and

77
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,553
I don't know if you saw last time

78
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:24,753
we had that kind of
collaboration, it's kind of

79
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:27,820
it was kind of scuffed.

80
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,821
OK, I'm going to turn off the lights right
now, actually.

81
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,371
Yeah, it was a really fucking scuffed
because Bunnymen

82
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:38,655
I've never like,
I've never sweated that much.

83
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,906
I've never yelled out much.

84
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:44,523
I've never lost my mind that much silencer
in the fucking dog years.

85
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:45,223
Oh, my. God.

86
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:46,806
Why do you do. This, guys?

87
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,123
Why the fuck do you do this? I'm

88
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,124
you know, one know they're going to go

89
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,558
fuck you.

90
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:00,542
OK? But yeah, so

91
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:01,625
god, I lost y.

92
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,842
What the fuck was I saying?
What the hell was I even saying, dude?

93
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:04,692
Yeah.

94
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,626
So last time we had a collaboration,

95
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,360
and once I'd say it went pretty OK.

96
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:17,377
A little cave, man,
we fucked around, like, quite a bit,

97
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:21,428
and I may or may not have lost my mind
by the end of it.

98
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,695
So much so we started stress eating, dude.

99
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:25,895
We we had to, like.

100
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:27,345
There was.

101
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,846
Like, 2 hours in.

102
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:32,896
He was in a bag of chips, and I was eating
jerky, and he never eats on stream

103
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,763
unless, like, you know,
he gets, he gets to a point like that.

104
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,414
Pushed him to a point.

105
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:41,981
I push off points, you OK.

106
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,598
I think I'm ready, though,
so give us a break.

107
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,715
No, I will not.

108
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:48,698
I'm not do that.

109
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:50,165
That's earned those boxer

110
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,649
can't just ask for it willy nilly like I'm
just going to give it to you for free

111
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,616
right now.

112
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,983
There's no free barks in this household
sometimes.

113
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,467
Also, thank you for the hygiene, guys.

114
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,817
I didn't get to say thank you for that.

115
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:04,267
Sorry, but ba ba ba ba

116
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,068

117
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,251
Ah, thank you for all the resources, guys.

118
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,752
Appreciate it. Welcome back.

119
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,602
OK, I think he's ready now.

120
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,135
So I'm going to switch over to the game.

121
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:15,736
All right?

122
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,753
Yeah. hold on

124
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,670
Well, there I am.

125
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,404
The actor

126
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,421
Da Vinci.

127
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:32,321
Yes, I know. Da Vinci.

128
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:33,338
I know him.

129
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,139
The one from the Titanic.

130
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,222
Da Vinci.

131
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:47,157
Oh, he taught we.

132
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:49,807
Oh, yeah, we. Talked about that.
We talked about this last time.

133
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:50,590
You know this very.

134
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,874
We talked about this last time ,mysta.

135
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,058
What do you mean?

136
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:58,125
We literally talked.

137
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,492
Did we not talk about this?

138
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,825
I swear to God, it.

139
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,859
We did. Yeah, we did. We did.

140
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,742
So I just like gaslighting you.

141
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,676
I was talking about in my chat just now.

142
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,443
Well, OK. Well, good morning.

143
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,393
Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,927
My blood pressure is high already.

145
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,794
That's fucking great, man. Let's go.

146
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,161
I'll be ready to break out of jail today.

147
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:21,811
Oh, shit.

148
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,345
OK. Sorry.

149
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,079
So what will. Happen?

150
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:26,562
What you do?

151
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:30,963
I want to make sure my got a picture
of my face on the screen, like.

152
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,663
Zoomed in really fucking close.

153
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:35,047
Oops.

154
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:35,897
I don't know.

155
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:38,380
I think that's not valid.
I show them your beautiful face.

156
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:39,164
I know. Right?

157
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:42,548
I was getting a sense already because
apparently any sense of this game, we.

158
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,931
Have to censor this. Game.

159
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,015
Apparently, there's like a scene
where you have to censor.

160
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:48,315
I don't know when, though.

161
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,532
Ah. Oh, shit.

162
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,266
Well, I didn't know that, hon.

163
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:52,482
What?

164
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:53,916
You had to censor this fucking game?

165
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,999
Are you kidding?

166
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,133
Hold on.

167
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,017
Let me get a censor image to.
I don't know if you're a yes.

168
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,884
Are you sure you're not? Yes.
I mean. Then you're being for realising I.

169
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,034
My chat said so.

170
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,901
OK, so my chat would never lie to me.

171
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:10,302
That's fucking Calvin,
you know, as fucking calves.

172
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,702
Shut the hell up, OK?

173
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,202
We find a good image.

174
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:18,436
Can you give me a good image?

175
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,386
A good image?

176
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,553
When I used image, I'm using.

177
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,370
What Never mind.

178
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:27,371
I'll end up.

179
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,121
I'll just use this. In this case.

180
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,521
Yeah,
I'll put it in the middle of the screen.

181
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,088
OK, I'm ready now.

182
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,555
What did you get arrested for?

183
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:40,022
I got arrested for being too
fucking funny.

184
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,723
Too funny, too attractive ,too sexy, too top.

185
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:49,474
Too top? was it in your title right now.

186
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,524
Can you read out your title?

187
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:53,524
My title? Yeah. Your streams.

188
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:55,525
I tell ya, some.

189
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,875
That's some contradictory.

190
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,225
So you could
you play a way out with Shoto? OK.

191
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,926
Oh, you are a motherfucker.

192
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:03,842
You're such a whore.

193
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:04,776
You know what happened?

194
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,576
You must like I was about
I was Larry about to start stream.

195
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,043
Right?

196
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,327
You're like, oh, here's the new link.

197
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,427
Must be out of it.

198
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,294
And I was I was like, oh, shit.

199
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,244
I had to readjust.

200
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:19,845
Everything now because the original
he died this asshole.

201
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,862
That's not my fault.

202
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,562
I, I don't,
I don't usually do this shit man.

203
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,962
I don't collab with people.

204
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,746
The fuck are you calling me?

205
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,930
Special oh, you don't want.

206
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,780
No. I'm just saying
I don't collab with people.

207
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,531
But the fact that you're collabing with me
means, like,

208
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:42,181
and you don't collab with people often
means that you like me or you like(muah, muah,muah)

209
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:46,965
your breath smells.

210
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,699
It stinks. It stinks.

211
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:49,599
Get the fuck away.

212
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,982
Brush your teeth.

213
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:57,067

Wong. Hold on, hold on. Don't do it.

216
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,484
Don't be that way. Don't be that way.

217
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,651
I can. OK, you're not haunted.

218
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,668
I'll do something.

219
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,935
I'll do something
a little sweet for you, OK?(muah)

220
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,786
Non. You didn't see it on your side,
but people saw it on my side.

221
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:18,970
But on any side, just my moderator's
I it's get rid of you.

222
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:24,187
Get rid of me, get rid of me

223
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,854
No, what the fuck?

224
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:31,538
All that's that's like that's like
bottom of the barrel type of disrespect.

225
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,255
Come on, honey.

226
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,838
Come on, man.

227
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,405
You know what?

228
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,705
Your breath smells beautiful.

229
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,556
It smells great. Delicious.

230
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,156
I would.

231
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:42,640
I would put it in their perfume bottle and
spread all over myself every single day.

232
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,507
That's just how much I love your breath.

233
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,273
That's how much I love how much you smell.

234
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:47,524
You smell good.

235
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,291
I love the way your feet smell at night.

236
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:54,991
Oh, God.

237
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:58,425
Anyways,
I'm going to get start over again.

238
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,775
I'm going to get started again.

239
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,726
I'm going to click start right now, OK?

240
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:05,043
And just see what happens oh.

241
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:07,293
Connected with. Shoto.

242
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,393
What's your plan after this?
Like some love and shit.

243
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,627
I don't know,

244
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,977
but I thought about it.

245
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,827
You haven't thought about it?

246
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,494
Though. Must be he.

247
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,895
Talking about the universe. No.

248
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:19,178
Vastly different.

249
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,162
Nothing. Nothing. Thinks I'm being smart.

250
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:23,645
Leo, are you implying that I'm not smart?

251
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,562
Or words? I'm smart.

252
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:30,496
Hey, I might not be smart in your book,
but I do get shit done.

253
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:31,996
Exactly.

254
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:32,563
I like that.

255
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,630
Are you with that? Bam!

256
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,964
We got the right characters
for each other.

257
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,914
Oh, no. We get to. Choose. Hold on. Wait.

258
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:42,781
We could be. Someone.
You can be Leo Caruso.

259
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,532
Crime, armed robbery.

260
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,715
Wait a second. Personality.

261
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:46,965
Yeah.

262
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:51,216
Let's just don't discipline reserved,
confident, short tempered joker.

263
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,350
Sweetheart, this person is

264
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,134
after earning a college degree in finance
and marrying his high school sweetheart,

265
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,634
Vince installed in the job in banking.

266
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:01,901
What the hell

267
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,784
embezzlement, murder and fraud.

268
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,102
Y'all, let's go.

269
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,936
What the fuck. Shoto, murder.

270
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:18,003
Murder is a murder
is something it's murder is OK.

271
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:19,153
Sentence.

272
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,370
Oh, what. Did you do? 14 years.

273
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,687
I live six months.

274
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,387
Grand theft. Oh, wait there.

275
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:26,137
Well, I I.

276
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:28,988
Could actually see you
committing grand theft auto.

277
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,755
OK? Is that when you steal a car?

278
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,122
Yeah, I think that's when you steal a car,
right?

279
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,222
Yeah, that's when you steal a car. One
I think so.

280
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:37,722
OK, you know, I'm joking.

281
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,823
How have these options

282
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:41,906
yeah. Yeah.

283
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:43,423
Let's get all of this

284
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:45,640
dude.

285
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,757
I fucking forgot my name.

286
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,941
shoto. shoto? No.

287
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:52,774
You dip.

288
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:56,392
I'm obviously I'm so glad I did.
Yeah. Fuck.

289
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,659
Shut the fuck up. Don't call me a debt.

290
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,159
What is that?

291
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,526
I've never had
anyone could be a dip before.

292
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,143
What does that even mean?

293
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:05,743
When you wouldn't, you lost your mouth.

294
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,510
Wouldn't you like to know a dip?

295
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,710
These balls.

296
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:11,027
I wish.

297
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,027
I wish I had my heart rate monitor on
right now.

298
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,161
You could see it probably just spiked
up, like.

299
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,845
Oh, am I making you flustered?

300
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:17,345
No, you're not.

301
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:17,611
Make me.

302
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:18,295
Feel.

303
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:23,679
OK. Like we haven't even started
playing the game.

304
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,179
Let's control ourselves.

305
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:27,729
How about we be civilised
for maybe 10 seconds, OK?

306
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:30,613
And and why are we going into prison?

307
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,380
Yeah, you're going to prison, babe.

308
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,914
Isn't this romantic?

309
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,614
And it's fucking romantic, right? Date.

310
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,914
Can we go in the shower together?

311
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,214
I think we can, actually.

312
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:45,248
Oh, I mean, you offered, so you can't.

313
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,115
You can't just pull out
or you want to pull out.

314
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:48,066
You're not going to pull out on me.

315
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:50,316
Yeah, you know,
I've never pulled out in my life.

316
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:50,866
All right?

317
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,666
That's what I like to hear.

318
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,683

319
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,784
Yeah. You ain't got no drifted.

320
00:15:58,784 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,901
Are you talking about.

322
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,751
Look at my dress shirt.

323
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,835
Not shit has the patterns.

324
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,402
You saying I have no drip dribble.

325
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,802
No drip.  way to see me?

326
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:11,686
OK, ok. OK.

327

I have floral. What the hell do you have?

329
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:18,286
You're going to have a plain white
dress shirt. No.

330
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,003
Wait forever.

331
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:23,054
You're probably already here.

332
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,304
Yeah,
I'm going to be right here. Right now.

333
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:27,788
Ask me on the bench. Look at that. Yep.

334
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:28,871
That's me.

335
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,205
You think that's drip?
Do you have a white shirt?

336
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,672
You have a white shirt.

337
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,689
You just have a single white t shirt.

338
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,506
Oh, look at me.

339
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:37,406
Shirt.

340
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,306
Fuck off.

341
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:42,557
Fuck off, darling.

342
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,074
OK, well, on.

343
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:48,241
I don't know. How I jog.

344
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,108
Ooh. Hold on.

345
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,808
Wait a minute. Just
I'm going to introduce myself real quick.

346
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,425
I'm a little bit smaller,
even smaller till now.

347
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,292
They see the game, OK?

348
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,309
Oh, yeah.

349
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,409
I guess I just was outside.

350
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,660
Yeah, I. That's enough. It's OK.

351
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,410
What do you think? Chat.

352
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,943
Should I make, like, small or not?
Get off.

353
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,061
This. Hmm.

354
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,561
I think this is good enough for me.

355
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,778

Oh, my God, man, this place is bad. It's.

I don't know. I'm not.

403
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,276
I can't survive in here.

404
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,843
I don't belong in here, man.

We're having two conversations lot.

The worst mistake.

418
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:31,213
Ok, stop.

419
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,580
No inmates behind this point.

420
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,714
Can I go potty?

421
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:35,281
Get in there.

422
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,748
Oh, yeah. Pop me down, baby.

423
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,165
No, he

424
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:40,865
he touched somewhere.

425
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,965
Edition of what the hell.

426
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:43,632
Did you read?

427
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:44,199
He really.

428
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,182
I didn't get to see him.

429
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:48,216
Oh, you can you can do it yourself.

430
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,449
Yeah, I'm
probably got pads on eventually. Oh.

431
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,117
That's all right.

432
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,634
Let me in.

433
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,034
I can't believe you just.

434
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:59,984
Said love and. Such. You are. So

435
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,251
what does that cause?

436
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,385
I think that that caught me off guard.

437
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:09,585
I can't stop thinking about it
like you really threw a curveball. OK,

438
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,203
where am I going?

439
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,286
Oh, he pushed me.

440
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:19,153
No Internet duty fucking pushed me.

441
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,421
You got punched. Oh, shit.

442
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,188
Hey, are we good?

443
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,454
Are you guys good?

444
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:26,955
I think so.

445
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,672
For some reason, my chat just a oh, god.

446
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,389
I think we get

447
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:35,772
privileges now.

448
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,656
OK, cool. Yeah, it's just a bit of lag.

449
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,373
Yeah, but a lag
I think YouTube's being a bit funky.

450
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:45,541
Get undressed. Wait.

451
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,491
They want me to undress, right?

452
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:49,291
Do I have the sense of you?

453
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,658
I think you're going to be naked.

454
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,575
I think they're not going to show an EP.

455
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,692
I'm pretty sure it's OK. Like, Oh, my God.

456
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:03,343
You two break it up now.

457
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:04,510
It heals this guy.

458
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,827

00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,345
This is fine.

464
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,262
Look at my ass.

465
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,362
See, this is why I am.

466
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:23,229
I'm glad I drove this OK?

467
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,396
My head censoring it.

468
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,496
Oh, my God. I think I'm fine.
I think I'm fine.

469
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:27,730
Are we good?

470
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:28,813

I'm. I'm trying. I'm trying.

475
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:39,015
I'm trying to shut up.

476
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,715
I was trying to cover. OK.

477
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,115
What do you mean?

478
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,165
There's a full on cock.
I didn't see a cock.

479
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:44,915
Did you was a cowboy.

480
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:47,082
Was there really a cock up the coffee one?

481
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,733

00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,533
All my stop gaslighting me.

483
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,883
There's no way I didn't see one.

484

You are a.

485
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,284

Where is it? Where is it? OK,
ok. I have it on my screen now.

489
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:05,835
Why is the screen size changing?

490
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:08,535
It's changing, dude. I don't.

491
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,502
I can't tell you.

492
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:09,702
All right.

493
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,853
Well, and this is my present.

494
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:14,703
This isn't going to work.

495
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:15,370
Yeah.

496
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:20,054
When are we allowed in here?

497
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:22,537
Uh, well, I'll just chill here.

498
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:23,621
I guess

499
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,121

500
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,588
Oh, my. God. Guys.

Just imagine a bunch of naked guys right

502
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:33,306
It's censored.

503

We're fine.

504
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:36,589
We're fine. They censored it for us.

505
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,873
You all walk around.

506
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,873
Interesting picture.

00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,890
Wow. Go, go, go. Nice.

518
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,777
What do you mean? It looks better.

519
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,344

00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,162
Why is it offensive, dad?

524
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,229

Why are you getting mad at me?

529
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,548
I was just walking up the stairs, huh?

530
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,115
Yeah, that was you, Dad.

00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:38,781

00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:41,799
Obviously, it's going to be me.

534
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,399

He should be happy he's on the outside.

633
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,513
Oh, he might be on the outside.

Could you walk you, please?

As soon as I get stronger during that
new phase, all they told me in.

What are you doing?
You're getting beat up myself.

My moves. Are so play.

I'm not just.

664
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,590
I'm a seasoned veteran.

665
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,307
You killed someone. That makes sense.

666
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,858
Yeah. Oh.

667
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:45,824
Oh, right.

668
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,708
Shot the left jab oh.

669
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,075
I mean, it's all for Theft Auto.

670
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,492
Oh. Yeah.

671
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,525
All right, just imagine the muscle car.

672
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,609
Of the car.

673
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:56,676
Bomb, bomb?

674
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:59,543
I fucking hate cars. Fuck you. Fuck you.

675
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,027
What blow it.

676
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:05,861
Just imagine as a car because you commit.

677
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,161
Grand Theft Auto.

678
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:07,878
Yeah.

679
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:14,095
Last stop.

680
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:15,695
Order.

681
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,546
Break it up
before I put you all in solitary.

682
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:20,496
Oh, God, please. No, that's actually fake.

683
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,029
Celebrate your back.

684
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,097
It's when they put you in those rooms
and restrained you so you can't move.

685
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,797
Oh, my God.

686
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:29,431
With me. OK.

687
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:31,681
That's kind of kinky.

688
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,181
Stop that.

689
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,165
It's like sensory deprivation.

690
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,315
OK, maybe you would like that.

691
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:39,315
I feel like I'm, like, bondage.

692
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:41,316
I mean, you're not wrong, Mysta.

693
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:42,332
But.

694
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,349
I don't.

695
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,383
I don't think anybody's going to be, like,

696
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:51,400
tickling your balls or, like, squeezing
your nips during that entire thing.

697
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,117
You're just going to be. Oh, no.

698
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:55,417
Going to happen when I get what I.

699
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:56,834
Got all day.

700
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,951
All right, you're saying
that, like, it happens often.

701
00:29:59,318 --> 00:29:59,768
Next.

702
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,535
Where are you, huh?

703
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:06,286
Wow. You're in the cafeteria.

704
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:08,619
Yeah. Hey, there I am.

705
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:10,353
Are you going to sit with me?

706
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,103
Yeah. Yeah. Tell me I am friends.

707
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,203
You're bitch.

708
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,454
You're my friends.
You go find a place of your own.

709
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,671
What the fuck do you mean
you have friends?

710
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:20,221
We have. Friends.

711
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,471
I mean, OK, look. Look over here.
Look over here.

712

Free seat. 

714
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:27,105
I want to eat.

715
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,739
Hey, is someone talking?

716
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,656
No. Oh, my fucking God. Here.

717
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:34,156
Anyone? Get out the way, man.

718
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:35,473
Me neither.

719
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:37,757
Oh, yeah.

720
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:39,707
Show them force.

721
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,674
Don't fuck with me when I'm hungry, OK?

722
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,441
We got a tough guy over here.

723
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,391
I'm just eating and drinking it.

724
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,558
All right,
what are you going to do about it?

725
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:49,408
Know what?

726
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:52,609
San Jose. Oh, my God. Oh, shit, man.

727
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:53,776
Relax, OK?

728
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,126
Go fuck.

729
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,910
Eat this is some good beans.

730
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,393
That's my fault, motherfucker.

731
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,477
He's sick.

732
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,494
So sorry. It's not talking to me.

733
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,577
Why am I walking like this?

734
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,294
What the fuck is going on?

735
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,744
Yeah, I think. I think. All right.

736
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:08,528

737
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:10,095

00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,312
OK, got it. Yeah.

You think this is get lost, right?

00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,062
Hey, you hear that call?

00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,446
Oh, my fucking God. Really? Dave, ready?

743
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:21,846
To wait. A second.

744
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,480
Wait a second.

745
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,547
No, this ain't cool. Oh.

746
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:28,214
Oh, my fucking God.

00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:28,714

748
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:29,797
I got involved.

749
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,931
All these made me fucking jump.

750
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,015
Oh, my God. Slade.

751
00:31:34,515 --> 00:31:35,765
You killed him.

752
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:36,432
Oh, no, no.

753
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:38,582
I got to step down.
I just killed that guy. What the fuck?

754
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:40,532
Oh, he's alive.

755
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,883
No. Oh, no.

756
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:48,883
Fuck her.

757
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:50,200
I'll kill you.

758
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,400
Oh, yeah.

759
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:53,917

763
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:04,002
Throw shit at some fucking hell. What?

764
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:06,352
He literally was times-I was.

765
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:08,153
That was like a metal get sort of mean.

766
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:10,753
That's what all fuck it is is
so we don't know what she did.

767
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,137
Oh, I just use my special technique.

768
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,237
From both.

769
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:14,620
Sides.

770
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,721
But, you know, that's gonna

00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,571

00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,705
No, you better not say.

773
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:25,072
Oh, my God, I'm so scared. Christ.

774
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,805
Russ, that wasn't

775
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:29,156

776
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:31,506
Don't kill me.

777
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:32,289
I'm sorry

778
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,923
I didn't see the next chapter.

779
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:35,773
Please.

780
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,407
Oh, God. Yeah. Come on. God.

781
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,291
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

782
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:44,825
Oh, my God. He actually killed him.

783
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,725
What the fuck?

784
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:47,792
Yeah.

785
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,592
Oh, yes. Oh.

786
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:51,675
Oh, my God.

787
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:52,959
That could have been you.

788
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,993
Yeah, I thought you.

789
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:58,360
I thought I'm strong. Mm.

790
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,260
E Well.

791
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,993
You've been built to deal worse.

792
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:02,494
He's not a car.

793
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:06,311
Oh. And now I get the hotness.

794
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:08,645
Shit. Easy.

795
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,178
I hate those things.

796
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:10,995
80, baby.

797
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:13,562
Worse things to worry about in here.

798
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:14,562
See this?

799
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:16,112
You don't get this.

800
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,013
What? You're getting injected.

801
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:20,596
I'll get injected. Oh.

802
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:22,596
No. I get touched by a hot nurse.

803
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:25,214
All right,
just lay down and rest for a while.

804
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:28,181
Mm. Well, yeah. Nice

805
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:34,381
oh, look, I'm checking out.

806
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:34,832
Oh, yeah.

807
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:38,715
I think you you're oh.

808
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,516
Screwdrivers. Oh.

00:33:50,984 --> 00:33:53,167
Listen, thanks vincent.

814
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:55,951
I'm Vincent.

815
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,035
You're Vincent, and I'm Leo.

816
00:33:58,051 --> 00:33:59,552
I mean it, man.

817
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,585
What's your beef with that guy anyway?

818
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,803
Let's just say it's a long story,
but don't worry, OK?

819
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:08,603
He's out of the picture now. All I a.

820
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,036
He was engaged.

821
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:12,320
Pansies. I need what's that exactly?

822
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,537
You're very reserved right now.

823
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:16,304
You got a cover all over you.

824
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,304
I just need you to watch my back.
Well, I get it.

825
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:18,821
That's all.

826
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:22,272
Your poses is very

827
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:24,789
provocative thing.

828
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:25,572
I'm not interested.

829
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,856
OK, I'll do it myself. Well, all right.

830
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,156
Well, you can't just walk out of here.

831
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:32,440
Of course I can.

832
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,307
We're going to both end up in the hall.

833
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,340
Well, I don't have a choice.

834
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,874
All right, all right.

835
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:37,474
OK, ok.

836
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,907
You know,
we finally get to play with each.

837
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:40,624
Other in court.

838
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,574
Oh, my God.

839
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:44,741
OK, teamwork. Keep your eye sharp.

840
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,092
Yeah. All right, you better fuck this up.

841
00:34:48,092 --> 00:34:50,142
I don't know what I have to say.
What are you going to.

842
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:52,442
You better not fuck it up.

843
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,459
I have never fucked up
anything in my life.

844
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,526
Assist skill.

845
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:57,193
Hold on. Wait.

846
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:58,277
Wait a second.

847
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,193
That's impressive. G

848
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,911

849
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:05,044
What are you doing?

850
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:07,294
We have an inmate on the run, Mysta.

851
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,595
Mysta. You ladies walked out

852
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:13,562
in front of everybody

853
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,879
all i god.

854
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,946
All right, hold on. Wait, g.

855
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:19,329
I'll distract a nurse. Just watch.

856
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,763
I'll distract the nurse. How?

857
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:23,380
Get back in bed.

858
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,597
Get back in j. OK, I'm gonna call her.

859
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,564
I'll call for her right

860
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:32,081
and then I think you can walk away.

861
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:32,681
Uh huh.

862
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:36,782
So now I get the nurse.

863
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:37,932
Fuck you.

864
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,616
Oh, damn you.

865
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:43,566
You're going for it.

866
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,917
What the fuck?

867
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,867
Can I have some water?

868
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,551
Yeah, sore throat.

869
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:51,301
Can I have some water.

870
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:52,034
Ways.

871
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,251
Next move. Ooh.

872
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,268
What the fuck are you doing?

873
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,018
All right.

874
00:35:59,018 --> 00:35:59,885
Where do I go?

875
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:01,902
I don't know. That's up to you, buddy.

876
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:04,186
I'm here. I'm doing my job.
You do your job.

877
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:07,586
There's a guy here.

878
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:08,636
He's got

879
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:13,504
I hope I'm not bothering you.

880
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,171
Cisco. It's my job.

881
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,054
Do, do, do.

882
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:20,471
Do it, do it, do it. Dude,
this is all you.

883
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:22,272
This is literally all you right now.

884
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:24,372
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.

885
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:29,506
I thought you fucked up, OK?

886
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:31,656
What do I do?

887
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,556
I think it is a decent.

888
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,907
Thing that you end up working in a prison.

889
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,607
Can you do anything,
like bang on a window or something?

890
00:36:37,874 --> 00:36:39,907
I don't know how to bang on the window.
Oh, wait, hold on.

891
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:41,974
Oh, you're right. E

892
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,558
it's, like, right behind you.

893
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:45,525
Oh, shit.

894
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,709
I dropped the bomb. No.

895
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,026
You look a bit pale.

896
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,293
Something wrong?

897
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:56,343
Well, I'll knock on it after, ok? OK.

898
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,960
After she looks away, because you can't be
looking at me, I think.

899
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,527
Oh, all right.

900
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:01,894
I'll just sit here.

901
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:06,011
Ok? Go, go, go, go, go, go.

902
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:07,811
Let me go. Let me go.

903
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:12,745
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh.

904
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,112
Oh, my God.

905
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,329
Oh, my God. You are so lucky.

906
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:18,963
You are so lucky. What was that?

907
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,363
What was that timing?

908
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:24,697
Mm hmm.

909
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:27,881
Oh, where's he going?

910
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:30,164
Oh, something else.

911
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,898
That is fine right now.

912
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:32,982
I just got to be fast.

913
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:35,265
Yeah, I am really hungry.

914
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,082
Hurry back. Hurry back. Go.

915
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:37,382
Guys.

916
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,282
In the way

917
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:42,283
how does she not see me?

918
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:45,283
I don't know.
Oh, she's still around. Please

919
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,717
you were just served.

920
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:51,451
I don't know.

921
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:53,168
Give me more. Food.

922
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:54,401
That was disgusting.

923
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:57,485
That was a tiny portion e

924
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,235
come on. What do I do?

925
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,502
Get ready to go. To bed.

926
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:03,186
That was a. Snack.

927
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:06,186
Sorry. That's awfully nice.

928
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,620
Let's go. See this. This is fun.

929
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:11,704
We did. She's gone.

930
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:12,637
It's gone.

931
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,254
She's a ghost.

932
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,921
She's not even real dead.

933
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,372
That was only the first collaboration

934
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:22,505
and you walked right out
in front of the necklace.

935
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:26,172
I couldn't believe what I saw.

936
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:28,173
Hey, what are you up to? Nothing.

937
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,723
Nothing. Bitch.

938
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,573
You know, why are the windows open? Oh.

939
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,824
Oh, they can run away anyways.

940
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,241
But they could jump out.

941
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:39,541
They could, but then everything's
fenced up around the prison.

942
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:41,891
Oh, yeah?

943
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:43,325
Why do we need that for?

944
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:44,625
It's like a. To like is.

945
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,358
A chisel. Yeah, it's a chisel.

946
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:49,876
Basketball

947
00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:53,943
OK. Sitting on a bench.

948
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:54,126
Yeah.

949
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:54,343
Thank you.

950
00:38:54,343 --> 00:38:57,993
My note loser
for the nerd symbiotically nerds.

951
00:38:58,243 --> 00:38:59,344
Oh, look who's here.

952
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,327
Look at the other night. He's lonely.

953
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:03,844
I'm Val. I'm here to keep you company.

954
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:06,911
I felt so bad for you
out of the kindness of my heart.

955
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:10,178
I'm coming here to give you companionship.

956
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:11,879
Uh, huh, uh huh.

957
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:14,262
Because you're fucking lonely. I'm lonely.

958
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:16,146
I don't need. You.

959
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,296
I was fine. Being on my own.
You surprised me.

960
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:18,813
See my.

961
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,047
Beard? Look at my beard.

962
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,630
Come on. Your beard. Is ugly.

963
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,914
Oh, you see, that knows about you.

964
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:26,564
You know.

965
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,964
You know what?
I'm going to make me a kiss your.

966
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:31,248
Face sitting on that little sitting
on big noses.

967
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,215
You know why? Why? You fucking. Know why.

968
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:36,766
Look,

969
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:39,733
I appreciate what you did back there,
but you need to back off.

970
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:43,033
I need to back off. I'm trying to be nice.

971
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:45,133
I'm sure a way
for. Me to bust out of here.

972
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,050
But I need to get out of here, too.

973
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,884
How about I bust on your face?

974
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:49,951
Not my problem.

975
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:51,334
Just offering my help here.

976
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,768
You know what? I don't need your help.
I can handle myself.

977
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:56,535
Yeah, Dan,
like you did in the infirmary back there.

978
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,702
OK, ok.

979
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,019
I'm not.

980
00:40:02,352 --> 00:40:04,753
Listen, I'm pretty much in on this.

981
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,020
Just trying to make you understand
that you could really use my help

982
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,987
i like my man. I can handle myself.

983
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:12,971
Oh, yeah. That's very cute.

984
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,488
Yeah. What about harvey? That.

985
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:19,622
Oh, Harvey,

986
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,305
the fuck do you know about Harvey?

987
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:23,622
Who you been talking to?

988
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,122
The walls are standing here.

989
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,889
Let's supposed to believe that.

990
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:27,556
Let's just.

991
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,356
You and me have something in common.

992
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:30,423
We both want him dead.

993
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:36,157
So you like me being pitting you against

994
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:37,774
the chainsaw knuckle? Lt's kind of.

995
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:40,124
How about me, man? Do that again.

996
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:42,425
Maybe not but I want to.

997
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,442
Do you want, like, coffee dog?

998
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,259
I've always wanted to be done
something with that software.

999
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:48,159
I'm going after.

1000
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,509
If you covered on me,
can I like to call you on this?

1001
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,343
Damn sure.

1002
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:51,726
Chaz.

1003
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:52,743
Oh, good.

1004
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:58,394
So fucking snarky.

1005
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:04,144
Why oh.

1006
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:08,012
My goodness.

1007
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:11,562
I can't keep my eyes off you, babe.

1008
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:15,013
OK, maybe you can do that
if you put one finger in the, you know.

1009
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:16,563
Ass? All right.

1010
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,780
Yeah, right. Do you have a deal?

1011
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,797
One finger in the ass, ok?

1012
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:22,114
Yeah.

1013
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:25,114
You can use the other ones for the
for your special technique.

1014
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:28,448
Can I promise you. Your ninja tsu.

1015
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:35,015
Ahh. Alone in my room?

1016
00:41:38,383 --> 00:41:40,900
I'm in the other one right now.

1017
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,783
Are you?

1018
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,483
Oh, hey.

1019
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:46,150
I hear someone jerking .

1020
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,151
You want to jerk with me?

1021
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,618
Yeah, you're finished.

1022
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:52,418
Let's jerk together, bro.

1023
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:54,885
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1024
00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:56,385
It's my plan.

1025
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:57,135
And I decide.

1026
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:59,436
Oh, and you're being
you want to be you. I take Tom.

1027
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:00,636
I want to be in control.

1028
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:02,136
Whatever you say.

1029
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,870
I mean it, man. Follow the story.

1030
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,153
To the beat. Well, Sam.

1031
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:08,620
You didn't know were taking jerky.

1032
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,304
Not seriously.

1033
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:13,354
You know, sure enough.

1034
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:17,971
Oh, all right.

1035
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,855
Oh, we did.

1036
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:23,439
Do we beat the game?

1037
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:26,223
Oh, my God. Joe.

1038
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:27,489
Thanks for joining.

1039
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:30,123
Everyone is back on by.

1040
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:32,173
I'll see you guys tomorrow
for the next stream.

1041
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:34,757
Thank you.

1042
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:36,307
Oh, look at that.

1043
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:37,374
See, we're in the helicopter.

1044
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:40,358
You didn't really have an escape plan,
did you?

1045
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,308
Spoilers.

1046
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:43,692
Of course I did.

1047
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,692
You had an idea. I'll give you that.

1048
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:48,426
I got you out today.

1049
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:50,776
What do you mean, you got all this?

1050
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,043
We got spoilers.

1051
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,193
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, sure.

1052
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,044
But if it wasn't for me,
you'd still be in there.

1053
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:59,894
Don't forget, I saved your ass.

1054
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,294
Twice.

1055
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:02,228
I don't know about that.

1056
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:04,711
Saving my ass part,
but I'll give you this.

1057
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:06,795
It did help out

1058
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:08,195
a little bit.

1059
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,146
And I saw us twice.

1060
00:43:11,146 --> 00:43:12,162
A little bit.

1061
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:13,929
That's fine.

1062
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,429
Now. Whistles

1063
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:18,580
now this.

1064
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:23,281
Is you.

1065
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:25,964
Ever, like, watch
what comes out of your mouth?

1066
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:27,398
Sometimes

1067
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:32,832
think you're.

1068
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:34,065
What does that mean?

1069
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:36,782
Is that saying, guys,
is this a British thing?

1070
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,516
Nah, I saw.

1071
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:43,267
I mean, you know, you see stretched out.

1072
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:46,150
Gapping. So I'm going, OK, I'm

1073
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:49,684
in. I didn't need that visual.

1074
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:51,901
I really didn't need that fucking visual.

1075
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:55,235
You did

1076
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:59,619
OK, get sub is this day.

1077
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,086
Mysta. Mysta.

1078
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:03,753
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's me.

1079
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,286
Fred. Sup?

1080
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:07,770
Oh, good. Fred, what do you want?

1081
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,104
It's Fred.

1082
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,754
You know,
I was thinking of the exact same. Do

1083
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:15,938
sir we could figure something out, right?

1084
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:18,605
Because you're a fucking Kramer. A Muslim.

1085
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:19,538
What are you talking.

1086
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:20,372
You're older than me.

1087
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:23,889
Probably doesn't make you one.

1088
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:25,323
But that's not true.

1089
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:29,623
Yo, hurry up.

1090
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:30,573
We don't have all day.

1091
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:33,124
I am totally 18. Hey.

1092
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:35,641
All right. They're orderly. Yeah.

1093
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,924
I know. All right.

1094
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,958
What are we doing now? We got.
We got to sweep.

1095
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,508
We got to get the chisel. Gets chisel.

1096
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:45,759
Well, the chisel was up there, so you

1097
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:47,559
probably just, like.

1098
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,959
Just grab it. Can we just grab it?

1099
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,993
What the l.

1100
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:54,093
You're the guy who knows
how to get things around here.

1101
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:56,827
Uh, can I just climb.

1102
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:01,261
You a way out of.

1103
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:04,295
Here? Oh, you know,

1104
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:06,278
go back to your funny guy, Bucky.

1105
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:08,345
We've got to get rid of him eventually.
Yeah, he did.

1106
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:10,329
He pushed you.

1107
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:10,929
Let me put you on.

1108
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:12,346
you know what's up?

1109
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:15,513
you better get used to this fucking bitch,
because there's no way out, Powell.

1110
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,797
At least not alive.

1111
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,297
He's mean. OK?

1112
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:24,331
You know, my chat keeps calling me 81.

1113
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:28,365
I'm a mad Madge slob.

1114
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:31,599
This is why I have. To do slob on me.

1115
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,099
Now break

1116
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:38,616
oh. Oh, my God.

1117
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:41,183
You broke in my room. Just broke.

1118
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:43,517
Oh, don't just stand there. Get a new one.

1119
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:45,667
All right, smart.

1120
00:45:45,817 --> 00:45:51,151
Oh, is he going to be suspicious of you
if you break yours or not?

1121
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:51,968
Hold on.

1122
00:45:51,968 --> 00:45:54,302
I don't think I can be. Can I totters?

1123
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:56,135
I'm just mopping. Around.

1124
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:58,202
It looks like you missed a spot.
I got stuff.

1125
00:45:58,202 --> 00:45:58,936
Yeah.

1126
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:01,836
Seems like I had one else. We got here.

1127
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,336
I was looking out and I, like.

1128
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:06,070
Open going up here.

1129
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:10,304
Oh, yeah.

1130
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:11,921
It's my first time.

1131
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:14,555
I'm not sure if I'm liking it,
but I've done worse.

1132
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:16,171
Are you kidding me?

1133
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:18,188
This is the best job you get.

1134
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:22,022
The view, the smell from the tar smell.

1135
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:24,106
Oh, it's perfect.

1136
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:24,406
I don't know.

1137
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,706
Interruptive coming to that

1138
00:46:27,973 --> 00:46:28,907
yeah. I don't want that.

1139
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:31,274
I don't think talking to these guys
is going to get me anything.

1140
00:46:31,274 --> 00:46:33,774
OK, I got to go get a new broom.
Did you break your broom? Yeah.

1141
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,341
How about you go
break your body and join me?

1142
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:36,674
I can't break mine.

1143
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,891
You can't break it? my bro.

1144
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:42,492
Look, stay here, all right? Ow!

1145
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:43,542
Oh! Oh!

1146
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:44,742
Come here, come here, come here.

1147
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:46,292
Get over here to drag this over here.

1148
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,859
Here's what's going to have to stay here.

1149
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,976
Yes, I'm going to start out.

1150
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:56,444
I've got to go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1151
00:46:57,877 --> 00:46:59,411
Oh, you go. Oh, I go.

1152
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,061
What's I go?

1153
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:02,111
I think that's a waitress.

1154
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,862
You go. OK, yeah, that makes more sense.

1155
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:05,478
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
00:47:05,478 --> 00:47:06,695
Again, I'm going to come back in here.

1157
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:08,012
I'm going to be here.

1158
00:47:09,362 --> 00:47:13,079
Like, oh, holy shit.

1159
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:16,447
Looking around, dude,
you took so long to come here.

1160
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:17,497
Keep it up, boys.

1161
00:47:17,497 --> 00:47:20,864
We don't have all day
now. Get back to work.

1162
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:21,847
Yeah, I'm going up.

1163
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,914
I'm going. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1164
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,831
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

1165
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:28,148
Give me the chisel.

1166
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:31,515
The how the fuck are you gonna get back
down.

1167
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,732
By walking in here?

1168
00:47:33,732 --> 00:47:35,833
Well,
if I break my broom again, can't see that

1169
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:39,433
all right, hold on, hold on.

1170
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,117
Give me a second.

1171
00:47:41,283 --> 00:47:42,517
Fuck you, bitch.

1172
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:44,650
Don't look at him. He's going to notice
you heard.

1173
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:46,417
Not alone.

1174
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,034
You're going to distract them.

1175
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,551
And distract him.

1176
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:50,618
I got a distraction.

1177
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,485
What do you want me to do?

1178
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:55,152
Something nice. Touch him.

1179
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:55,835
Touch him.

1180
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:58,186
Where is this guy?
Oh, this guy. Yeah, this guy.

1181
00:47:58,202 --> 00:48:00,519
Oh, e e e.

1182
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:04,153
Hey, can I ask you something?

1183
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:05,170
What's up?

1184
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,337
Being a prison guard,
almost like being in prison.

1185
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:12,338
I mean, you're in here
all the time with us.

1186
00:48:12,938 --> 00:48:15,121
Are you being a smartass?

1187
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:17,438
I mean. Am I being a smartass?

1188
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:18,489
What's with the attitude?

1189
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:20,406
Just making conversation, man.

1190
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:22,539
I'm just trying
to. Go in, and I'm going in here.

1191
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:25,306
And you said I wanted one. Oh, I'm inside.

1192
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:28,507
Leave you alone. Bring Chisel to Fred.

1193
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,657
Whose pride is locked.

1194
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:34,141
Oh, that guy's right. Table, hon.

1195
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:35,858
Vincent, help you.

1196
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:36,758
Where's the door?

1197
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:38,025
Where's your door?

1198
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,242
Yeah. Where is that? It's that one.

1199
00:48:40,242 --> 00:48:41,108
The one on the right.

1200
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:41,708
Of course, it's.

1201
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:45,192
Where are you, an idiot?

1202
00:48:45,276 --> 00:48:46,876
No, not me.

1203
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:47,709
I'm literally.

1204
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:49,126
I'm legitimately confused.

1205
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,877
Where's the door? Go back this one.

1206
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:55,644
Back, back, back, back, back.

1207
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,394
Out my.

1208
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:00,094
There. There's a door right there.

1209
00:49:00,094 --> 00:49:03,245
The door on the right where

1210
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:08,379
there's no door mister,
what are you talking about?

1211
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,996
I don't see a fucking door.

1212
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:11,146
Oh, my God. Shit.

1213
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:13,046
Shoto, I'm going to fucking kill you.

1214
00:49:13,046 --> 00:49:13,446
You can't.

1215
00:49:13,446 --> 00:49:14,680
You can't say this.

1216
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,863
I don't know where the doors
there's a door right here.

1217
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,997
Let me check the door. Here's locked.

1218
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,697
Mop, mop. Mop. Go back to the mop.

1219
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:23,314
Just looking around.

1220
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:25,831
Along, we get back to work.

1221
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:27,398
Oh, shit.

1222
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,682
Holy shit. OK, see the door?

1223
00:49:30,482 --> 00:49:32,082
You see you through the window.

1224
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,483
Look where this one.

1225
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:37,383
Yeah, you're not in there.

1226
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:40,383
Look, you're not there.

1227
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,951
You must stop right there you are.

1228
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:46,434
Holy. So oh, wow.

1229
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:48,434
There's a door right here.

1230
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:51,002
Right away.

1231
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:52,652
I looked over to your screen.

1232
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:55,119
I saw my big fucking face on the window.

1233
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:58,553
I know where you right.

1234
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:00,836
Oh, my God, you're right.
There is the door.

1235
00:50:00,836 --> 00:50:02,887
We didn't see the door there.

1236
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:05,954
I'm so sorry. Jesus Christ.

1237
00:50:06,187 --> 00:50:07,504
You OK?

1238
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,238
So, Don, sorry.

1239
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:12,455
Get rid of the fuck out of here.

1240
00:50:12,805 --> 00:50:15,705
I got to give Fred.

1241
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:17,772
Oh, tragic.

1242
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:20,256
Have this oh,

1243
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:22,406
my God.

1244
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:24,456
Do you see it?

1245
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:26,623
It blended in with the fucking walls.

1246
00:50:27,923 --> 00:50:28,923
Thought I'm.

1247
00:50:28,923 --> 00:50:30,674
Going to not telling your tail on.

1248
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:34,141
Oh, man. Wouldn't you like to do that?

1249
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:35,824
I know it's a fucking flop plug.

1250
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,108
It's not a plug.

1251
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:40,158
You can't touch.

1252
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:41,025
This.

1253
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:42,792
It's a motorised bump flow.

1254
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,626
That's why he's breathing. A little.

1255
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:46,243
Green.

1256
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,360
Or maybe. Maybe it is. Maybe it is.

1257
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,193
And I connect to it like, you.

1258
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:51,943

Little bitch.

1267
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:12,013
I didn't even pay attention to
what the fuck is going on now.

1268
00:51:12,013 --> 00:51:14,763
You were. I knocked.

Oh, shit.

00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,967
Freezing could I have some extra sheets?

1285
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,684
Oh, no, it's not going to happen.

Which is worse to you?

1608
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:07,846
Well, if you're dead, you're dead.

1609
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:11,414
But if you're alive, you just lost a shit
ton of money because your car's gone,

1610
01:03:11,614 --> 01:03:13,397
and you're probably gonna be put in debt,

1611
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:15,781
and your insurance is going to
go off the roof, and you're going to live.

1612
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:17,648
Very sad.

1613
01:03:17,648 --> 01:03:20,231
So that's what I'm saying.

1614
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,515
You have to think. About these things.

1615
01:03:21,515 --> 01:03:24,165
Did you have the pain?

1616
01:03:24,165 --> 01:03:26,716
I don't think you're thinking.

1617
01:03:26,716 --> 01:03:28,033
I I don't care.

1618
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:30,066
I don't think so. I don't know, sir.

1619
01:03:30,283 --> 01:03:30,933
What am I doing?

1620
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:33,517
What is happening?
I wasn't paying attention to my life.

1621
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,783
I was thinking about money.

1622
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,584
OK? I push you and you get stuck.

1623
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:40,534
No, you go inside.

1624
01:03:40,534 --> 01:03:41,251
Oh, fuck.

1625
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,201
What am I supposed to be the dad here?
What?

1626
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:44,235
Smiley daddy?

1627
01:03:44,235 --> 01:03:47,035
You're supposed to call him
Daddy free. Petrified. Right?

1628
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:49,352
That's great.
I would never call you daddy.

1629
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,786
Since you did it last time
during the collab.

1630
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:54,670
No. Yes, you did.

1631
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,253
There's there's little evidence.

1632
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:56,770
Oh, no, no.

1633
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:58,487
I have your number. Please.

1634
01:03:58,487 --> 01:04:00,704
See the rules and regulations.

1635
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:02,371
Not just my number.

1636
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,454
It's the card, man.

1637
01:04:03,454 --> 01:04:06,521
I need your name and number

1638
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,155
convince him.

1639
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:09,822
Hold on, Vince.

1640
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:11,289
What do you think? You're.

1641
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:12,305
What's your name again?

1642
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,556
Little closer.

1643
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:16,656
It's not here. Ow!

1644
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:17,273
Ow! Ow!

1645
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:20,056
Ow! Ow! Get over here, you idiot.

1646
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:21,940
I convinced him.

1647
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,074
Oh, my God. You. You're amazing.

1648
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:25,557
Holy shit. Oh.

1649
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:26,774
Okay.

1650
01:04:26,774 --> 01:04:27,841
All right.

1651
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,658
I guess I'm going to.

1652
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:29,274
All right.

1653
01:04:29,274 --> 01:04:31,391
I'll see you down there. Oh, my God.

1654
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:32,792
Oh, shit.

1655
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:33,392
Here.

1656
01:04:33,492 --> 01:04:36,075
Court
We go this way and those other moves shh.

1657
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,559
Stop talking. Nope.
We're going to get suspicious.

1658
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:39,759
Amongst us. Amongst

1659
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:43,143
us, amongst us, amongst us, amongst
us, amongst us, amongst us, amongst us.

1660
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:45,693
What are you doing?

1661
01:04:45,693 --> 01:04:47,894
Are you trying to shake me around?

1662
01:04:47,894 --> 01:04:51,361
What are you, fucking dick

1663
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:52,628
this is not a shop.

1664
01:04:52,628 --> 01:04:53,645
It's like, you know.

1665
01:04:53,645 --> 01:04:56,195
It's like we're going on a grocery market
ride.

1666
01:04:57,278 --> 01:04:59,195
I'm in the I'm the shopping cart.

1667
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:02,446
It's like back when I was five years old.

1668
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:05,229
Oh, I got in the shopping cart before,
and then it fell on me.

1669
01:05:05,713 --> 01:05:07,180
It fell on you.

1670
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,830
Holy shit.

1671
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,297
It flipped upside down. But I did it.

1672
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:13,514
Yeah. Where are we going?

1673
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:17,431
Oh. This is how we get past today's
laundry. Hi.

1674
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:19,898
What if they check
in? What? They check it.

1675
01:05:21,465 --> 01:05:24,432
Gain access to the back room.

1676
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:25,482
It's the back room.

1677
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:26,416
The back rooms.

1678
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:28,533
You never watch the bathrooms?

1679
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,800
No, I haven't

1680
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,266
Hello.

1681
01:05:31,266 --> 01:05:33,333
Hey, guard, can I ask you something?

1682
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:35,167
Time for. You.

1683
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:36,184
Oh, shit.

1684
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:38,167
You got rejected immediately.

1685
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,734
Sucks the suck.

1686
01:05:40,118 --> 01:05:41,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1687
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:42,485
What are you doing, inmate?

1688
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:44,768
Get away from there. Go to my office.

1689
01:05:45,302 --> 01:05:46,135
He pushed me into.

1690
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:48,552
The push you into me. Wow.

1691
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:50,703
OK, I think you have to go
where the guards.

1692
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:52,686
All right? Unless he doesn't let you.

1693
01:05:52,686 --> 01:05:55,387
He doesn't
let me go in there unless it does.

1694
01:05:55,387 --> 01:05:56,587
And I'm just stupid.

1695
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:57,487
Never mind.

1696
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,387
Oh, no. He's gone. Look, he's
going to look. He's going to look.

1697
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:01,054
Oh, no.

1698
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:03,121
Oh, man. What are you doing?

1699
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:05,288
Come here. Get these guys.
I don't know. I'm.

1700
01:06:05,288 --> 01:06:06,121
I've put them in the hole.

1701
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,422
I mean, what did I.

1702
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:11,505
What did we think was going to happen?

1703
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:13,839
We need to put the sheets in.

1704
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,623
You put in the washing machine.

1705
01:06:15,623 --> 01:06:17,923
To get sheets on top. Of me.
All of they're right here.

1706
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:20,507
Oh, on fire

1707
01:06:21,707 --> 01:06:23,624
on. Yeah.

1708
01:06:23,674 --> 01:06:24,874
OK, bring it over.

1709
01:06:24,874 --> 01:06:27,541
Oh, I think got beat up that dude again.

1710
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,958
I think. No, no, no.

1711
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:29,525
It's open.

1712
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:30,391
Oh, it's open. Open.

1713
01:06:30,391 --> 01:06:33,042
Oh, he's. Still stuck in there. OK.

1714
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:35,492
I think I can just put sheets in now. Hmm.

1715
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,126
How much do we have to put inside
like I should some.

1716
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:42,276
No, I. Don't know

1717
01:06:42,526 --> 01:06:45,794
why you get inside it
and I'll put a sheet on top of you. Ok?

1718
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:49,444
Oh, it just disappeared.

1719
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:50,411
There's no sheets anymore.

1720
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:52,144
Oh, yeah.

1721
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:54,211
You got to put it on me then. OK,

1722
01:06:55,662 --> 01:06:55,995
cover me.

1723
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:57,062
I'll be.

1724
01:06:57,695 --> 01:06:59,312
Back. OK, we're all set.

1725
01:06:59,312 --> 01:07:00,579
Cover yourself.

1726
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:03,879
Oh, you can hide. Ha!

1727
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:06,947
All right.

1728
01:07:08,013 --> 01:07:09,164
See, now.

1729
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:11,714
I don't know how. Me.

1730
01:07:11,714 --> 01:07:13,481
It's impossible. It's impossible.

1731
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:14,981
Fuck this up .Your purity.

1732
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:16,781
Right now literally looks like amongst us.

1733
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,515
I know, right?

1734
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:19,332
You're being real.

1735
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:20,582
Sussy.

1736
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:23,382
Well, yes.Sussy.

1737
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:25,632
Sassy guide.

1738
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:28,233
No. Hi, Fi, you fucking idiot.

1739
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:34,234
You OK.

1740
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,951
See what we have here?

1741
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,284
I'm all right. Looks good.

1742
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,185
Get out of the way.

1743
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:42,552
Oh, he's pushing you.

1744
01:07:42,552 --> 01:07:43,152
Oh, no.

1745
01:07:43,152 --> 01:07:44,018
Oh, no way.

1746
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:44,685
Where am I. Going?

1747
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,785
To get rid of that guard.

1748
01:07:47,886 --> 01:07:51,553
Oh, do I have to convince this
God as well?

1749
01:07:51,636 --> 01:07:53,620
Uh, hey.

1750
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,970
What are you doing?

1751
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,503
I can get to distract him.

1752
01:07:56,503 --> 01:07:57,287
Maybe

1753
01:07:58,354 --> 01:07:59,854
there's going to be a fight.

1754
01:07:59,854 --> 01:08:01,871
I don't know why.
There's always fights and prison.

1755
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:04,121
She's broken, but there's a problem
with that washing machine.

1756
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:06,822
Oh, yeah? What's the problem?

1757
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:07,688
I don't know. It's broken.

1758
01:08:09,572 --> 01:08:09,939
I'll do.

1759
01:08:09,939 --> 01:08:12,339
Where the fuck am I going?
Doesn't look broken.

1760
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:13,839
Stop lying.

1761
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,056
Get back towards

1762
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:19,423
you're wearing me.

1763
01:08:19,423 --> 01:08:21,374
Let me talk to you again. There
going to be a fight?

1764
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:23,024
I think those two. What are you doing?

1765
01:08:23,024 --> 01:08:23,924
I don't know.

1766
01:08:23,924 --> 01:08:24,341
I don't know.

1767
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:25,541
This help.

1768
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:28,541
Over there like that grab. She.

1769
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,941
Can't you not see, dude?

1770
01:08:29,941 --> 01:08:31,208
How does he not see me?

1771
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,175
Get back to work?

1772
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:33,525
Oh, my God.

1773
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:35,676
Oh, shit. OK.

1774
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:37,326
Ok. What the fuck do I do then?

1775
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,226
Hey, come one of you to do something.

1776
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,176
You seem to be having a great day.

1777
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:42,343
You got that shit, right?

1778
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:44,677
You're looking at a free. Man, ok? Shit.

1779
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:47,194
Yep. Next week is my last.

1780
01:08:47,911 --> 01:08:50,294
Oh, I need you in here to help

1781
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:51,911
have fun.

1782
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,895
Oh, I will.

1783
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:57,012
I need to get in the back room,
but I need someone to focus on that.

1784
01:08:57,645 --> 01:08:58,545
Ah the guard's gone.

1785
01:08:58,545 --> 01:09:00,512
First, I'll go to a strip club.

1786
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:03,796
Why are you talking to this guy?

1787
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:07,447
I need to get someone to do something
or the best strip club.

1788
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:11,814
And maybe I can sabotage all.

1789
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:13,264
Oh, no, he's.

1790
01:09:13,264 --> 01:09:15,398
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. He's really right there.

01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,831
He's literally right there.

1792
01:09:16,831 --> 01:09:18,882
Yes, that's sabotage.

1793
01:09:18,882 --> 01:09:21,732
I'll put this. Inside. Of that.

1794
01:09:21,732 --> 01:09:23,232
You fuck what?

1795
01:09:23,232 --> 01:09:24,999
Put it inside it.

1796
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:25,966
I want to put it inside.

01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:28,816
Put it inside. Put inside. OK.

And put. It down. Oh, shit.

1800
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,384
I could just put it down.
What have you done before?

1801
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,934
And then turn it on. Oh, wait.

1802
01:09:38,134 --> 01:09:38,951
I can open the door.

1803
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,201
I can open this door, but.

1804
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:42,368
Ah. Oh, yeah. He has to get the shot.

1805
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:43,185
Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready.

1806
01:09:43,185 --> 01:09:45,602

01:09:58,037 --> 01:09:59,104
OK, ok. OK.

1814

01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:15,515
Why did you just leave?

1962
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:16,665
Give flashlight?

1963
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:19,332
No, he's mine.

1964
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:21,166
Give me the flashlight. No.

1965
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,183
It's my flashlight.

1966
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:23,283
It's my flashlight.

1967
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,966
Flashlight. Flashlight is my flash.

1968
01:15:25,966 --> 01:15:26,917
Hand me the flashlight.

1969
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:31,634
Vincent, hand me the flashlight.

1970
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:34,084
Vincent, hand me the flashlight.

1971
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:36,601
I can get my flashlight.

1972
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:39,585
But you see my face.

1973
01:15:39,585 --> 01:15:41,585
I'm looking.

1974
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:43,352
Look at his face.

1975
01:15:43,352 --> 01:15:45,552
Look at this stone dark.

1976
01:15:46,036 --> 01:15:46,753
Vincent.

1977
01:15:46,753 --> 01:15:49,753
Hello. Is your brain OK?

1978
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,937
I Vincent.

1979
01:15:51,937 --> 01:15:53,804
Vincent, hand me the flashlight.

1980
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:56,737
Here's a flashlight, son.

1981
01:15:57,187 --> 01:15:58,871
Get the fuck out of here. Leo.

1982
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:00,971
Something's wrong with you.

1983
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:05,822
Wow. Something's wrong with me. Wow.

1984
01:16:06,872 --> 01:16:09,072
Rude ass, motherfucker.

1985
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:10,156
Oh, look.

1986
01:16:11,656 --> 01:16:13,640
Now. That's karma, bitch.

1987
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,723
Good, dude. It right there.

1988
01:16:15,723 --> 01:16:17,957
That's just gas. Doesn't matter.

1989
01:16:17,957 --> 01:16:18,940
Is gas poisonous?

1990
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,791
No, oh, here we go.

1991
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:22,808
Shit.

1992
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:24,908
There's gas in your ass.

1993
01:16:24,908 --> 01:16:27,075
Open the door. Be useful.

1994
01:16:27,075 --> 01:16:29,075
Be useful. Help me.

1995
01:16:29,075 --> 01:16:30,909
I got a rock.

1996
01:16:30,909 --> 01:16:31,942
What do you want to do?

1997
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:35,143
All rocket.

1998
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:36,010
Yeah, yeah.

1999
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:39,610
Do it. Nice

2000
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,110
Yeah, yeah.

2001
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:46,011
Good shit.

2002
01:16:46,011 --> 01:16:48,695
Thank you, Leo.
All right, now give me back my flashlight.

2003
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:52,145
No. I need it to see in the dark.

2004
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:53,462
I need to see in the dark, too.

2005
01:16:53,462 --> 01:16:55,329
That was my flashlight. Original. Yeah.

2006
01:16:55,329 --> 01:16:56,429
Just tell you, I.

2007
01:16:56,429 --> 01:16:59,563
I lent it to you. Give it back.

2008
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:01,730
It's my flashlight now.

2009
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:05,314
It's give me back
my fucking flashlight, bitch.

2010
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:06,797
It's mine. I need inflicted.

2011
01:17:06,797 --> 01:17:09,464
I looked it. It was in my ass.
It was in my fucking ghosts.

2012
01:17:09,698 --> 01:17:11,081
It was literally in my ass.

2013
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:12,465
Right now I need. To find. Ghosts.

2014
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:13,931
Give me back my flashlight.

2015
01:17:13,931 --> 01:17:17,282
You Dick! It's my flashlight now.

2016
01:17:18,665 --> 01:17:19,716
Get over here.

2017
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:21,783
Let's bust this up, OK?

2018
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:23,283
You win this time.

2019
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:25,133
I'll remember this

2020
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,317
you remember this?

2021
01:17:27,883 --> 01:17:29,050
Are we supposed to synchronise?

2022
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,667
Ah, bang.

2023
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:31,801
Hold on.

2024
01:17:31,801 --> 01:17:33,901
I think we just keep going.

2025
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:36,518
Oh, hey, see that?

2026
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:38,235
Vincent,

2027
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:40,802
this place is giving me the creeps.

2028
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:43,236
Vincent,
I'll now have to rely on your attitude.

2029
01:17:43,236 --> 01:17:45,736
I can't see anything so dark.

2030
01:17:45,736 --> 01:17:46,719
You're not scared.

2031
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,153
It says a area.

2032
01:17:49,153 --> 01:17:51,303
Which means it's down here.
No, no, no, no, no.

2033
01:17:51,303 --> 01:17:51,887
Look behind you.

2034
01:17:51,887 --> 01:17:55,004
What's down here? What's on your right?

2035
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,971
What's down here? Yeah.

2036
01:17:56,971 --> 01:17:57,671
Let's not rush.

2037
01:17:57,671 --> 01:17:58,621
Let's take a look.

2038
01:17:58,621 --> 01:17:59,505
Enjoy the sights.

2039
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:01,121
Look at this chair.

2040
01:18:02,405 --> 01:18:03,555
Look at this chair.

2041
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:04,605
Holy fuck.

2042
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:06,822
How do I show?

2043
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:10,306
How do I unsub if I got gifted?

2044
01:18:10,306 --> 01:18:13,657
Asof not can follow me. No.

2045
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:15,457
Then come on.

2046
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,207
Come on, baby.

2047
01:18:17,207 --> 01:18:19,724
Yada, yada. Appreciate the gifted sub.

2048
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:21,541
He uses so many emotes.

2049
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,708
Subscribe now off switch prime.

2050
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:25,025
Shut your mouth.

2051
01:18:25,025 --> 01:18:27,392
I would wipe.

2052
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:29,742
That was a guy there.

2053
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,892
You see? Now,
there's some people up there.

2054
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:34,993
We can look up a skirt.

2055
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:36,376
His skirt, all of.

2056
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:38,293
So that's what you're into?

2057
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:39,127
Yeah.

2058
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:41,044
Maybe. Bastard.

2059
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,244
Maybe I'll.

2060
01:18:43,244 --> 01:18:44,077
Hold it.

2061
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:49,262
This way.

2062
01:18:49,262 --> 01:18:50,762
Oh, my God.

2063
01:18:51,162 --> 01:18:53,562
Did someone, like, vacuuming?

2064
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,546
Oh, yeah.

2065
01:18:54,546 --> 01:18:56,496
I know. It's coming from outside.

2066
01:18:56,496 --> 01:18:59,113
Oh, ok. OK.

2067
01:18:59,113 --> 01:19:02,563
I think there's, like, a truck coming by
that's really obnoxious.

2068
01:19:02,597 --> 01:19:03,197
Here.

2069
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,897
Add small ambience is fine. So scary.

2070
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:07,214
I've got an idea.

2071
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:09,548
Turn your back against mine.

2072
01:19:10,865 --> 01:19:12,031
Are you kidding me?

2073
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:15,482
Chest against my best asthma.

2074
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:18,866
It's never going to work. Relax.

2075
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:20,799
The truck. Is solid. Noxious.

2076
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:22,816
You know, it's so obnoxious.

2077
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,533
Oh, wait. What is this?

2078
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:27,517
It'll be much quicker.

2079
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:30,884
You fuck together at the same time.

2080
01:19:30,884 --> 01:19:32,901
Oh, you're

2081
01:19:35,385 --> 01:19:37,702

2082
01:19:38,402 --> 01:19:40,635
Oh, ok. OK. I see what's happening.

2083
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:42,786
Oh, I see.

2084
01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:44,536
What's happening. Yeah.

2085
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:45,953
I see.

2086
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:49,020
This all. Up. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2087
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:51,220
You tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

2088
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,020
You're all alone.

2089
01:19:54,521 --> 01:19:56,504
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo.

2090
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:59,805
Now, Mysta. Mayor,

2091
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:01,505
it's up. To you, ok?

2092
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:02,888
Oh, my God.

2093
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:05,105
Hey, y'all divorced, man. Holy shit.

2094
01:20:05,922 --> 01:20:07,156
I didn't do anything.

2095
01:20:07,156 --> 01:20:07,806
I didn't do anything.

2096
01:20:07,806 --> 01:20:10,240
You just keep going too fast.

2097
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,573
Keep up with the pace, bitch.

2098
01:20:14,073 --> 01:20:16,124
Mysta. Mysta. Mysta.

2099
01:20:16,124 --> 01:20:16,690
Calm down.

2100
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:17,857
Mysta. Misconduct.

2101
01:20:17,857 --> 01:20:19,958
Call them. OK.

2102
01:20:20,474 --> 01:20:21,424
So slow.

2103
01:20:21,424 --> 01:20:23,441
So slow.

2104
01:20:23,441 --> 01:20:26,025
You got to adjust your slow, slow,

2105
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:28,742
slow, slow, slow, slow motherfucker.

2106
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:31,059
Yeah. Yeah. You want talk about slow?

2107
01:20:31,142 --> 01:20:35,776
You want to talk about slow d
just so you'll fucking follow us?

2108
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:36,226
Oh, my god.

2109
01:20:36,226 --> 01:20:37,877
Oh, listen, calm down.

2110
01:20:37,877 --> 01:20:39,360
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2111
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,461
What one fuck up. You got to chill.

2112
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:42,727
You got to chill.

2113
01:20:42,727 --> 01:20:44,644
Oh, shit.

2114
01:20:45,344 --> 01:20:46,845
Oh, my God.

2115
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:49,695
Please, please go off. OK. OK.

2116
01:20:51,045 --> 01:20:52,412
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2117
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:53,712
It's not that hard.

2118
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:56,746
Is not our job.

2119
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:58,663
Stop. Go.

2120
01:20:59,496 --> 01:21:01,113
We have to go at the same time.

2121
01:21:01,113 --> 01:21:03,464
No, we're at a different level.

2122
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:05,714
We go. OK, ok.

2123
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:07,598
No. Fuck that.

01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:10,631
No fuck ups this time for you.

01:21:11,048 --> 01:21:12,965
Take it easy. I'm fucked.

2126
01:21:12,965 --> 01:21:13,482
Calm.

You go now. I'm good. OK, I got. Yeah,

OK. Nice.

01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,633
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2130
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,316
Not only got them so close.

2131
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:22,666
So close. I'm so close.

2132
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:25,300
Yeah. Oh. Oh, my God.

2133
01:21:26,017 --> 01:21:29,251
Are you sure that's team work. Oh.

2134
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:32,834
Huh. Good job, man. Yeah.

2135
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:34,718
I don't like you as much anymore.

2136
01:21:34,718 --> 01:21:35,885
I mean, way I like you, man.

2137
01:21:35,885 --> 01:21:38,619
I like you a. Little bit more.
Yeah, that's what I want.

2138
01:21:40,002 --> 01:21:40,252
Yeah.

2139
01:21:40,485 --> 01:21:42,486
What? I don't like you as much.

2140
01:21:42,752 --> 01:21:45,286
That's so shit.

2141
01:21:46,086 --> 01:21:48,637
The one place you can get that.

2142
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:51,104
Job have to have it.

2143
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:56,304
Such a dick, miss, though
you're such a same way.

2144
01:21:56,321 --> 01:21:58,571
Don't run my body

2145
01:21:59,955 --> 01:22:02,822

2146
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:05,056
Yeah. Where are we going to do
now? We're up here.

2147
01:22:05,056 --> 01:22:07,773
We vented now. Uh.

2148
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:10,240
While we can slip through the cracks.

2149
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,140
You know.

2150
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:13,390
I saw through your crack.

2151
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:18,241
Yeah, like you hear that grunting.

2152
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:21,308
You have a dirty mind ,Shoto.

2153
01:22:21,308 --> 01:22:22,691
I know. I do.

2154
01:22:22,691 --> 01:22:24,192
I embrace it.

2155
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:26,925
You need to be more say so.

2156
01:22:26,925 --> 01:22:28,659
At least in my stream.

2157
01:22:29,142 --> 01:22:34,510
He you were talking about a fucking, like,
universal vibrator.

2158
01:22:34,543 --> 01:22:36,393
Like 10 minutes into the stream.

2159
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,410
You can't say anything.

2160
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,277
To redeem yourself at this. Point.

2161
01:22:40,277 --> 01:22:41,827
I was, like, the first 5 minutes.

2162
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:44,078
It's not even. Worse.

2163
01:22:44,078 --> 01:22:44,761
Not moving.

2164
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:46,178
It doesn't help your case.

2165
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,162
The stuff, that's the points.

2166
01:22:49,212 --> 01:22:51,995
I haven't said anything sexy since then.

2167
01:22:51,995 --> 01:22:53,196
Your you were literally.

2168
01:22:53,196 --> 01:22:55,329
Flaunting your armpit hairs. The
the guard.

2169
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:58,446
You're saying that's notSussy.

2170
01:22:58,446 --> 01:22:59,230
That's going to be hot.

2171
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:00,730
Spit my ass.

2172
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:06,664
Oh, I'm good.

2173
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:07,531
Let me take it.

2176
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:13,032
I'm going to shave this wood
while you go do that, OK?

2177
01:23:13,415 --> 01:23:14,115
What do you want?

2178
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:15,032
Enjoy yourself.

2179
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:17,616
I want a hammer. Yeah. What do you want?

2180
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:18,999
I want a wrench.

2181
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,800
It's all I got to deal

2182
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:22,433

2183
01:23:22,433 --> 01:23:23,650
I have a quick question for you.

2184
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,233
Why are you talking to him?

2185
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,734
What day is that?
Why are you asking about it?

2186
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:28,634
The day, Monday?

2187
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:29,801
Because it's Monday.

2188
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:30,884
I need to know the day.

2189
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:32,951
Stanley, fuck is fine. Oh, man.

2190
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:33,601
You lose track.

01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:36,335
Of that shit here on this guy's pretty.
Nice. You're nuts.

2192
01:23:36,452 --> 01:23:37,852
I'm being. You're nuts.

2193
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:40,719
I going to take the wrench
right from him, then.

2194
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,753
Hey, it's mine.

2195
01:23:42,753 --> 01:23:43,719
It is.

2196
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:46,336
OK, just don't take a hit on somebody
away.

2197
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,903
You come in. Come in, you dummy.

2198
01:23:49,037 --> 01:23:50,654
You could use this fucker.

2199
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,671
You did not look at it.

2200
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:52,954
Look at it. There's a hatch.

2201
01:23:52,954 --> 01:23:54,188
It's a wall.

2202
01:23:54,188 --> 01:23:58,305
No. Come down here
and look at the fucking beds.

2203
01:23:58,838 --> 01:23:59,588
Look at it.

2204
01:23:59,588 --> 01:24:01,389
How are you going to fit down that?

2205
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:02,805
Well, what are we going to do of that

2206
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:06,639
you almost locked me in the corner,
you know that.

2207
01:24:06,756 --> 01:24:08,823
I could move over to this fucking guy.

2208
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:09,790
Look, he's sad.

2209
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:10,773
No, no.

2210
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:13,274
I'm enjoying. My work done to enjoy.

2211
01:24:13,307 --> 01:24:14,590
Myself. OK?

2212
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,124
I'm going to enjoy myself
for a little bit.

2213
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:17,974
You should be patient.

2214
01:24:18,091 --> 01:24:20,741
You want everybody back home, get out.

2215
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:30,043
Let's stop.

2216
01:24:30,043 --> 01:24:31,526
Crying words.

2217
01:24:33,976 --> 01:24:36,910
Is coming.

2218
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:39,494
You get the fucking right.

2219
01:24:39,494 --> 01:24:41,611
Fuck off when I'm leaving.

2220
01:24:42,044 --> 01:24:44,145
What the fuck?

2221
01:24:44,828 --> 01:24:46,962
The only thing.

2222
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,179
My God will be nice.

2223
01:24:50,145 --> 01:24:51,896
I'll never amount to anything.

2224
01:24:51,896 --> 01:24:53,713
You're a bitch.

2225
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:54,496
Well, what am I doing?

2226
01:24:54,496 --> 01:24:55,746
Down here?

2227
01:24:57,046 --> 01:24:59,963
Earlier?

2228
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:03,481
Oh, jeez.

2229
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:05,414
That I've been behind the bin.

2230
01:25:05,414 --> 01:25:08,048
Because I'm so obsessed with these events,
girl.

2231
01:25:08,648 --> 01:25:10,815
Yeah. Why is. I mean, you're soSussy.

2232
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:12,282
Why do you keep. Looking at Vince?

2233
01:25:12,282 --> 01:25:14,382
Oh, no, Vince.

2234
01:25:14,382 --> 01:25:16,449
What's going on, dude?

2235
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:18,583
I can't even do anything with events.

2236
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:19,716
Man. SNAFU.

2237
01:25:19,716 --> 01:25:22,033
Hey, I heard that.
Watch your mouth, inmate.

2238
01:25:22,983 --> 01:25:23,650
What is. It?

2239
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,800
Amber Hey, OK, here's.

2240
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:29,434
They got everything. Do you have
the wrench? I push him into this.

2241
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:31,835
Yeah, like, click, click. I'll talk.

2242
01:25:32,468 --> 01:25:34,268
You got the wrench behind them. OK.

2243
01:25:34,268 --> 01:25:35,585
What do you want?

2244
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:37,085
What do I want?

2245
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:38,552
Yeah, what do you want?

2246
01:25:38,552 --> 01:25:39,936
I want nothing, bitch.

2247
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:40,836
Oh, my God.

2248
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,653
He got fucking.

2249
01:25:43,653 --> 01:25:47,537
Bamboozled for dingle
because he got diddled.

2250
01:25:47,987 --> 01:25:50,287
My guy got it all. You got date.

2251
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:52,087
You got Joe beginning

2252
01:25:53,204 --> 01:25:53,971
show.

2253
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:57,521
What can we do here?

2254
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:59,888
Hello? Sure. I want to walk through.

2255
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,355
Yeah, I think I have to use the wrench
on the vents.

2256
01:26:02,956 --> 01:26:05,406
Oh, what the fuck is this?

2257
01:26:05,406 --> 01:26:06,973
Sabotage. Sabotage?

2258
01:26:06,973 --> 01:26:09,340
Oh, here we go. Here
we go. Here we go for this.

2259
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,940
Oh, we go. That's off the metal detector.

2260
01:26:12,073 --> 01:26:13,957
No, no, no,
no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No.

2261
01:26:13,957 --> 01:26:15,974
I shoves a metal detector.
For what, though?

2262
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:17,474
Come over here.

2263
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:18,974
Come over to the vent.

2264
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,525
OK. Now get over to the vent,
and then I'll give you the other edge.

2265
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:27,609
Oh. I don't know what this is
supposed to do, but, I mean, I got a vent.

2266
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:33,977
Oh, and now I go back
to here, and that was a lock

2267
01:26:36,227 --> 01:26:39,427
in there in it, and I can undo the lock.

2268
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:43,245
Except that doesn't happen,
because that's not what wrenches do.

2269
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,311
What are you doing, dude?

2270
01:26:45,311 --> 01:26:46,595
What the fuck are you doing?

2271
01:26:46,595 --> 01:26:49,862
You're running around, like, living
out of your cock out in the back here.

2272
01:26:50,346 --> 01:26:51,962
And then I'm going to go in this door.
I'm going to.

2273
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:54,429
Go back to cutting board, fuck this guy.

2274
01:26:54,429 --> 01:26:56,496
And then I'm going to walk out.

2275
01:26:56,496 --> 01:26:57,063
Wait.

2276
01:26:57,063 --> 01:26:59,597
OK, see ya later. Bye.

2277
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,330
Oh, oh, oh, no.

2278
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:03,464
He's been touched on the island.

2279
01:27:03,464 --> 01:27:05,931
We want to be here. Hey,

2280
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:10,598
where are you, mister?

2281
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:11,498
Hello.

2282
01:27:11,882 --> 01:27:14,232
I smuggled a wrench to your cell.

2283
01:27:14,232 --> 01:27:16,249
Go to the cell now. My.

2284
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:18,466
Oh, we all.
We turn off the metal detector, right?

2285
01:27:18,783 --> 01:27:21,166
Oh, shit. I got scared.

2286
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,133
You scared me very sick in there. Well,

2287
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:28,484
uh, I have to go with you.

2288
01:27:28,684 --> 01:27:30,818
I think I have to go with you. I think so.

2289
01:27:31,951 --> 01:27:34,002
I don't know.

2290
01:27:34,568 --> 01:27:36,369
Oh, let's go to. I don't know.

2291
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:38,102
Hold on.
Let me look around here for a second.

2292
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:39,669
Yeah, let's look around.

2293
01:27:39,736 --> 01:27:43,503
Go. There's not really anything to do
here.

2294
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,804
E e why would we need
to turn off the metal detector?

2295
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,787
If you're going to give me the wrench?

2296
01:27:49,787 --> 01:27:50,437
Doesn't make any sense.

2297
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:53,221
Yeah, I don't understand either. Way.

2298
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:56,838
So in here, there's this guard.

2299
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,572
Is he chill his children?

2300
01:27:58,572 --> 01:27:59,889
Oh, wait.

2301
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:00,905
Get on the inside.

2302
01:28:00,905 --> 01:28:01,906
Oh, you.

2303
01:28:01,906 --> 01:28:05,106
Go in I give you a wrench, and
I go in. He's going to give me a patch.

2304
01:28:05,123 --> 01:28:07,156
A bomb that's going to be air.

2305
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:09,107
Just let me touch you up for a little bit.
Yeah. Fuck.

2306
01:28:09,107 --> 01:28:11,290
Why do I have to be the one to get
touched? You know the drill.

2307
01:28:12,307 --> 01:28:13,574
You like being touched.

2308
01:28:13,574 --> 01:28:15,541
Oh, all right.

2309
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,858
There you go. OK, now you take this.

2310
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:19,825
Get on the other side and help me, ok?

2311
01:28:19,825 --> 01:28:22,125
I get all of a sudden.

2312
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:23,142
Help me

2313
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:27,126
you can give it to me.

2314
01:28:27,126 --> 01:28:27,609
He's worse.

2315
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:28,626
A motherfucker.

2316
01:28:28,626 --> 01:28:30,793
E Oh,

2317
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:32,593
my God.

2318
01:28:32,593 --> 01:28:35,044
I pressed it already.

2319
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:38,194
You dumb ass.

2320
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:40,411
All right, now I come first.

2321
01:28:40,411 --> 01:28:42,728
Oh, all right. Oh, oh.

2322
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:44,078
Then I forgot.

2323
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:46,295
Hey, I think I hooked up. Cool.

2324
01:28:46,295 --> 01:28:48,012
We're good now.

2325
01:28:48,012 --> 01:28:49,712
What are we going to do now?

2326
01:28:49,712 --> 01:28:51,796
Oh, yeah.

2327
01:28:52,963 --> 01:28:54,213
We talk to him.

2328
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:55,713
Oh, he's falling asleep.

2329
01:28:55,713 --> 01:28:56,180
He's.

2330
01:28:57,397 --> 01:28:59,414
He's falling asleep on the job.

2331
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:00,130
Yeah.

2332
01:29:00,364 --> 01:29:02,431
Well, he doesn't have to do much.

2333
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:05,498
Dozens on work in front of him
with my ass.

2334
01:29:06,248 --> 01:29:08,832
What if we just kiss in
front of him right now?

2335
01:29:08,832 --> 01:29:09,315
Look,

2336
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:14,166

2337
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:16,516
Oh, oh, oh,

01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,350
oh, oh, oh.

2339
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,083
All right.

2340
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:21,767
All right.

2341
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:23,950
Oh, oh, wait.

2342
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,384
Oh, hello.

2343
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:27,884
Boys. My name's.

01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:28,751

Thank you. What's going on?

2349
01:29:36,785 --> 01:29:37,802
I like that voice you did.

2350
01:29:37,802 --> 01:29:40,153
Was that like you're.
It was that young, the stuff.

2351
01:29:40,153 --> 01:29:41,286
Don't you feel like you're a kid?

2352
01:29:41,286 --> 01:29:43,003
Yeah, I'm downstairs.

2353
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,237
I sound like a little kid.

2354
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:45,337
Now just go.

2355
01:29:45,337 --> 01:29:47,504

Hey, guys, maybe

shake down this one inside, ok?

2365
01:30:08,557 --> 01:30:11,057
Never mind. Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.

2373
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:26,176
There's got to be a better place.
To hide it.

2374
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,276
I put in your butt and your butt.

2375
01:30:28,276 --> 01:30:30,193
They never check. Their hind here
behind her like.

2376
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:32,210
Oh, that's true. Yeah, you're right.

Cool. OK.

01:30:42,961 --> 01:30:45,062
You look so smug.

2380
01:30:46,862 --> 01:30:48,912
All right, arms up.

2381
01:30:49,062 --> 01:30:49,662
Oh, my God.

2382
01:30:49,662 --> 01:30:52,363
Tiptoes to assert dominance.

2383
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:54,430
Nice bars, sir.

2384
01:30:54,946 --> 01:30:56,797
Against the bars.

2385
01:30:58,147 --> 01:30:59,830
All right, all right. Hey.

2386
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:02,714
Easy, easy game, dude.

2387
01:31:02,714 --> 01:31:05,115
So now we have to rent so we can.

2388
01:31:05,531 --> 01:31:07,965
Uh. What are we. Doing with the ranch,
though?

2389
01:31:07,965 --> 01:31:10,499
Probably kill each other with a bucket.

2390
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,432
Oh, well, you have a wife.

2391
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:16,033

I was like.

2395
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,250
This is a present thing, OK?

2396
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,251
Like, oh, well, obviously
prison stays in prison.

2397
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:25,684
All right, ok. OK.

2398
01:31:25,684 --> 01:31:26,317

01:31:31,568 --> 01:31:33,752
Say, that was nothing.
Yeah, you come in here.

2402
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:36,736
I have ruined our. Family, man.

2403
01:31:36,886 --> 01:31:38,986
Is that we don't have a family.

2404
01:31:39,186 --> 01:31:39,936
It seems. Like we.

2405
01:31:39,936 --> 01:31:42,603
Were imagining all of this. Are you sure?

2406
01:31:43,153 --> 01:31:44,803
I have a wife and five kids.

2407
01:31:44,803 --> 01:31:46,387
You call me crazy.

2408
01:31:46,387 --> 01:31:47,854
Stop coming on to me.

2409
01:31:47,854 --> 01:31:50,104
I've never given you advances.

2410
01:31:50,321 --> 01:31:52,171
It's only your head.

2411
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:54,371
Your so too.

2412
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:55,755
I don't know yet.

2413
01:31:55,755 --> 01:31:56,655
Kim, my vein.

2414
01:31:56,655 --> 01:31:58,922
Holy shit.
I can't stop looking at the beam bulge

2415
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:01,622
oh, my God.

2416
01:32:01,622 --> 01:32:03,673
Like it's like a snickers. You know, the.

2417
01:32:04,456 --> 01:32:07,507
That's not he misses it.

2418
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:09,524
You know, I think there's a.
Little getting rid of that. Yeah.

2419
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,374
So I saw an article saying that
they're going to get rid of the dick vein.

2420
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:13,141
Yeah.

2421
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:16,808
Someone donated to me yesterday
and said to a a suicide.

2422
01:32:16,808 --> 01:32:19,725
I think they're having an emotional
moment, and we're talking about big veins.

2423
01:32:19,892 --> 01:32:21,392
All right.

2424
01:32:24,992 --> 01:32:27,309
Uh. Don't worry about that.

2425
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:30,526
You won't? Fine. And you're sure?

2426
01:32:30,526 --> 01:32:32,743
Yeah. I got us a new place Bishop.

2427
01:32:32,743 --> 01:32:35,294
Oh, for now. Woo! I got a new house.

2428
01:32:35,977 --> 01:32:38,411
Nice. Baby, baby, listen.

2429
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:39,494
Baby, baby, you.

2430
01:32:39,494 --> 01:32:40,628
Have to. Stay first.

2431
01:32:40,628 --> 01:32:41,561
Why are you still waiting?

2432
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:44,612
I'm just watching.
No, I have no big cheese.

2433
01:32:44,612 --> 01:32:46,712
No, I have no meetings.

2434
01:32:46,712 --> 01:32:48,596
No visitors are coming in.

2435
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:50,246
No one came to visit me.

2436
01:32:50,246 --> 01:32:52,363
Don't call all go back. To yourself.

2437
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:53,896
That's so sad.

2438
01:32:53,896 --> 01:32:56,147
Actually,
I'd like to make a phone call, sir.

2439
01:32:56,597 --> 01:32:58,297
Let's go play

2440
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,731
Osama drama wife.

2441
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:03,548
I don't know yeah. Pregnant, Carol.

2442
01:33:04,365 --> 01:33:05,348
Pregnant.

2443
01:33:05,348 --> 01:33:06,398
Oh, I have a wife.

2444
01:33:06,398 --> 01:33:08,282
At home expecting our baby.

2445
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:09,165
Oh, my. Sister.

2446
01:33:09,165 --> 01:33:10,315
Did you call her my sister?

2447
01:33:10,315 --> 01:33:12,482
Did you want.

2448
01:33:13,599 --> 01:33:15,916
My say at all? You're in prison.

2449
01:33:16,116 --> 01:33:17,316
I'm going to be out.

2450
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,733
Your sister can be pregnant.

2451
01:33:18,733 --> 01:33:21,017
And this isn't who you are.

2452
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:23,401
Is this how you want your future child
to remember you?

2453
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:27,401
But I need to take care of the Harvey
situation.

2454
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:29,401
Oh, my God, Carol.

2455
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:31,535
You know that he killed Gary.

2456
01:33:31,535 --> 01:33:33,969
He was my family, my own brother.

2457
01:33:34,352 --> 01:33:36,219
I got revenge on you.

2458
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:37,803
But you can't bring him back.

2459
01:33:37,803 --> 01:33:39,136
You're just going to get yourself killed.

2460
01:33:39,136 --> 01:33:40,120
My wife is hot.

2461
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,303
Police you know I have to do this.

2462
01:33:43,353 --> 01:33:44,737
And she loves you, Vincent.

2463
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,504
Well.

2464
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:50,171
I'm not really into. Looks like.

2465
01:33:50,171 --> 01:33:53,588
Well, after that, I don't know.

2466
01:33:54,855 --> 01:33:56,288
What are you going to say?

2467
01:33:56,288 --> 01:33:57,422
Or are you going to say?

2468
01:33:57,422 --> 01:34:00,822
I'm not really into people who are, like,

2469
01:34:00,822 --> 01:34:03,856
creating spawn points
inside their fucking stomach.

2470
01:34:03,856 --> 01:34:04,456
Right?

2471
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:07,623
I'm not really into that.

2472
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:08,373
You don't.

2473
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:12,941
I? I don't think they can huh?

2474
01:34:14,474 --> 01:34:17,075
I'm not into pregnant people, bro.

2475
01:34:17,341 --> 01:34:18,125
That's.

2476
01:34:18,192 --> 01:34:19,542
That's beside the point.

2477
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:21,875
But not looking at the pregnant. Oh,
my God.

2478
01:34:22,325 --> 01:34:23,676
Our window will leave tonight.

2479
01:34:23,676 --> 01:34:26,543
You're acting like you're acting
like we're saying pregnant.

2480
01:34:26,543 --> 01:34:32,077
The pregnant people are a type
that people are what the.

2481
01:34:32,444 --> 01:34:35,144
Shut up, shut up and just be quiet.

2482
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:35,827
Just stop.

2483
01:34:35,827 --> 01:34:36,494
Just stop.

2484
01:34:36,494 --> 01:34:38,011
I can't do this anymore. I'm pretty.

2485
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:39,795
Sure that's like a category.

2486
01:34:39,795 --> 01:34:43,028
I if that's a category
I don't want anything to do with it.

2487
01:34:46,445 --> 01:34:48,562
Yes, this thing is not.

2488
01:34:48,579 --> 01:34:50,613
Anyways, cause we're both married men.

2489
01:34:50,829 --> 01:34:51,513
We know.

2490
01:34:51,513 --> 01:34:53,296
We both cheated on our wives.

2491
01:34:53,296 --> 01:34:55,930
In prison. Each other yeah. Yep. Uh huh.

2492
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,014
Uh huh.

2493
01:34:57,014 --> 01:34:57,364
Uh huh.

2494
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:59,797
Uh huh. Oh,
and now we're just going to start shovel.

2495
01:35:00,281 --> 01:35:01,781
Yeah, just don't drop it.

2496
01:35:01,781 --> 01:35:03,515
OK, so a lot of sexual tension here.

2497
01:35:03,515 --> 01:35:05,431
Yeah, we do. Have this. Engine.

2498
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:07,298
Let's hope we don't have to.

2499
01:35:07,298 --> 01:35:08,715
There's nothing to hope for.

2500
01:35:08,715 --> 01:35:10,249
It ain't happened.

2501
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:11,532
And it over.

2502
01:35:11,532 --> 01:35:13,449
Yeah. Give me the wrench.

2503
01:35:14,316 --> 01:35:17,617
Oh. Oh, boy.

2504
01:35:17,617 --> 01:35:18,933
What are we doing?

2505
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:21,034
I don't do both these and a new one.

2506
01:35:21,034 --> 01:35:22,417
Do both those.

2507
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:24,934
These you go.

2508
01:35:24,934 --> 01:35:25,301
Thank you.

2509
01:35:25,301 --> 01:35:25,901
Might

2510
01:35:27,851 --> 01:35:28,985
fuck it up.

2511
01:35:29,318 --> 01:35:31,718
What do you mean, don't fuck it up?

2512
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:33,402
What I heard the noise.

2513
01:35:33,402 --> 01:35:34,686
I guess. I did.

2514
01:35:34,686 --> 01:35:35,169
Yeah.

2515
01:35:35,252 --> 01:35:37,419
The blooming,
the fucking boom in the background.

2516
01:35:37,419 --> 01:35:39,970
I mean, I fucked it up. Boom, boom.

2517
01:35:41,537 --> 01:35:43,937
OK. What

2518
01:35:45,737 --> 01:35:48,604
I. Up we go.

2519
01:35:48,971 --> 01:35:50,204
I thought this is it.

2520
01:35:50,204 --> 01:35:52,538
Really good escape now.

2521
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:55,872
Huh? Huh?

2522
01:35:55,872 --> 01:35:56,522
Is this actually.

2523
01:35:56,522 --> 01:35:57,255
Escape?

2524
01:35:59,122 --> 01:35:59,922
My fat lady?

2525
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:01,056
So we just run.

2526
01:36:01,056 --> 01:36:02,423
Let's go. See? See what?

2527
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:02,923
Pull up.

2528
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,473
Oh, my God, you bitch. You go in.

2529
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:06,373
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.

2530
01:36:06,373 --> 01:36:07,690
That's a yellow up that we can pull up.

2531
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:09,657
But it was like this way. Mm hmm.

2532
01:36:09,657 --> 01:36:09,974
Hmm, hmm.

2533
01:36:09,974 --> 01:36:11,041
I'm following. I'm following.

2534
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,141
I'm on your ass somewhere else.

2535
01:36:13,391 --> 01:36:14,341
Thank goodness.

2536
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:15,608
You you do.

2537
01:36:15,608 --> 01:36:17,175
You smart, you smart.

2538
01:36:17,175 --> 01:36:19,358
Little cookie.
You are a smart little cookie.

2539
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:20,375
I like fucking you probably.

2540
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,992
You probably got all the gold stars
in pre-school.

2541
01:36:22,992 --> 01:36:23,742
Probably.

2542
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:25,209
Yeah. I didn't get any love as a kid.

2543
01:36:25,209 --> 01:36:27,760
Let's go. Woosh.

2544
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,927
And, yeah, I'm going in.

2545
01:36:29,927 --> 01:36:30,877
It looks like you're hugging me.

2546
01:36:32,227 --> 01:36:34,444
You're hugging me from behind

2547
01:36:36,278 --> 01:36:38,361
oh. OK, officer.

2548
01:36:39,345 --> 01:36:41,345
Enough of. That noise. OK.

2549
01:36:42,045 --> 01:36:45,012
Let me go in the

2550
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:46,246
back. Had to open the door for you.

2551
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:48,513
Hold on. No. Oh.

2552
01:36:49,713 --> 01:36:51,813
I just jumped on it.
Jump on through, then.

2553
01:36:51,813 --> 01:36:54,247
I guess. A jump scared you.

2554
01:36:54,247 --> 01:36:55,564
Not really.

2555
01:36:56,264 --> 01:36:58,831
What the fuck was that noise?

2556
01:36:59,464 --> 01:37:00,848
Today? No, wait.

2557
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,515
There's guards. There's guards,
there's guards, there's guards.

2558
01:37:03,515 --> 01:37:06,248
You have a lot of they guarding nothing.

2559
01:37:06,248 --> 01:37:08,082
What are the chances.

2560
01:37:08,082 --> 01:37:11,799
That I had which

2561
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:17,017
who took you to?

2562
01:37:17,017 --> 01:37:19,117
Toot, toot, toot,
toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot.

2563
01:37:19,117 --> 01:37:20,434
You're so. Careless.

2564
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:23,017
You are so careless.

2565
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:24,068
How do they not see you?

2566
01:37:24,068 --> 01:37:26,085
Tell us they're not looking this way.

2567
01:37:26,851 --> 01:37:27,585
That's why.

2568
01:37:27,585 --> 01:37:30,135
Let go. OK, ok,

2569
01:37:30,135 --> 01:37:31,085
I shit.

2570
01:37:31,202 --> 01:37:32,952
Excuse guard you're a scaredy cat.

2571
01:37:32,952 --> 01:37:36,053
I thought it was be a dog. We want to go.

2572
01:37:36,069 --> 01:37:38,020
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2573
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:44,320
Me all that's more. OK.

2574
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,971
I like that.

2575
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,921
Oh. Meza.

2576
01:37:51,105 --> 01:37:51,705
Oh, shit.

2577
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:54,522
The thunder. I don't know.

2578
01:37:54,872 --> 01:37:56,322
Oh, my God.

2579
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:59,739
Oh, which way

2580
01:38:00,106 --> 01:38:03,273
on your side?

2581
01:38:03,606 --> 01:38:06,207
No, no, not like that.

2582
01:38:06,207 --> 01:38:09,041
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

2583
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:11,924
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2584
01:38:11,924 --> 01:38:13,091
Oh, shit.

2585
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:15,041
Oh, my. God.

2586
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:15,575
We're on time.

2587
01:38:15,575 --> 01:38:17,408
That time,
the ac that you see that we can.

2588
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:19,875
We can be more in sync.

2589
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:21,076
You're in sync.

2590
01:38:21,492 --> 01:38:23,326
We have that synergy, see?

2591
01:38:23,326 --> 01:38:25,276
How are we going to play legal legends

2592
01:38:25,276 --> 01:38:27,460
with each other
if we don't have that synergy?

2593
01:38:27,643 --> 01:38:28,627
I replied to. You.

2594
01:38:28,627 --> 01:38:31,127
I was like, add me,
and then you didn't add me.

2595
01:38:31,127 --> 01:38:33,911
Oh, you did. See that? No, I did. Yeah.

2596
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:35,311
Oh, you did. Oh, shit.

2597
01:38:35,311 --> 01:38:36,128
I didn't see it.

2598
01:38:36,128 --> 01:38:38,745
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2599
01:38:38,745 --> 01:38:39,761
It's not. I'm not trust.

2600
01:38:39,761 --> 01:38:41,495
Oh, no, no, no. No, no. I get it.

2601
01:38:41,495 --> 01:38:43,695
I know. I want to play.
I will play league with me.

2602
01:38:43,712 --> 01:38:45,796
Oh, hopefully
we get to talk about this later.

2603
01:38:45,796 --> 01:38:47,379
We're trying to break out of prison bitch

2604
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:50,413
now. Oh,
and you think this is more important?

2605
01:38:50,413 --> 01:38:52,097
OK, yeah.
I see what your priorities are. Yeah.

2606
01:38:52,097 --> 01:38:53,597
Yeah, that's right.

2607
01:38:53,597 --> 01:38:55,697
Time know priorities are.

2608
01:38:55,697 --> 01:38:56,530
Oh, my God. Yes.

2609
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:59,581
Take them down. I see

2610
01:38:59,881 --> 01:39:01,231
I got help. You want help?

2611
01:39:01,231 --> 01:39:02,131
You all know, you just.

2612
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:02,948
You killed him.

2613
01:39:02,948 --> 01:39:03,965
He's dead.

2614
01:39:05,915 --> 01:39:09,132
You like that from over

2615
01:39:11,283 --> 01:39:13,383
while. OK.

2616
01:39:13,383 --> 01:39:14,716
Now this. We're killing people.

2617
01:39:14,716 --> 01:39:16,717
Now there's no going back to his office.

2618
01:39:18,784 --> 01:39:19,517
I guess we just got.

2619
01:39:19,517 --> 01:39:22,901
Yeah, there's somebody at the top, though,
so we got to watch out for him.

2620
01:39:23,201 --> 01:39:25,535
You just teleport on my screen.

2621
01:39:25,535 --> 01:39:26,085
Oh, do.

2622
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:27,885
You remember when we were here
and I couldn't see the door?

2623
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:30,035
We were looking at each other
through the window. That's.

2624
01:39:30,035 --> 01:39:33,636
And you told me to go back to get them up
and then break it, and then you told.

2625
01:39:33,636 --> 01:39:35,686
Me to come back. Oh,
it's like we're going to do it again.

2626
01:39:35,686 --> 01:39:36,186
Look at this.

2627
01:39:36,186 --> 01:39:37,803
All good times.

2628
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:40,203
Good times.

2629
01:39:40,203 --> 01:39:41,887
Oh, maybe I can lift you up when I get up.

2630
01:39:41,887 --> 01:39:42,487
Mm hmm.

2631
01:39:43,037 --> 01:39:44,404
Yeah, yeah.

2632
01:39:44,404 --> 01:39:46,154
One bend over.

2633
01:39:46,154 --> 01:39:48,338
I got you. I got you bend over.

2634
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:50,205
Bend over. Wait.
How am I supposed to stop?

2635
01:39:51,305 --> 01:39:52,622
What are you doing, you idiot?

2636
01:39:52,622 --> 01:39:55,572
I'm trying to get out. How do I get out?

2637
01:39:55,572 --> 01:39:57,672
Each space

2638
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:01,090
maybe move back a little bit

2639
01:40:01,773 --> 01:40:02,406
but you.

2640
01:40:02,406 --> 01:40:04,607
You're, like, crouched over.

2641
01:40:04,607 --> 01:40:06,257
What? All I have to look at.

2642
01:40:06,257 --> 01:40:08,591
Oh, that's so dumb. Hey, you guy.

2643
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:10,924
Thank you. Hey, babe.

2644
01:40:10,924 --> 01:40:12,674
Thanks babe.

2645
01:40:13,025 --> 01:40:14,325
I saw your wife the other day.

2646
01:40:14,325 --> 01:40:17,025
What was that about that year? Yeah.

2647
01:40:17,025 --> 01:40:18,992
Are you looking at my wife?

2648
01:40:23,026 --> 01:40:23,743
I'm just.

2649
01:40:23,743 --> 01:40:25,793
I'm just. I just.
I want to know your type.

2650
01:40:25,793 --> 01:40:26,243
Maybe I can.

2651
01:40:26,243 --> 01:40:27,160
I could change for you.

2652
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,260
You know, you don't have to be over after.

2653
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,394
Could you grow up real quick?

2654
01:40:31,394 --> 01:40:34,628
Well, OK, let's cut out the kids.

2655
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:35,444
You that?

2656
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:37,995
I don't think so. Age.

2657
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:40,845
That's the one. Pleasure.

2658
01:40:40,845 --> 01:40:42,612
I know.

2659
01:40:42,612 --> 01:40:44,112
He said you wouldn't want to visit.

2660
01:40:44,112 --> 01:40:46,096
What's wrong with Asia? It's great.

2661
01:40:46,096 --> 01:40:47,946
You're so of the globe.

2662
01:40:47,946 --> 01:40:49,063
You look good to.

2663
01:40:49,063 --> 01:40:51,347
Stop. You English.

2664
01:40:52,097 --> 01:40:55,030
You're smart.
You are. You're, like, easily.

2665
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,431
You're easily distractable.

2670
01:41:06,699 --> 01:41:08,582

01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,383
The Pacific Ocean.

2673
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:15,700
What I wouldn't
give to be there right now.

01:41:17,084 --> 01:41:19,751
Sticking my hand up your ass just.

2675
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:20,801

01:41:34,036 --> 01:41:35,853
Are you looking at my boat? The yacht?

2682
01:41:35,853 --> 01:41:38,553
Although I was literally sticking
my whole fist on us.

2683
01:41:44,854 --> 01:41:45,788
You see that?

2684
01:41:45,788 --> 01:41:48,221

Why? What?

2694
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:11,524
Why am I walking through the window
like that fucking plane?

2695
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,742
Uh, it's probably an escape route, bruh.

I thought you were talking about, like, a
police officer holding a light out at us.

2765
01:44:48,663 --> 01:44:49,397
Shit.

2766
01:44:49,547 --> 01:44:50,147

Oh, gunshots.
Duck, duck, duck. Watch this.

2843
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:35,086
Ha ha ha.

2844
01:47:37,753 --> 01:47:38,504
Oh, my God.

2845
01:47:38,504 --> 01:47:40,304
Who is he? Who is he?

2846
01:47:40,304 --> 01:47:42,037
Who is he?

2847
01:47:44,504 --> 01:47:45,271
Look at that.

2848
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:47,805
Oh, my. Easy, easy fucking game.

2849
01:47:48,072 --> 01:47:50,739
Easy fucking game. I'm
going to kill this guy now.

2850
01:47:50,739 --> 01:47:53,056
Ok? OK.

2851
01:47:55,506 --> 01:47:56,823
Can I please.

2852
01:47:56,823 --> 01:47:57,256
I can.

2853
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:57,823
Wait.

2854
01:47:57,823 --> 01:48:00,623
I even get up here ok?

2855
01:48:01,357 --> 01:48:03,274
I got a good view of this.

2856
01:48:03,274 --> 01:48:04,157
Oh, yeah.

2857
01:48:04,157 --> 01:48:07,958
Look, I got one watch here so bad,

2858
01:48:08,741 --> 01:48:11,708
so I go I was.

2859
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:13,208
Do you hear this?

2860
01:48:13,542 --> 01:48:16,142
I'm clicking. I was clicking it. Oh, ok.

2861
01:48:16,142 --> 01:48:17,942
Then reset me. Think God.

2862
01:48:17,942 --> 01:48:18,826
All right, I want to.

2863
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:20,409
I want to get a view of this.

2864
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:21,726
You go kill him, OK?

2865
01:48:21,726 --> 01:48:23,143
All right, try again.

2866
01:48:23,143 --> 01:48:24,877
Camera angle.

2867
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:26,860
I think it's because I was crouching.

2868
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:28,411
Yeah, I'm still crouching.

2869
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:31,661
I get up there
it's like sniffing his butt.

2870
01:48:33,545 --> 01:48:35,145
Oh, Ow,

2871
01:48:35,145 --> 01:48:38,412
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2872
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:39,395
OK, push.

2873
01:48:39,395 --> 01:48:41,296
No, I want to push him off.

2874
01:48:41,296 --> 01:48:43,146
Yeah.

2875
01:48:43,346 --> 01:48:44,813
But outside.

2876
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:47,713
I turn off the lights still. Isn't that.

2877
01:48:47,713 --> 01:48:48,497
Isn't that.

2878
01:48:49,413 --> 01:48:52,564
Hey, babe,
you want to go and get your get your.

2879
01:48:52,814 --> 01:48:55,364
Wire we just need something to slide down.

2880
01:48:55,931 --> 01:48:57,615
Slide on this.

2881
01:48:57,815 --> 01:49:00,398
We need a coat hanger,

2882
01:49:00,548 --> 01:49:01,565
you know?

2883
01:49:01,682 --> 01:49:03,966
Yeah, there's there coat. Hangers on here.

2884
01:49:03,966 --> 01:49:06,733
That's convenient. OK.

2885
01:49:07,366 --> 01:49:09,483
When I saw this in, like, fucking family

2886
01:49:09,483 --> 01:49:10,983
guy or some shit.

2887
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,417
Fucking family guy.

2888
01:49:14,417 --> 01:49:16,484
Oh, maybe this was.

2889
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:18,101
Someone with box inside.

2890
01:49:18,101 --> 01:49:19,568
Oh, yeah, it's a buddy.

2891
01:49:19,568 --> 01:49:20,951
We was on Bart Simpson.

2892
01:49:20,951 --> 01:49:21,818
Family Guy.

2893
01:49:21,818 --> 01:49:23,318
Raoul

2894
01:49:24,818 --> 01:49:26,469
I can't slide down.

2895
01:49:26,469 --> 01:49:26,735
Yeah.

2896
01:49:26,735 --> 01:49:28,336
Oh, I can't wait for you.

2897
01:49:28,336 --> 01:49:31,119
It's not fun. I want to slide with you.

2898
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,886
I can't.

2899
01:49:32,886 --> 01:49:34,536
Oh, no, oh, no.

2900
01:49:34,536 --> 01:49:36,487
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

2901
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:39,487
Look. Oh, my God. Oh, oh,

2902
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:42,421
shit.

2903
01:49:42,971 --> 01:49:44,305
Oh, my God. They know. They know.

2904
01:49:44,305 --> 01:49:46,221
They know. They know.

2905
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:47,405
No, he's shooting you here.

2906
01:49:47,405 --> 01:49:50,472
Shooting you. Oh.

2907
01:49:50,472 --> 01:49:51,122
Come on, come on.

2908
01:49:51,122 --> 01:49:53,289
Keep holding, keep holding,
keep holding, keep holding. Oh.

2909
01:49:54,723 --> 01:49:56,206
I'm going to get shot, danger.

2910
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:58,607
I'm trying you.

2911
01:49:59,140 --> 01:49:59,540
Yeah.

2912
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:03,107
Well, he's had us so bad,
the aim is just terrible.

2913
01:50:04,324 --> 01:50:04,724
Oh, my.

2914
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:05,791
God. Oh,

2915
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:08,408
oh, my God.

2916
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:11,775
Oh, oh,

2917
01:50:11,892 --> 01:50:13,992
oh, oh.

2918
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:16,592
Guess.

2919
01:50:17,693 --> 01:50:18,826
Stop the bullets. Oh, yeah.

2920
01:50:18,826 --> 01:50:21,343
We dodged the bullet.

2921
01:50:21,343 --> 01:50:22,727
Dodged the bullet.

2922
01:50:23,777 --> 01:50:24,343
Yeah, they're actually.

2923
01:50:24,343 --> 01:50:25,477
They actually want to kill us.

2924
01:50:25,477 --> 01:50:26,344
No, it's good.

2925
01:50:26,344 --> 01:50:29,678
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2926
01:50:29,678 --> 01:50:30,811
Oh, no. This is bad.

2927
01:50:30,811 --> 01:50:32,261
Is bad, dude.

2928
01:50:35,262 --> 01:50:38,145
You sound like such a turkey.

2929
01:50:38,345 --> 01:50:40,512
Oh, boy.

2930
01:50:40,846 --> 01:50:41,896
Oh. Oh.

2931
01:50:41,896 --> 01:50:44,346
Oh, my God. Easy, easy game.

2932
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:45,313
Oh, my God.

2933
01:50:45,646 --> 01:50:47,763
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2934
01:50:47,763 --> 01:50:49,447
Easy fucking games.

2935
01:50:49,447 --> 01:50:49,697
Look, good.

2936
01:50:49,697 --> 01:50:52,564
That was first try. First try.

2937
01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:55,181
It was that. Easy to escape from prison?

2938
01:50:56,915 --> 01:50:57,365
Is that it?

2939
01:50:57,365 --> 01:50:59,115
Keep that in mind.

2940
01:50:59,532 --> 01:50:59,882
There's no way.

2941
01:50:59,882 --> 01:51:00,782
That's it.

2942
01:51:02,265 --> 01:51:05,049
And that's how we got into Fortnite
Battle Bus.

2943
01:51:06,249 --> 01:51:07,333
What's that?

2944
01:51:07,683 --> 01:51:10,683
OK, the truth I'm not quite sure.

2945
01:51:11,467 --> 01:51:11,950
You know.

2946
01:51:12,367 --> 01:51:13,867
You can make me choke on my water.

2947
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:15,001
What about it?

2948
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:19,151
Did you do that when you were a kid?

2949
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:19,868
Nope.

2950
01:51:20,285 --> 01:51:21,251
What do what?

2951
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:24,585
When I was a kid, I saw. It in
a comic book once when I was a kid.

2952
01:51:24,902 --> 01:51:26,552
Tell me your joke.

2953
01:51:26,552 --> 01:51:29,203
No, I'm just glad it worked.

2954
01:51:29,986 --> 01:51:31,653
Oh, my God.

2955
01:51:31,903 --> 01:51:33,753
I can't fucking believe
you talked me into it.

2956
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,437
How we get into a helicopter.

2957
01:51:35,437 --> 01:51:36,003
Me neither.

2958
01:51:36,003 --> 01:51:38,554
Or this is a helicopter right now.

2959
01:51:38,554 --> 01:51:40,154
It's a plane. A copter.

2960
01:51:40,154 --> 01:51:43,838
It has, like, wings
and the front, the one with the spinning.

2961
01:51:44,871 --> 01:51:48,139
I I want to choke you.

2962
01:51:48,305 --> 01:51:48,955
That.

2963
01:51:49,272 --> 01:51:50,355
That's fine.

2964
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:53,373
You like that kind of stuff? That chopper?

2965
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:53,706
Yeah.

2966
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:55,923
I prefer choking,
but we really piss them off.

2967
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,457
Oh, God.
They're losing everything they've got.

2968
01:51:58,457 --> 01:52:00,307
We have to be careful.

2969
01:52:01,207 --> 01:52:02,207
Yeah. Why am I following you?

2970
01:52:02,207 --> 01:52:04,591
Fine, Leo. Fine. Vincent.

2971
01:52:05,374 --> 01:52:06,841
What am I?

2972
01:52:06,841 --> 01:52:08,191
Larry, you're right here.

2973
01:52:08,191 --> 01:52:09,825
You're in front of me.

2974
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:13,059
Why what do you mean, fine?

2975
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:15,692
Leo, you're, like,
right in front of my face.

2976
01:52:16,509 --> 01:52:18,343
Hey, what if I hide in here?

2977
01:52:18,343 --> 01:52:20,743
Oh, no, I don't think you are. Oh, shit.

2978
01:52:21,827 --> 01:52:23,944
I don't care. Right. And here.

2979
01:52:23,944 --> 01:52:24,544
You go.

2980
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,394
This is for it.

2981
01:52:25,394 --> 01:52:26,294
Now, you what

2982
01:52:28,661 --> 01:52:29,411
yeah.

2983
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:32,711
We're in the new seise the fort. Like,

2984
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:33,612
let's go.

2985
01:52:33,845 --> 01:52:35,829
E Oh.

2986
01:52:35,829 --> 01:52:37,112
I'm just going to sit here.

2987
01:52:37,112 --> 01:52:39,946
Hey, why clapping on me, bro? To send me.

2988
01:52:40,112 --> 01:52:41,596
You offered.

2989
01:52:41,596 --> 01:52:42,263
I was just.

2990
01:52:42,263 --> 01:52:44,563
You offered. Get your butt. Off here now.

2991
01:52:45,163 --> 01:52:45,513
Thank you.

2992
01:52:48,814 --> 01:52:50,464
What happened to my floral shirt and this?

2993
01:52:50,464 --> 01:52:52,414
That there are cops everywhere.

2994
01:52:52,414 --> 01:52:54,765
Uh. Yeah.

2995
01:52:54,765 --> 01:52:57,515
The game realised it wasn't drip come on.

2996
01:52:57,515 --> 01:52:59,565
I had more drip than you.

2997
01:52:59,915 --> 01:53:01,715
So much more.

2998
01:53:01,982 --> 01:53:04,449
Spit on the from more drip.

2999
01:53:05,433 --> 01:53:06,249
I don't think so.

3000
01:53:06,249 --> 01:53:07,666
Yes, of course.

3001
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:10,217
That would better than we kill him.

3002
01:53:10,217 --> 01:53:13,567
They don't see us in the bushes
because that dumb

3003
01:53:13,567 --> 01:53:15,184
I will kill them right now.

3004
01:53:15,184 --> 01:53:17,384
OK? OK, Assassin's Creed II fucking.

3005
01:53:18,551 --> 01:53:21,668
I'm glad we get this guy.

3006
01:53:22,685 --> 01:53:24,335
Oh, this is fucking easy.

3007
01:53:24,335 --> 01:53:26,552
Easy way. How does he not see me?

3008
01:53:27,069 --> 01:53:29,586
How does he not see me?

3009
01:53:30,486 --> 01:53:32,620
Took to the streets.

3010
01:53:32,803 --> 01:53:34,237
Oh, shit.

3011
01:53:34,387 --> 01:53:36,287
We. Oh, my God.

3012
01:53:36,287 --> 01:53:38,137
His arm

3013
01:53:39,121 --> 01:53:40,021
dude.

3014
01:53:41,054 --> 01:53:41,971
Fuck that kid.

3015
01:53:41,971 --> 01:53:42,821
He died.

3016
01:53:44,138 --> 01:53:45,072
Do you miss this offer?

3017
01:53:45,072 --> 01:53:46,422
Blood right now?

3018
01:53:46,422 --> 01:53:47,138
I am.

3019
01:53:47,522 --> 01:53:49,305
I just only. I got one. Yeah, away from.

3020
01:53:49,305 --> 01:53:50,506
I love the taste of blood.

3021
01:53:50,506 --> 01:53:52,506
However we have to do another.

3022
01:53:52,506 --> 01:53:54,123

01:55:16,084 --> 01:55:18,135
Well, if I say Johnson. He could do man.

3063
01:55:18,751 --> 01:55:20,918
He could do it back up from the sheriff.

3064
01:55:20,918 --> 01:55:22,802
Well, all right,

3065
01:55:24,852 --> 01:55:28,269

01:55:30,636 --> 01:55:31,236
No, you.

3069
01:55:31,236 --> 01:55:34,187
Because you shot down.

3070
01:55:34,637 --> 01:55:36,004
He hit me on the head.

3071
01:55:36,004 --> 01:55:37,721
Hands above your head.

3072
01:55:37,721 --> 01:55:39,521
Oh, my God. Straight up.

3073
01:55:39,521 --> 01:55:42,538
Thinks me deserves a name.

3074
01:55:42,571 --> 01:55:45,255
Here, here. Man.

3075
01:55:45,255 --> 01:55:46,239
I'm running.

3076
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:48,539
And I'm gonna kill over there.

3077
01:55:48,789 --> 01:55:50,973
This one's mine.
You can't have this kind of spying.

3078
01:55:51,006 --> 01:55:52,806
No, it's mine. It's mine.

3079
01:55:52,806 --> 01:55:54,423
Why are you so much faster than me?

3080
01:55:54,423 --> 01:55:56,673
Why are you so much smarter than me?
Fuck all.

3081
01:55:56,973 --> 01:55:57,557
You're a bitch.

3082
01:55:57,557 --> 01:55:58,274
I'm going to agree with you.

3083
01:55:58,274 --> 01:56:00,557
I'm going to go and get caught right now.

3084
01:56:00,557 --> 01:56:03,074
Oh, yes. Coming right now? Yes.

3085
01:56:03,074 --> 01:56:04,608

01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:09,192
Wait.

3089
01:56:09,225 --> 01:56:11,859
I don't think we're supposed to go
this way.

3090
01:56:12,192 --> 01:56:13,142
I'm not going to.

3091
01:56:13,142 --> 01:56:14,559
Yeah, we're not supposed to go this way.

3092

01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:19,293
Yeah, I know.

3094
01:56:19,293 --> 01:56:21,427
You're looking at it every 40 seconds.

3095
01:56:21,843 --> 01:56:23,644
Oh, you can see my screen. Yes.

3096
01:56:23,644 --> 01:56:24,494
Thank you. Yeah.

3097
01:56:24,494 --> 01:56:26,194
This entire time I could see your skin.

3098
01:56:26,194 --> 01:56:27,794
What are you talking about?

3099
01:56:27,794 --> 01:56:30,645

I did not actually mean to go down

01:58:28,061 --> 01:58:30,045
I'm going to run. OK,
I could do it again. All right.

3149
01:58:30,045 --> 01:58:32,045
Three, two, one.

3150
01:58:33,729 --> 01:58:35,612
Michael, is that easy?

3151
01:58:35,612 --> 01:58:39,313
It's that easy. Ba Oh.

3153
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:41,596
Hold on.

Yeah, well, audible water.

3155
01:58:48,264 --> 01:58:48,714

Yeah, sure.

3160
01:59:02,449 --> 01:59:04,333
Sound like you're in something there.

3161
01:59:04,333 --> 01:59:06,733
OK, cool.

3162
01:59:06,733 --> 01:59:08,317
I'm going to climb up here.

3163
01:59:08,317 --> 01:59:11,734
Oh, I need to give you a boost again
because it's so tiny.

3164
01:59:11,884 --> 01:59:13,451
Small, so small.

01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:15,484
My form is like, non.

3166
01:59:15,484 --> 01:59:16,501
Not even joking.

3167
01:59:16,501 --> 01:59:18,818
I'm so much bigger than you.

3168
01:59:18,818 --> 01:59:20,318
Oh, yeah? How tall are you?

3169
01:59:20,318 --> 01:59:22,602
Shove my balls in your face.

3170
01:59:22,602 --> 01:59:23,019
That's a lot.

3171
01:59:23,019 --> 01:59:25,636
Big speed limit is 35.

3172
01:59:26,086 --> 01:59:26,953
I know you got neutered.

3173
01:59:29,103 --> 01:59:30,337
That's not we.

3174
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:32,320
What is getting neutered, dammit.

3175
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,754
Oh, this is it, really.

3176
01:59:34,754 --> 01:59:36,021
Snip, snip.

3177
01:59:36,021 --> 01:59:37,304
Snip, snip under the bridge.

3178
01:59:37,304 --> 01:59:38,954
Oh, that's so size nipple.

3179
01:59:38,954 --> 01:59:39,638
It's way too high.

3180
01:59:39,638 --> 01:59:42,038
Yeah, but you can't come anymore.

3181
01:59:42,038 --> 01:59:44,255
But can, can you still bulk up?

3182
01:59:45,155 --> 01:59:46,472
Yes, of course.

3183
01:59:46,472 --> 01:59:47,139
But you just.

3184
01:59:47,139 --> 01:59:49,756
Can't nothing is produce.

3185
01:59:49,756 --> 01:59:51,823
You nuts, man. OK. Let's see.

3186
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,506
I don't know how he works.

3187
01:59:53,506 --> 01:59:56,173
Oh, wait. You under the bridge?

3188
01:59:56,857 --> 01:59:59,624
Are way we can choose?

3189
01:59:59,624 --> 02:00:00,607
Which one do we want to do?

3190
02:00:00,607 --> 02:00:02,441
I don't mind. Over under the bridge.

3191
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:04,475
Go over the bridge.

3192
02:00:04,875 --> 02:00:06,492
Do you want me a top or bottom base
itself?

3193
02:00:06,492 --> 02:00:06,875
Let's come.

3194
02:00:06,875 --> 02:00:09,092
Connelly sweetie, why is mine under?

3195
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:13,359
I I mean, makes sense.

3196
02:00:14,226 --> 02:00:17,593
You know, you're like, you know.

3197
02:00:17,593 --> 02:00:19,693
You are ballsy. You are so ballsy.

3198
02:00:20,644 --> 02:00:22,544
That's why I'm the top.

3199
02:00:22,544 --> 02:00:24,194
Telling you this is going to work.

3200
02:00:24,194 --> 02:00:25,561
Just jump in the back and stay.

3201
02:00:25,561 --> 02:00:26,861
Oh, my God.

3202
02:00:26,861 --> 02:00:29,278
I can't believe this is what we're doing
right now. What?

3203
02:00:29,295 --> 02:00:31,545
You're driving. You put up the police car

3204
02:00:32,595 --> 02:00:34,662
this is, like, so dumb.

3205
02:00:34,662 --> 02:00:37,046
What? We're going to get coverage.

3206
02:00:38,113 --> 02:00:40,330
I run him over. Run him over.

3207
02:00:40,713 --> 02:00:43,413
You think you want me.

3208
02:00:48,781 --> 02:00:51,165
You so stupid with your hat on?

3209
02:00:51,165 --> 02:00:54,065
Oh, my God. Why did he dive that way?

3210
02:00:54,432 --> 02:00:57,832
Even what it's like
in the way he was scared.

3211
02:00:58,632 --> 02:01:00,816
Anyone over there?

3212
02:01:00,816 --> 02:01:03,016
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

3213
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:04,866
Oh, no, miss that we. Fucked up
we walked out.

3214
02:01:04,866 --> 02:01:05,767
Holy shit.

3215
02:01:05,767 --> 02:01:06,700
Holy shit.

3216
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,767
Where are we going? What?

3217
02:01:09,767 --> 02:01:10,451
We're going.

3218
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:12,367
And don't worry.

3219
02:01:12,518 --> 02:01:15,151
You're going on a trip and out there.

3220
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:17,552
Good shit. Oh.

3221
02:01:22,752 --> 02:01:25,603
All according to plan.

3222
02:01:25,603 --> 02:01:27,336
This is your fault.

3223
02:01:27,603 --> 02:01:29,587
Your fucking fault. I'm a detective.

3224
02:01:29,587 --> 02:01:32,087
I finds the best ways out.

3225
02:01:32,087 --> 02:01:34,421
Look at that. See that?

3226
02:01:34,837 --> 02:01:37,504
No, it's fine, but oh, my God.

3227
02:01:37,688 --> 02:01:39,788
Thank you, dogs. That's also coming.
The dogs are coming.

3228
02:01:39,971 --> 02:01:41,522
The dogs are coming.

3229
02:01:43,622 --> 02:01:44,439
You're not with me.

3230
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:45,455
Where are you?

3231
02:01:46,472 --> 02:01:48,106
I'm just running. I'm just running.

3232
02:01:48,106 --> 02:01:51,173
Stuffing ducks.
How are we alive after that?

3233
02:01:51,556 --> 02:01:53,790
They're on the slow.

3234
02:01:54,257 --> 02:01:55,324
Oh, my God.

3235
02:01:56,857 --> 02:02:00,424
Oh. Oh, come on, do something.

3236
02:02:00,424 --> 02:02:02,108
Describe the dogs.

3237
02:02:02,341 --> 02:02:04,058
Now. Let's stop.

3238
02:02:04,058 --> 02:02:07,025
Oh, oh, get off.

3239
02:02:07,842 --> 02:02:09,876
You know, I'm showing.

3240
02:02:10,726 --> 02:02:13,776
Who killed you.

3241
02:02:14,176 --> 02:02:15,526
Why are you running?

3242
02:02:15,526 --> 02:02:16,777
He fucking kill you.

3243
02:02:16,777 --> 02:02:21,911
There was a shit.

3244
02:02:23,494 --> 02:02:25,028
Just Matt. Just spell it.

3245
02:02:25,028 --> 02:02:26,261
Just spam it easy.

3246
02:02:26,261 --> 02:02:27,695
I kicked out.

3247
02:02:29,445 --> 02:02:30,462
I'll catch you.

3248
02:02:30,462 --> 02:02:31,545
Oh, God.

3249
02:02:31,545 --> 02:02:33,012
Yeah, I'll catch you. I'll catch you.

3250
02:02:33,012 --> 02:02:33,696
I promise.

3251
02:02:33,696 --> 02:02:35,796
Oh. This is a very nice trip.

3252
02:02:35,796 --> 02:02:37,746
Yeah. We got to get out of here. Oh.

3253
02:02:39,513 --> 02:02:42,197
Oh, wait and watch.

3254
02:02:42,763 --> 02:02:44,397
Catch me, baby.

3255
02:02:44,397 --> 02:02:46,214
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

3256
02:02:46,214 --> 02:02:49,331
That's me, baby. That's.

3257
02:02:49,331 --> 02:02:50,581
Holy shit.

3258
02:02:50,581 --> 02:02:53,198
You look like you slid off and fell.

3259
02:02:53,882 --> 02:02:54,582
Really?

3260
02:02:54,582 --> 02:02:55,532
Yeah.

3261
02:02:55,532 --> 02:02:59,132
And that was, like, the slowest slide
ever.

3262
02:02:59,132 --> 02:03:01,383
Shit. Dammit.

3263
02:03:01,383 --> 02:03:02,116
Almost.

3264
02:03:02,316 --> 02:03:04,367
Holy shit.

3265
02:03:04,667 --> 02:03:06,967
Well, if I didn't catch you there, dammit.

3266
02:03:08,567 --> 02:03:10,651
And I would have died.

3267
02:03:11,701 --> 02:03:14,401
But maybe I wanted to see that.

3268
02:03:14,535 --> 02:03:15,001
Oh, yeah.

3269
02:03:15,001 --> 02:03:16,868
I'll keep that in mind. OK?

3270
02:03:16,868 --> 02:03:18,435
I mean, I didn't do it, though.

3271
02:03:18,435 --> 02:03:19,352
I didn't follow through.

3272
02:03:19,352 --> 02:03:22,002
I could have the thoughts about it, but
I didn't follow through with it, you know?

3273
02:03:22,036 --> 02:03:24,069
Huh, uh huh.

3274
02:03:24,336 --> 02:03:25,870
Like, wow.

3275
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:27,353
Hey, man, I.

3276
02:03:27,436 --> 02:03:29,770
Just tell him this is the deal.

3277
02:03:29,770 --> 02:03:32,287
This is part of the mind.
Oh, no, I got it.

3278
02:03:32,654 --> 02:03:35,404
It's Harvey Dent into notice.

3279
02:03:35,421 --> 02:03:37,054
Did he go down? She grabbed my

3280
02:03:38,105 --> 02:03:38,655
hand, and.

3281
02:03:39,005 --> 02:03:40,688
I like his hair.

3282
02:03:40,805 --> 02:03:41,655
It's like Jamma.

3283
02:03:41,655 --> 02:03:43,655
He says, no, there's too much risk.

3284
02:03:44,972 --> 02:03:46,656
Well, it's not going to happen.

3285
02:03:46,656 --> 02:03:48,973
But listen,
I was not going to have Harvey.

3286
02:03:48,973 --> 02:03:51,006
I need to wait

3287
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:53,023
OK? Fucking Jeremiah.

3288
02:03:53,023 --> 02:03:53,440
This.

3289
02:03:56,274 --> 02:03:57,057
Look.

3290
02:03:57,174 --> 02:03:59,424
Take the deal or stop wasting my time.

3291
02:03:59,758 --> 02:04:00,608
All right?

3292
02:04:00,658 --> 02:04:03,758
Yeah. OK.

3293
02:04:03,758 --> 02:04:04,825
What's up?

3294
02:04:05,158 --> 02:04:07,442
Lee, you busted out of prison. What?

3295
02:04:07,442 --> 02:04:09,026
I just got the call.

3296
02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:10,226
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

3297
02:04:10,226 --> 02:04:12,926
A guy fucked
up, got himself killed by the guard's.

3298
02:04:12,926 --> 02:04:13,810
Good for nothing.

3299
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:14,943
Piece of shit.

3300
02:04:14,943 --> 02:04:15,960
Sorry. Boss.

3301
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:18,177
Look, Sean, we need to find him.

3302
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:19,944
I'll come tomorrow morning.

3303
02:04:19,944 --> 02:04:20,394
Who, me?

3304
02:04:20,394 --> 02:04:22,577
Why are you my name? Who, me? My problem.

3305
02:04:22,594 --> 02:04:23,428
Yeah, you.

3306
02:04:23,428 --> 02:04:25,044
I'm clearing my throat.

3307
02:04:25,044 --> 02:04:26,428
I don't give a fuck. How?

3308
02:04:26,428 --> 02:04:28,112
Just make it happen.

3309
02:04:28,112 --> 02:04:30,495
I need to clear my throat. All right. Yes.

3310
02:04:30,545 --> 02:04:32,229
So you decided I need us

3311
02:04:34,446 --> 02:04:37,129
OK? No deal.

3312
02:04:37,129 --> 02:04:39,446
Whoa! Oh, my God.

3313
02:04:39,446 --> 02:04:40,297
He has a gold gun.

3314
02:04:40,297 --> 02:04:40,947
Holy shit.

3315
02:04:40,947 --> 02:04:43,597
Oh, my God. Is this bougie

3316
02:04:44,047 --> 02:04:45,781
He's really wavy.

3317
02:04:46,314 --> 02:04:48,481
He had to complete all of the

3318
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:51,748
the skin challenges to get that.

3319
02:04:51,748 --> 02:04:53,765
Is this. Is this a Cisco reference?

3320
02:04:53,765 --> 02:04:54,932
I don't know.

3321
02:04:54,932 --> 02:04:57,416
I don't see or call anything.

3322
02:04:57,749 --> 02:04:59,466
I don't know. I don't play.

3323
02:04:59,466 --> 02:05:01,650
I don't play those games. Really?

3324
02:05:01,916 --> 02:05:04,467
Cisco I don't play it.

3325
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:05,934
What are you talking about?

3326
02:05:05,934 --> 02:05:06,834
I only play like.

3327
02:05:06,834 --> 02:05:09,317
Violence and.

3328
02:05:10,234 --> 02:05:10,851
It's.

3329
02:05:11,368 --> 02:05:13,651
Oh, my God.

3330
02:05:13,985 --> 02:05:16,135
It's Skyrim.

3331
02:05:16,285 --> 02:05:16,835
It's professional.

3332
02:05:16,835 --> 02:05:20,319
Wild damn dumb-ass. I'm hungry. Me too.

3333
02:05:20,402 --> 02:05:21,536
Was that DLC?

3334
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,769
I missed that shitty food.

3335
02:05:22,769 --> 02:05:25,503
We got to go over hungry.
I'll show you some food.

3336
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:26,553
But I definitely.

3337
02:05:26,553 --> 02:05:28,787
Yeah, I mean,
we probably can get. Some food anyway.

3338
02:05:29,003 --> 02:05:29,403
Let me.

3339
02:05:29,403 --> 02:05:31,504
I guess. Let me baby.
Something on the. Way.

3340
02:05:31,504 --> 02:05:32,337
I got some cake for

3341
02:05:33,371 --> 02:05:34,087
dessert.

3342
02:05:34,254 --> 02:05:34,954
I can't get them out.

3343
02:05:34,954 --> 02:05:36,955
Before we got the full meal right. Here.

3344
02:05:36,955 --> 02:05:38,971
I mean, look at it right now.

3345
02:05:38,971 --> 02:05:39,388
All right.

3346
02:05:39,388 --> 02:05:40,538
You do that.

3347
02:05:42,122 --> 02:05:43,539
This is actually really beautiful.

3348
02:05:43,539 --> 02:05:44,389
What the hell?

3349
02:05:44,389 --> 02:05:47,189
I, I thought we were going to be spending
most of our time in the prison.

3350
02:05:47,556 --> 02:05:48,690
This is odd.

3351
02:05:48,756 --> 02:05:51,573
I didn't think we were going to be outside

3352
02:05:52,723 --> 02:05:54,440
Why are we here?

3353
02:05:54,457 --> 02:05:55,590
Who am I?

3354
02:05:56,757 --> 02:05:57,774
Where are you?

3355
02:05:58,308 --> 02:06:01,108
Huh? Huh huh huh?

3356
02:06:01,858 --> 02:06:05,158
Oh, well, you teleporter.

3357
02:06:05,158 --> 02:06:06,359
Behind me.

3358
02:06:06,359 --> 02:06:09,009
On my will not let me show

3359
02:06:09,009 --> 02:06:09,776
you to.

3360
02:06:11,559 --> 02:06:13,410
Those incredible

3361
02:06:15,027 --> 02:06:16,143
phasing in and out.

3362
02:06:16,143 --> 02:06:17,260
I on the.

3363
02:06:17,844 --> 02:06:19,711
Simulator.

3364
02:06:21,027 --> 02:06:23,678
This is actually touching grass.

3365
02:06:24,061 --> 02:06:27,778
I think shy lily sent me that

3366
02:06:27,778 --> 02:06:28,378
I saw that.

3367
02:06:28,378 --> 02:06:29,795
Came on steam.

3368
02:06:29,795 --> 02:06:31,262
I don't know what that's about.

3369
02:06:31,262 --> 02:06:32,846
Why are you going to play it?

3370
02:06:34,046 --> 02:06:35,046
No, I'm going to play.

3371
02:06:35,046 --> 02:06:37,796
Touching grass
simulates a well, what I play that.

3372
02:06:38,563 --> 02:06:40,947
I'll. I think it might help.

3373
02:06:40,947 --> 02:06:43,164
Oh, I touched grass. A lot, actually.

3374
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:45,547
Yeah, I got a deal.

3375
02:06:45,547 --> 02:06:47,731
I try to touch grass
at least once a month.

3376
02:06:49,831 --> 02:06:50,581
As a streamer.

3377
02:06:50,581 --> 02:06:52,915
That's a lot. To be fair.

3378
02:06:52,915 --> 02:06:54,482
There's a camp down there.

3379
02:06:54,482 --> 02:06:55,982
My. You know, I'm proud of you.

3380
02:06:55,982 --> 02:06:58,749
Good job. At least you're touching grass.

3381
02:06:58,749 --> 02:07:00,866
Yeah, you're probably right.

3382
02:07:00,866 --> 02:07:03,833
At least you're touching grass
and not such a nice, you know?

3383
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:06,317
I mean,
you could probably touch your ass.

3384
02:07:06,317 --> 02:07:07,367
All right, all right.

3385
02:07:08,034 --> 02:07:10,618
Well, if your ass was full of grass,

3386
02:07:11,851 --> 02:07:13,535
then I would be. Touching my.

3387
02:07:13,535 --> 02:07:13,918
Own grass.

3388
02:07:13,918 --> 02:07:16,085
I'm gonna have more of that ass of a lawn
mower.

3389
02:07:16,585 --> 02:07:17,985
Right? Right.

3390
02:07:17,985 --> 02:07:20,452
Oh, my God. That's like, few times.

3391
02:07:20,469 --> 02:07:22,803
Final destination, death scene.

3392
02:07:22,803 --> 02:07:24,553
Jesus. My uncle actually.

3393
02:07:24,553 --> 02:07:26,286
Played in Splash last

3394
02:07:30,387 --> 02:07:31,354
got a.

3395
02:07:31,354 --> 02:07:33,421
Perfectly. Good I love what's hot.

3396
02:07:33,488 --> 02:07:35,821
Lol and getting your pants right
and in your pants. What

3397
02:07:37,371 --> 02:07:39,538
you stupid.

3398
02:07:39,722 --> 02:07:42,355
Why do we look so stupid.

3399
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:45,539
Oh, I look.

3400
02:07:45,539 --> 02:07:47,639
Like a Pokémon and.

3401
02:07:47,639 --> 02:07:48,806
I'm flying.

3402
02:07:48,806 --> 02:07:51,123
Cooking over anal you. Oh, God, it.

3403
02:07:51,923 --> 02:07:53,157
Mostly do you.

3404
02:07:53,157 --> 02:07:53,824
Say that?

3405
02:07:53,824 --> 02:07:55,057
Well, it's.

3406
02:07:55,057 --> 02:07:57,424
Well, let's shower with it.

3407
02:07:57,424 --> 02:07:59,641
I want to stick my head in your ass.

3408
02:07:59,641 --> 02:08:01,675
Oh, my back and like, give you a blowjob.

3409
02:08:01,675 --> 02:08:04,358
Oh, by the way, can you do it?

3410
02:08:04,358 --> 02:08:05,192
Do it again.

3411
02:08:06,375 --> 02:08:06,809
Well,

3412
02:08:10,176 --> 02:08:11,226
goddamn it.

3413
02:08:11,226 --> 02:08:13,376
Grab the fish.
I think we're supposed to grab fish.

3414
02:08:13,743 --> 02:08:16,043
Oh, right. Yeah. Go the other way. Go
the other way.

3415
02:08:16,043 --> 02:08:17,694
We're supposed to drop them, you know?

3416
02:08:17,694 --> 02:08:19,744
Oh, yeah.

3417
02:08:20,277 --> 02:08:23,528
Oh, pincer them into one spot.

3418
02:08:23,578 --> 02:08:24,895
Go and fish. Where you going?

3419
02:08:27,462 --> 02:08:28,462
Okay.

3420
02:08:29,495 --> 02:08:30,545
What the fuck.

3421
02:08:30,545 --> 02:08:32,579
Do they just one pass you.

3422
02:08:32,762 --> 02:08:35,029
Some of those swimming into the rocks.

3423
02:08:35,029 --> 02:08:37,680
I'm not supposed to do this.

3424
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,247
Light fire.

3425
02:08:38,247 --> 02:08:40,380
Catch one fish each. How?

3426
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:41,164
What?

3427
02:08:41,164 --> 02:08:44,297
How are we supposed to catch fish like

3428
02:08:46,448 --> 02:08:48,598
I feel like I'm missing something.

3429
02:08:48,598 --> 02:08:50,665
I mean, this fire is not yet, is it?

3430
02:08:50,965 --> 02:08:51,665
No, it's not.

3431
02:08:51,665 --> 02:08:54,849
Spear. Oh.

3432
02:08:54,849 --> 02:08:56,566
Are you kidding.

3433
02:08:56,566 --> 02:08:59,250
Me? You. You made us look like idiots.

3434
02:08:59,266 --> 02:09:02,917
I thought we were supposed to, like,
grab it off our hands for the fire.

3435
02:09:04,884 --> 02:09:06,684
This isn't fire enough for the fire.

3436
02:09:06,684 --> 02:09:08,134
Almost there.

3437
02:09:08,284 --> 02:09:09,901
Oh, I need more wood for the fire.

3438
02:09:09,901 --> 02:09:11,335
Wood for the fire.

3439
02:09:11,335 --> 02:09:12,268
Wait for the fire.

3440
02:09:12,268 --> 02:09:14,218
Get some more wood, bitch.

3441
02:09:14,218 --> 02:09:15,368
All right, I'll get the word.

3442
02:09:15,368 --> 02:09:16,469
You get the meal.

3443
02:09:16,469 --> 02:09:18,486
All right. Blowing and blowing.

3444
02:09:19,802 --> 02:09:20,619
Oh, this

3445
02:09:20,619 --> 02:09:23,586
is like what cavemen used to do
with their wives.

3446
02:09:24,236 --> 02:09:25,737
What? Blowing?

3447
02:09:26,103 --> 02:09:28,987
No, like,
one of them's going to, like, spear.

3448
02:09:28,987 --> 02:09:31,437
The other one's
going to prepare for the food for it.

3449
02:09:32,154 --> 02:09:33,271
How do I get there?

3450
02:09:33,271 --> 02:09:34,938
I think I need your help over here.

3451
02:09:34,938 --> 02:09:36,538
Yeah, we go. Yeah.

3452
02:09:36,538 --> 02:09:38,738
Come on. Herd. Herd the fish over.

3453
02:09:38,738 --> 02:09:39,372
Bring them to me.

3454
02:09:39,372 --> 02:09:41,605
All right, all right. All right.

3455
02:09:42,056 --> 02:09:42,489
I think.

3456
02:09:42,489 --> 02:09:44,706
Stand still. Yeah, yeah, I'll stay still.

3457
02:09:44,706 --> 02:09:46,956
I'm sharpening my tools again.

3458
02:09:46,956 --> 02:09:48,240
I'm comin.

3459
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,290
Oh, I don't even need you.

3460
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,873
I didn't even need you, bitch.

3461
02:09:50,873 --> 02:09:52,374
Look, that free fish.

3462
02:09:52,374 --> 02:09:53,707
Yeah, I don't need you.

3463
02:09:53,707 --> 02:09:56,157
Ever watch the ship?

3464
02:09:56,157 --> 02:09:58,858
Oh. Yeah, I can throw it.

3465
02:09:59,341 --> 02:10:00,508
No, you don't throw it.

3466
02:10:00,508 --> 02:10:02,575
You just got to starve. Them
when they're underneath. Yeah,

3467
02:10:04,075 --> 02:10:04,742
I know.

3468
02:10:04,742 --> 02:10:06,426
They eat my fish.

3469
02:10:06,776 --> 02:10:07,926
I watch the ship.

3470
02:10:07,926 --> 02:10:09,093
You. Yeah, I'll wait for you.

3471
02:10:09,093 --> 02:10:10,293
I'll wait for you.

3472
02:10:11,043 --> 02:10:18,877
Be courteous. OK?

3473
02:10:22,895 --> 02:10:24,895
What are you doing?

3474
02:10:24,895 --> 02:10:26,295
I'm waiting.

3475
02:10:26,378 --> 02:10:29,696
We are waiting for the fish to come in.

3476
02:10:30,629 --> 02:10:32,729
You're not going to come. Swords?

3477
02:10:32,729 --> 02:10:39,714
I was

3478
02:10:43,014 --> 02:10:44,948
come on.

3479
02:10:45,748 --> 02:10:47,465
How do I get it?

3480
02:10:47,465 --> 02:10:48,815
How did you get it?

3481
02:10:48,815 --> 02:10:50,015
I got. Lucky.

3482
02:10:50,015 --> 02:10:51,032
I think.

3483
02:10:52,499 --> 02:10:54,549
Oh. Well,

3484
02:10:56,616 --> 02:10:57,749
I can't stop laughing.

3485
02:10:57,749 --> 02:10:59,200
I just can't

3486
02:11:04,284 --> 02:11:05,401
it's so funny.

3487
02:11:05,401 --> 02:11:09,068
This is a fad so fast.

3488
02:11:09,268 --> 02:11:10,235
So quick.

3489
02:11:10,235 --> 02:11:12,902
Bob, I got this one.

3490
02:11:13,802 --> 02:11:15,869
Stupid fish. Oh, my God.

3491
02:11:16,569 --> 02:11:18,152
Oh, my God. You got it.

3492
02:11:18,152 --> 02:11:20,669
Dan, let's go. Oh, shit.

3493
02:11:21,186 --> 02:11:23,903
Let's go. Well,
you were just sitting there.

3494
02:11:23,903 --> 02:11:26,037
Yeah, I was walking also.

3495
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:27,870
I was. I'm.

3496
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:30,354
I'm way eating for you.

3497
02:11:30,421 --> 02:11:32,038
So we can eat together.

3498
02:11:33,388 --> 02:11:35,371
She could have helped me.

3499
02:11:35,521 --> 02:11:37,855
You could have helped me. Oh.

3500
02:11:38,105 --> 02:11:41,156
You just eat your fish sticks.

3501
02:11:41,156 --> 02:11:43,322
They stick where
I don't even get to eat it.

3502
02:11:45,873 --> 02:11:47,723
That tasted like shit, man.

3503
02:11:47,723 --> 02:11:49,923
Huh? Well, you know, it is what it is.

3504
02:11:49,957 --> 02:11:52,657
It is what it is.

3505
02:11:53,874 --> 02:11:56,274
And I fucking feel

3506
02:11:56,641 --> 02:11:58,625
you complain. What

3507
02:11:58,825 --> 02:11:59,775
I I'm good.

3508
02:11:59,775 --> 02:12:00,625
Really?

3509
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:02,492
So we're going to do this now, huh?

3510
02:12:02,492 --> 02:12:04,659
You come. In a. Lot now, huh?

3511
02:12:04,675 --> 02:12:05,609
Vince is just like.

3512
02:12:05,609 --> 02:12:07,893
Yeah, well,
I don't really like your attitude.

3513
02:12:07,976 --> 02:12:10,293
What are you in for? You're very snarky
all the time.

3514
02:12:10,326 --> 02:12:12,060
You know,
I don't know why you need to clean.

3515
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:14,160
Your nose in nice clean. You're used to.

3516
02:12:14,193 --> 02:12:16,444
You have no dry all the time.

3517
02:12:16,494 --> 02:12:18,994
I mean, I look at my collared shirt.

3518
02:12:19,027 --> 02:12:20,094
What do you have, bitch?

3519
02:12:20,094 --> 02:12:22,195
It's just a white t shirt.

3520
02:12:22,195 --> 02:12:23,761
I have layers.

3521
02:12:23,761 --> 02:12:26,012
You know about layers. You watch Shrek.

3522
02:12:26,012 --> 02:12:27,512
You probably don't want Shrek.

3523
02:12:27,512 --> 02:12:28,629
Back to basics.

3524
02:12:28,629 --> 02:12:31,263
Get with the times, bitch. You

3525
02:12:32,396 --> 02:12:35,080
the kiss you so hard on the face later.

3526
02:12:35,663 --> 02:12:36,447
Alex.

3527
02:12:36,447 --> 02:12:38,614
Oh, you set my face

3528
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,397
right into my.

3529
02:12:39,397 --> 02:12:41,064
Mouth, man.

3530
02:12:41,431 --> 02:12:41,964
Yeah.

3531
02:12:44,664 --> 02:12:47,315
Did you see my face

3532
02:12:49,082 --> 02:12:52,566
I. Got to get.

3533
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:57,400
They look as they are.

3534
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,533
Ha! Wow! OK,

3535
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:04,200
all right.

3536
02:13:05,634 --> 02:13:06,451
I was surprised.

3537
02:13:06,451 --> 02:13:08,484
That they got a logo in Daddy's
lap is free.

3538
02:13:09,535 --> 02:13:11,702
One day my brother brings in a new client.

3539
02:13:12,235 --> 02:13:15,535
I rather take a log than that
tiny peep money you have.

3540
02:13:16,085 --> 02:13:17,102
Yeah,

3541
02:13:18,219 --> 02:13:19,719
money was easy,

3542
02:13:19,719 --> 02:13:24,037
but Harvey just kept coming in with more
and more cash, and I couldn't handle it.

3543
02:13:24,537 --> 02:13:27,637
It was too risky,
so I told them I wanted out.

3544
02:13:29,137 --> 02:13:29,604
Emotional.

3545
02:13:29,604 --> 02:13:32,288
Damage, like brother as a warning.

3546
02:13:33,988 --> 02:13:36,388
After that, I lost it.

3547
02:13:36,788 --> 02:13:39,305
I planned on killing him,

3548
02:13:39,422 --> 02:13:41,672
but this son of
a bitch pinned it all on me.

3549
02:13:43,056 --> 02:13:45,656
I feel like we missed out on, like,
a good important.

3550
02:13:45,656 --> 02:13:46,390
Part of murder.

3551
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:50,274
Because I'm lost right now. Wow.

3552
02:13:51,674 --> 02:13:54,391
Fucking rough, man. Mysta..

3553
02:13:54,391 --> 02:13:55,524
Yes. Man.

3554
02:13:55,524 --> 02:13:58,475
So sorry.

3555
02:13:58,475 --> 02:14:00,075
Why are you so sad?

3556
02:14:00,075 --> 02:14:01,208
So messed up?

3557
02:14:01,208 --> 02:14:03,209
What's your story with Harvey, huh?

3558
02:14:03,209 --> 02:14:05,226
I saw you get you good. Yeah, I'm good.

3559
02:14:05,859 --> 02:14:06,459
I'm good.

3560
02:14:06,626 --> 02:14:09,126
OK, ok. I'm good.

3561
02:14:09,126 --> 02:14:11,993
You're is good.

3562
02:14:11,993 --> 02:14:14,010
Yes. Nice. Compact.

3563
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,044
Compact. That's the right word.

3564
02:14:16,044 --> 02:14:17,994
Thank you for closing in.

3565
02:14:17,994 --> 02:14:19,328
We got to move.

3566
02:14:20,094 --> 02:14:21,995
Oh, my fucking feet.

3567
02:14:21,995 --> 02:14:24,278
See? There you go.
Complaining again about. It.

3568
02:14:24,278 --> 02:14:25,712
I got it. OK.

3569
02:14:25,712 --> 02:14:25,929
You know.

3570
02:14:25,929 --> 02:14:28,646
Do you want me to rub your front OK? Sure.

3571
02:14:29,079 --> 02:14:30,579
You're aware of your feet.

3572
02:14:30,579 --> 02:14:32,196
You can rub your feet as an apology.

3573
02:14:32,196 --> 02:14:33,580
I'll rub your feet

3574
02:14:34,030 --> 02:14:35,730
a little.
You're telling me. You suck my toes?

3575
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,963
Yeah. You

3576
02:14:38,164 --> 02:14:41,214
oh, my God.

3577
02:14:41,214 --> 02:14:43,564
You know me so well.

3578
02:14:45,548 --> 02:14:47,582
And I'm kind of forced to.

3579
02:14:47,582 --> 02:14:49,082
So you used to work in a bank.

3580
02:14:49,082 --> 02:14:50,949
Oh, is that how it is?

3581
02:14:50,949 --> 02:14:51,699
What are you implying?

3582
02:14:51,699 --> 02:14:52,216
Look at me.

3583
02:14:52,216 --> 02:14:54,216
Well, to see my moves.

3584
02:14:54,216 --> 02:14:55,899
You're kind of uptight.

3585
02:14:55,899 --> 02:14:57,300
I'm sorry. Now type in.

3586
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:58,867
A loose cannon.

3587
02:14:58,867 --> 02:15:00,283
Thanks for the compliment.

3588
02:15:00,283 --> 02:15:01,984
You OK?

3589
02:15:02,484 --> 02:15:03,334
You know what?

3590
02:15:03,684 --> 02:15:06,318
What you saw? The first thing.

3591
02:15:06,568 --> 02:15:10,435
The bank that I've talked to you.

3592
02:15:12,552 --> 02:15:14,669
You losing brain.

3593
02:15:14,669 --> 02:15:16,869
Cells. I'm losing actual brain cells.

3594
02:15:16,869 --> 02:15:19,319
Components of persevere right now.

3595
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:23,253
You solids.

3596
02:15:23,253 --> 02:15:25,887
You still believe bones are in your dick?

3597
02:15:27,237 --> 02:15:28,704
Why else would they call it a boner?

3598
02:15:28,704 --> 02:15:30,054
First of all, you. Still believe that.

3599
02:15:30,054 --> 02:15:31,688
You still believe that? No.

3600
02:15:31,688 --> 02:15:32,905
But you can understand why.

3601
02:15:32,905 --> 02:15:35,888
I believe to kind. Of understand kind of.

3602
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:39,205
Your ribs. Have flexible bones, you know.

3603
02:15:39,606 --> 02:15:43,389
When you say that's not is it is
if it's a very flexible bone rib

3604
02:15:43,706 --> 02:15:44,973
when you breathe in and out.

3605
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:51,624
Oh. Your rib cage expands and expands.

3606
02:15:51,874 --> 02:15:54,508
So you think that's how
that's how it worked with figure dick.

3607
02:15:56,375 --> 02:15:56,825
That's solid work.

3608
02:15:56,825 --> 02:15:59,408
So bones are bendable like your fingers

3609
02:16:00,875 --> 02:16:01,559
bend those.

3610
02:16:01,559 --> 02:16:03,392
I have joints. There.

3611
02:16:03,392 --> 02:16:04,109
There's there's a.

3612
02:16:04,109 --> 02:16:07,109
Thing called joints, you know, mom's right

3613
02:16:08,276 --> 02:16:10,927
now these are still well.

3614
02:16:11,343 --> 02:16:13,477
Bendable me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

3615
02:16:14,194 --> 02:16:16,327
The fugitives are still at large.

3616
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:18,144
I considered are so stupid.

3617
02:16:18,144 --> 02:16:20,728
You're so stupid. Please put that off.

3618
02:16:20,728 --> 02:16:23,162
She has a gun only I just found this.

3619
02:16:23,162 --> 02:16:25,479
She just have a gun on the table.

3620
02:16:25,479 --> 02:16:26,729
Don't you worry, honey.

3621
02:16:26,729 --> 02:16:28,829
Those two fools. That's
what it's like in America.

3622
02:16:28,829 --> 02:16:31,113
You just have this on the table.

3623
02:16:31,196 --> 02:16:34,197
I guess so. I mean, this is America.

3624
02:16:34,197 --> 02:16:35,580
This is America.

3625
02:16:35,813 --> 02:16:38,597
Yes. I caught up my breakfast
about my shotgun on the table.

3626
02:16:38,597 --> 02:16:40,614
That man.
I mean, we tied him up with something.

3627
02:16:42,214 --> 02:16:42,664
Clothes.

3628
02:16:42,664 --> 02:16:44,215
We can't walk around like this.

3629
02:16:44,215 --> 02:16:45,181
I don't like it.

3630
02:16:45,181 --> 02:16:47,465
It's better to get them out of the house.

3631
02:16:47,465 --> 02:16:48,399
What you have in mind.

3632
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:49,349
All we get, it's hot.

3633
02:16:49,349 --> 02:16:51,749
Oh, see that barn over there?

3634
02:16:51,749 --> 02:16:53,016
Smooth. Right?

3635
02:16:53,016 --> 02:16:55,566
We release the horses. Mm. You move.

3636
02:16:55,633 --> 02:16:56,366
Yeah. Milk.

3637
02:16:56,366 --> 02:16:57,633
You trust me?

3638
02:16:57,633 --> 02:17:00,367
Oh, he'll be forced to go get them back.

3639
02:17:00,684 --> 02:17:03,334
Oh, God. No mind

3640
02:17:03,934 --> 02:17:06,218
release the horses or subdue the couple.

3641
02:17:07,985 --> 02:17:09,418
I want to release the horses.

3642
02:17:09,418 --> 02:17:11,218
Yeah, release the horses.
That's all. Fine.

3643
02:17:11,218 --> 02:17:13,169
Whatever, man. Let's try.

3644
02:17:13,169 --> 02:17:14,069
OK, come on.

3645
02:17:14,069 --> 02:17:15,602
We don't need to kill anyone now.

3646
02:17:15,602 --> 02:17:16,986
Are we gonna kill the couple?

3647
02:17:16,986 --> 02:17:18,986
We didn't do anything.

3648
02:17:18,986 --> 02:17:21,036
Get the horses out of here.

3649
02:17:21,036 --> 02:17:22,170
It's locked.

3650
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:22,987
Yeah.

3651
02:17:23,937 --> 02:17:27,187
Can horses even survive in the wild

3652
02:17:27,271 --> 02:17:29,138
horses? Yeah, there's wild horses.

3653
02:17:29,138 --> 02:17:31,138
You play Minecraft.
What else should they have?

3654
02:17:31,288 --> 02:17:34,888
So, yeah,
but in microfossils, a red dust explode.

3655
02:17:35,255 --> 02:17:36,689
I mean, green. Red

3656
02:17:39,006 --> 02:17:40,006
what?

3657
02:17:41,256 --> 02:17:43,323
Green, green.

3658
02:17:43,323 --> 02:17:44,290
Yeah, but.

3659
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:46,990
Like,
there's also cows and pigs in sheds here.

3660
02:17:47,073 --> 02:17:50,040
It's like saying, like, oh,
there's a cowboy there.

3661
02:17:54,108 --> 02:17:54,541
I want it.

3662
02:17:54,541 --> 02:17:55,858
Can we touch it?

3663
02:17:55,925 --> 02:17:56,858
I don't think so.

3664
02:17:56,858 --> 02:17:58,892
I think we can get over
at least the horses.

3665
02:17:59,425 --> 02:18:00,575
Hello.

3666
02:18:01,325 --> 02:18:04,409
My re going to do.

3667
02:18:04,442 --> 02:18:05,343
What are you doing?

3668
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:06,726
Sorry, my hand.

3669
02:18:06,726 --> 02:18:09,543
I can't help but thinking about
a big juicy steak right now.

3670
02:18:09,693 --> 02:18:11,343
It's fucked up. What off?

3671
02:18:11,343 --> 02:18:13,177
He doesn't like you.

3672
02:18:13,177 --> 02:18:14,694
He doesn't like you. Get out!

3673
02:18:14,694 --> 02:18:16,628
Oh, my God. You do it in his face.

3674
02:18:16,628 --> 02:18:17,611
That's not how you treat a cow.

3675
02:18:17,611 --> 02:18:20,545
Look, watch the master.

3676
02:18:20,545 --> 02:18:22,145
What the fuck?

3677
02:18:22,145 --> 02:18:24,695
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3678
02:18:24,695 --> 02:18:27,029
Yeah, he likes me. Wait. Let me try again.

3679
02:18:27,062 --> 02:18:28,963
Ooh, ooh.

3680
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:32,796
You know, you don't understand.

3681
02:18:32,796 --> 02:18:33,963
He doesn't. You don't understand.

3682
02:18:33,963 --> 02:18:35,697
You don't understand how it is.

3683
02:18:35,697 --> 02:18:37,714
C c you stink.

3684
02:18:38,364 --> 02:18:39,481
Stink more than the cow.

3685
02:18:40,948 --> 02:18:43,381
What you're
saying the cows normally stink.

3686
02:18:43,381 --> 02:18:44,398
You try to say.

3687
02:18:44,998 --> 02:18:46,082
I mean.

3688
02:18:47,248 --> 02:18:48,249
I mean.

3689
02:18:48,249 --> 02:18:49,265
I mean.

3690
02:18:49,382 --> 02:18:51,366
You know, my lord,
I don't know if you have this problem.

3691
02:18:51,366 --> 02:18:55,666
I mean, every time someone says fuck,
you might wake up.

3692
02:18:55,833 --> 02:18:58,433
How bad? Every time someone says what?

3693
02:18:58,433 --> 02:18:59,850
Every time someone says, cow girl.

3694
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:03,834
I think of like, cow girls,
you know, like others.

3695
02:19:05,551 --> 02:19:07,585
I mean, isn't that what that means?

3696
02:19:07,585 --> 02:19:08,168
Like.

3697
02:19:08,585 --> 02:19:13,385
Oh, like they're supposed to be, like,
cowgirl, like the cowboy, but with a girl,

3698
02:19:13,586 --> 02:19:14,369
you know,

3699
02:19:17,186 --> 02:19:19,736
we know the ha oh.

3700
02:19:19,736 --> 02:19:21,087
Like, way, huh?

3701
02:19:21,087 --> 02:19:21,337
Yeah.

3702
02:19:21,337 --> 02:19:22,203
Yeah, exactly.

3703
02:19:22,203 --> 02:19:25,020
OK, I'm not alone in that. Then

3704
02:19:25,537 --> 02:19:27,187
okay. Hold on, hold on.

3705
02:19:27,187 --> 02:19:28,921
What's the original?

3706
02:19:28,921 --> 02:19:29,288
I thought.

3707
02:19:29,288 --> 02:19:31,588
I thought you could be a cow. What?

3708
02:19:31,588 --> 02:19:32,972
How, girl?

3709
02:19:32,972 --> 02:19:35,822
Yeah, ok. I never heard of the cow girl.

3710
02:19:35,855 --> 02:19:36,789
Like the position

3711
02:19:38,706 --> 02:19:40,089
the position.

3712
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:42,006
What's the position?

3713
02:19:42,006 --> 02:19:44,273
That was his. Should I look it up?

3714
02:19:44,273 --> 02:19:45,057
Hold on.

3715
02:19:46,073 --> 02:19:46,707
Give me a second.

3716
02:19:46,707 --> 02:19:47,574
Give me a second.

3717
02:19:47,574 --> 02:19:48,807
Cowgirl.

3718
02:19:48,807 --> 02:19:50,424
Position

3719
02:19:52,408 --> 02:19:55,375
Cowgirl sex position works best
if you bend slightly

3720
02:19:55,375 --> 02:19:57,908
forward over your partner
allowing your quotes.

3721
02:19:59,525 --> 02:20:00,459
OK? OK.

3722
02:20:00,459 --> 02:20:00,759
All right.

3723
02:20:00,759 --> 02:20:03,276
I see. I get it now. I get it now.

3724
02:20:03,276 --> 02:20:04,326
Thank you, miss.

3725
02:20:04,326 --> 02:20:04,926
Thank you.

3726
02:20:04,926 --> 02:20:08,276
I, i tell. Them why, why, why, why?

3727
02:20:08,293 --> 02:20:11,644
You bring that up for why all girls.

3728
02:20:11,844 --> 02:20:13,777
Oh, would you put that up for us?

3729
02:20:13,777 --> 02:20:15,994
It's a horse. Pelicans, a horse.

3730
02:20:15,994 --> 02:20:17,728
I like others.

3731
02:20:17,728 --> 02:20:19,378
First release the horse. How you do.

3732
02:20:19,378 --> 02:20:21,728
Then we push this piece of shit
down. Bitch.

3733
02:20:21,812 --> 02:20:25,146
I like those big mummy milk because.

3734
02:20:25,146 --> 02:20:26,996
They're not. Even.

3735
02:20:27,296 --> 02:20:29,796
Do you like udders or do you like weight?

3736
02:20:30,363 --> 02:20:32,213
Which one?
Which one are you talking about?

3737
02:20:32,213 --> 02:20:34,197
You're talking about two
different things right now.

3738
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:37,547
Right here.

3739
02:20:37,547 --> 02:20:39,298
You're talking
about two different things right now.

3740
02:20:39,298 --> 02:20:40,648
What's happening?

3741
02:20:40,648 --> 02:20:41,998
You're like, Mama.

3742
02:20:41,998 --> 02:20:42,748
I like it. Please.

3743
02:20:42,748 --> 02:20:43,615
I like otters.

3744
02:20:43,615 --> 02:20:47,465
Yeah, it was mommy milk white fever. Yup.

3745
02:20:48,032 --> 02:20:49,599
Let's free them all.

3746
02:20:50,316 --> 02:20:51,283
Oh, my God.

3747
02:20:51,283 --> 02:20:52,649
We shot this.

3748
02:20:52,716 --> 02:20:53,499
Why can't we just.

3749
02:20:53,499 --> 02:20:55,016
Take the horses with us?

3750
02:20:55,016 --> 02:20:56,883
Why can't we ride them?

3751
02:20:57,233 --> 02:20:59,134
You can just shut up for one minute.

3752
02:20:59,134 --> 02:21:01,867
Can we just take the horses and say,
fuck the couple?

3753
02:21:03,518 --> 02:21:06,685
I mean, the horses are going
to get released and then it's locked.

3754
02:21:06,901 --> 02:21:08,485
It's locked. Can't open this one.

3755
02:21:08,485 --> 02:21:09,835
Wait, where are you?

3756
02:21:09,835 --> 02:21:10,152
A horse?

3757
02:21:10,152 --> 02:21:12,285
Yeah, we have to open the other one.

3758
02:21:13,119 --> 02:21:14,902
This one behind you.

3759
02:21:15,086 --> 02:21:17,036
You make a chicken noise.

3760
02:21:17,036 --> 02:21:18,036
I tried to open this.

3761
02:21:18,036 --> 02:21:20,320
It was close. Dumb-ass.

3762
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:23,070
OK, we'll call.
We both do at the same time.

3763
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:24,004
No, it's not.

3764
02:21:25,287 --> 02:21:26,037
Light bulb.

3765
02:21:26,037 --> 02:21:27,304
With this lab.

3766
02:21:28,504 --> 02:21:30,688
We're doing the light bulb lamp.

3767
02:21:30,688 --> 02:21:32,888
And I know how we go.

3768
02:21:33,238 --> 02:21:35,022
OK, what's the point of that?

3769
02:21:35,022 --> 02:21:36,439
What's the point of that?

3770
02:21:36,439 --> 02:21:38,756
We're fixing that fucking barn for them.

3771
02:21:39,089 --> 02:21:41,223
What's OK?

3772
02:21:41,223 --> 02:21:43,290
Yeah,
maybe maybe you unlocked a secret ending

3773
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:44,790
and they're like,
oh, who fixed our lights?

3774
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:47,107
Oh, it must have been those two kind
gentlemen that came by.

3775
02:21:47,257 --> 02:21:51,658
Oh, we just did some partially, you know,
and they'll show up in our trial.

3776
02:21:51,658 --> 02:21:54,408
And vouch for us, work

3777
02:21:54,658 --> 02:21:55,225
on Dong.

3778
02:21:55,225 --> 02:21:57,025
Dong.

3779
02:21:57,025 --> 02:21:59,009
Not loud enough.

3780
02:21:59,259 --> 02:22:00,626
Mami.

3781
02:22:01,209 --> 02:22:02,759
Oh, my God. What is that?

3782
02:22:02,759 --> 02:22:03,959
It's a going to work.

3783
02:22:03,959 --> 02:22:06,210
Or maybe I can get back out, like, on

3784
02:22:07,527 --> 02:22:08,677
the fuck.

3785
02:22:10,477 --> 02:22:13,427
Oh, I don't know what to do.

3786
02:22:14,044 --> 02:22:15,961
I ever.

3787
02:22:16,178 --> 02:22:18,028
I'm looking for everything right now.

3788
02:22:18,028 --> 02:22:18,595
Everything

3789
02:22:20,228 --> 02:22:20,728
I'm looking.

3790
02:22:20,728 --> 02:22:21,929
For you leave now.

3791
02:22:21,929 --> 02:22:22,795
And I push this.

3792
02:22:22,795 --> 02:22:24,146
I'm slopping in. There.

3793
02:22:24,146 --> 02:22:26,979
And I'm just putting him slap me.

3794
02:22:26,979 --> 02:22:27,663
OK, you do this.

3795
02:22:27,663 --> 02:22:28,479
So come on.

3796
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:31,413
Oh, oh, now we have to do that.

3797
02:22:31,413 --> 02:22:32,397
Now we could do something.

3798
02:22:32,397 --> 02:22:35,280
OK, we just had to let the horses out
first.

3799
02:22:37,147 --> 02:22:38,331
Where are you?

3800
02:22:38,348 --> 02:22:40,765
Well, I'm a pit stop.

3801
02:22:40,981 --> 02:22:42,215
Like. This myself.

3802
02:22:42,215 --> 02:22:44,215
Come on, Vincent, over here.

3803
02:22:44,215 --> 02:22:46,615
Yes. So blind

3804
02:22:46,832 --> 02:22:47,882
oh, hey.

3805
02:22:47,882 --> 02:22:51,416
He's so blind. Blend in my defence.

3806
02:22:51,416 --> 02:22:54,666
You blend in with the background
pretty well.

3807
02:22:54,666 --> 02:22:56,033
Fuck you, man.

3808
02:22:56,333 --> 02:22:58,384
Oh, oh,

3809
02:23:01,134 --> 02:23:01,734
oh, my God.

3810
02:23:01,734 --> 02:23:03,234
That's so strong.

3811
02:23:03,868 --> 02:23:05,851
Oh, hell, the horses are escaping.

3812
02:23:05,851 --> 02:23:07,352
Honey. What?

3813
02:23:07,352 --> 02:23:10,769
What kind of horses are escaping?

3814
02:23:10,769 --> 02:23:11,919
Honey,

3815
02:23:12,752 --> 02:23:14,686
it didn't seem that bothered to be.

3816
02:23:14,686 --> 02:23:15,569
Oh, he is.

3817
02:23:15,569 --> 02:23:21,003
He's running like one more power
I mean, they're old and, like, hey, you.

3818
02:23:21,537 --> 02:23:24,121
Yeah, look, just once, but it's.

3819
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:25,404
Probably happened before.

3820
02:23:25,404 --> 02:23:27,338
You know, it's not the first time, though.

3821
02:23:27,338 --> 02:23:29,605
How the shame horses escaped

3822
02:23:31,838 --> 02:23:33,422
OK, we got to be quick about this shit.

3823
02:23:33,422 --> 02:23:35,589
They're got to come back
once they get the horses.

3824
02:23:35,589 --> 02:23:36,839
All right, I'm going, I'm going.

3825
02:23:36,839 --> 02:23:37,956
Then I'm going to catch two horses.

3826
02:23:37,956 --> 02:23:40,540
They're running like one of our

3827
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:41,840
yeah.

3828
02:23:42,773 --> 02:23:43,740
I don't know, man.

3829
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:46,290
The country folk
or party are pretty sturdy.

3830
02:23:47,307 --> 02:23:49,741
Found the way. And wait,
I think. Oh, wait.

3831
02:23:49,741 --> 02:23:50,758
Oh, my God.

3832
02:23:50,758 --> 02:23:53,191
There was a door that. Oh, Frank, call
somebody.

3833
02:23:53,191 --> 02:23:54,958
OK, I found the TV.

3834
02:23:54,958 --> 02:23:57,775
Welcome back to our show,
Paranormal Activity. And.

3835
02:23:58,292 --> 02:24:00,326
Oh, man, the Cold War may be perfect.

3836
02:24:00,326 --> 02:24:02,443
That you will claim.

3837
02:24:02,443 --> 02:24:04,960
Oh, I. Called my wife.

3838
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,193
When he finally saw fresh water.

3839
02:24:08,227 --> 02:24:10,177
Ooh, fresh water.

3840
02:24:10,177 --> 02:24:12,594
Are you going? Were you doing over there?

3841
02:24:12,594 --> 02:24:14,011
What were you doing?

3842
02:24:14,011 --> 02:24:15,995
I'm looking for clues.

3843
02:24:16,328 --> 02:24:17,578
You're looking for clues?

3844
02:24:17,578 --> 02:24:18,845
What kind of clues?

3845
02:24:19,895 --> 02:24:21,695
Uh, hold on.

3846
02:24:21,695 --> 02:24:23,646
And from what? My foot. Yeah.

3847
02:24:23,646 --> 02:24:24,779
Hey, hey.

3848
02:24:24,779 --> 02:24:27,246
No, no, no. No.

3849
02:24:27,246 --> 02:24:28,196
Can you move?

3850
02:24:28,196 --> 02:24:30,563
Move, like, two centimetres in left. How?

3851
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:33,814
When did you have a left?

3852
02:24:33,814 --> 02:24:37,081
And you had this pretty good
looking bitch?

3853
02:24:37,081 --> 02:24:39,648
Give me a lap dance right now
to levitate you.

3854
02:24:40,015 --> 02:24:41,198
You were. Useless.

3855
02:24:41,198 --> 02:24:41,998
I was.

3856
02:24:41,998 --> 02:24:43,315
You interrupted me in the being.

3857
02:24:43,315 --> 02:24:44,649
No, stay there.

3858
02:24:44,649 --> 02:24:45,332
How do you.

3859
02:24:45,332 --> 02:24:46,799
How did you. Find?

3860
02:24:46,799 --> 02:24:48,149
I'm gonna stay there.

3861
02:24:48,149 --> 02:24:50,616
Say they're. And Gordon. Gordon.

3862
02:24:51,516 --> 02:24:52,766
Not until. You turn off the TV.

3863
02:24:52,766 --> 02:24:55,133
Because this
is this a personal moment yet?

3864
02:24:55,317 --> 02:24:57,067
Pay attention to me. All right?

3865
02:24:57,067 --> 02:24:57,717
All right.

3866
02:25:02,884 --> 02:25:03,718
You like that.

3867
02:25:03,718 --> 02:25:06,868
The one 8360 manoeuvre the rich round.

3868
02:25:06,868 --> 02:25:08,552
I call this the rich realm.
Oh, look at this.

3869
02:25:08,552 --> 02:25:10,719
I have never been so blessed in my life.

3870
02:25:11,186 --> 02:25:14,036
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

3871
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,753
yeah, it is.

3872
02:25:18,037 --> 02:25:18,787
I didn't know it was.

3873
02:25:18,787 --> 02:25:21,387
Possible to be blessed. Blessed did.

3874
02:25:21,637 --> 02:25:22,170
Good and.

3875
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:23,071
Holy shit.

3876
02:25:23,071 --> 02:25:24,487
Can we take the matches?

3877
02:25:24,487 --> 02:25:26,754
I only take them. Yes.

3878
02:25:26,888 --> 02:25:28,021
That looks good.

3879
02:25:28,021 --> 02:25:29,255
Far away.

3880
02:25:29,255 --> 02:25:30,038
Oh, no, this is.

3881
02:25:30,038 --> 02:25:32,038
This is more like the rapids. Ah.

3882
02:25:32,038 --> 02:25:33,939
What is your high?

3883
02:25:33,939 --> 02:25:34,706
Holy shit.

3884
02:25:34,706 --> 02:25:35,339
Hold on, hold on.

3885
02:25:35,339 --> 02:25:35,906
Hold on.

3886
02:25:35,906 --> 02:25:39,239
Boy, I want to go to tryouts and close
till.

3887
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:40,256
You have a grip.

3888
02:25:40,256 --> 02:25:43,207
Can we take that fool?

3889
02:25:43,223 --> 02:25:44,940
I got Lucas hot hillbilly.

3890
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:48,124
Oh, no, well, you say hillbilly.

3891
02:25:49,524 --> 02:25:51,691
What does like hillbilly?

3892
02:25:52,075 --> 02:25:53,158
It's just solidly. On the hill.

3893
02:25:53,158 --> 02:25:54,625
It's slang for.

3894
02:25:54,625 --> 02:25:56,125
I've never really been a hard man.

3895
02:25:56,125 --> 02:25:59,526
Oh, I'm not a hot person, dammit. OK.

3896
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:03,093
Oh, look, you are a child.

3897
02:26:03,093 --> 02:26:05,226
You are an absolute child.

3898
02:26:05,426 --> 02:26:06,877
What is that, huh?

3899
02:26:06,877 --> 02:26:08,160
What the fuck is that?

3900
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,644
I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to.

3901
02:26:10,644 --> 02:26:11,244
Oh, my God.

3902
02:26:11,244 --> 02:26:13,261
I'm going to build this. Oh,
I wiped it off.

3903
02:26:13,261 --> 02:26:16,528
Oh, shit. Bob, oh.

3904
02:26:18,245 --> 02:26:20,912
I corrected his his on his errors.

3905
02:26:21,529 --> 02:26:23,546
But when you do one of two new fancy
models.

3906
02:26:24,996 --> 02:26:26,129
Can you can you move?

3907
02:26:26,129 --> 02:26:26,980
So I. Can.

3908
02:26:26,996 --> 02:26:30,413
He moves so I can see what's happening.

3909
02:26:34,781 --> 02:26:36,264
I'm very.

3910
02:26:36,264 --> 02:26:37,048
Good at this. This.

3911
02:26:37,048 --> 02:26:38,214
What is he playing?

3912
02:26:38,214 --> 02:26:40,348
Oh, from scratch, I guess.

3913
02:26:41,648 --> 02:26:44,949
All. All or all.

3914
02:26:44,965 --> 02:26:47,466
We cannot what I wanted to do.

3915
02:26:47,466 --> 02:26:49,833
I want to build a house of cards down it.

3916
02:26:50,433 --> 02:26:51,266
Oh, here we go.

3917
02:26:51,266 --> 02:26:54,567
Change clothes. All right. Don't look.

3918
02:26:54,567 --> 02:26:55,767
No. Yeah.

3919
02:26:55,767 --> 02:26:58,267
Oh, like a peeping tom.

3920
02:26:58,267 --> 02:26:59,167
No, no, I can.

3921
02:26:59,167 --> 02:27:02,068
I can. I can smell you, like, in Somalia.

3922
02:27:02,068 --> 02:27:04,568
All right, I got a fucking gun.

3923
02:27:04,568 --> 02:27:06,535
Did you get that gun?

3924
02:27:09,002 --> 02:27:11,336
All right, sir, I'm ready.

3925
02:27:12,569 --> 02:27:14,019
OK? You don't look

3926
02:27:15,486 --> 02:27:17,220
dumb, okay?

3927
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,637
You ready for this? You ready for this?

3928
02:27:18,637 --> 02:27:20,554
Come of massive drip.

3929
02:27:20,554 --> 02:27:21,420
All Yeah.

3930
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:23,671
Oh, yeah. Look at me.

3931
02:27:23,704 --> 02:27:25,504
Look at the floor. Old pattern.

3932
02:27:25,504 --> 02:27:27,055
You forgot. To drip.

3933
02:27:27,055 --> 02:27:28,955
Yes, I bet it is germ.

3934
02:27:28,955 --> 02:27:30,722
Oh, we get all.

3935
02:27:30,722 --> 02:27:32,072
If you want to use it for.

3936
02:27:32,072 --> 02:27:33,839
This comfortable. I think we can wait.

3937
02:27:33,839 --> 02:27:36,273
Is that kind of fucked? Up
to fuck on another couple of spat?

3938
02:27:37,589 --> 02:27:39,040
Um. I think it

3939
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,073
depends if you know them well enough.

3940
02:27:42,073 --> 02:27:43,624
You don't know them. Yeah, we don't know.

3941
02:27:43,624 --> 02:27:45,657
That's fine. I mean. Are
you aren't you into that stuff?

3942
02:27:45,657 --> 02:27:45,991
I always.

3943
02:27:45,991 --> 02:27:47,307
Family's kind of like.

3944
02:27:47,307 --> 02:27:49,808
Non-Toxic relationships or whatever.

3945
02:27:49,808 --> 02:27:50,941
Ntaiya.

3946
02:27:51,541 --> 02:27:52,825
Yeah. Mm hmm.

3947
02:27:52,825 --> 02:27:54,625
I think it's OK sometimes.

3948
02:27:54,625 --> 02:27:56,792
I started with everything, you know?

3949
02:27:56,792 --> 02:28:00,309
You know,
I saw a fucking thing before my eyes.

3950
02:28:00,576 --> 02:28:02,943
I made a joke.
I don't actually like NTR chat.

3951
02:28:03,126 --> 02:28:05,310
If I said it as a joke one time.

3952
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:07,560
And some
I saw some fucking, like, hate coming.

3953
02:28:07,577 --> 02:28:08,194
I was like.

3954
02:28:08,194 --> 02:28:08,877
This fucking.

3955
02:28:08,877 --> 02:28:11,194
Cut. Claude, what the fuck is this?

3956
02:28:11,277 --> 02:28:12,328
I'm sobbing.

3957
02:28:12,328 --> 02:28:15,178
It's like, what the fuck did way oh, god.

3958
02:28:16,378 --> 02:28:17,845
What's up?

3959
02:28:17,845 --> 02:28:19,379
I think we just lost a joke.

3960
02:28:19,379 --> 02:28:20,045
You know something?

3961
02:28:20,045 --> 02:28:22,596
I think we just left
fingerprints all over this fucking house.

3962
02:28:23,996 --> 02:28:25,563
Oh, my God.

3963
02:28:27,646 --> 02:28:28,163
I'm. I'm worried.

3964
02:28:28,163 --> 02:28:29,313
About that.

3965
02:28:29,713 --> 02:28:30,263
Why are you worried?

3966
02:28:30,263 --> 02:28:32,730
We just shoot them and kill them
so you don't.

3967
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:34,681
Actually like NCR?

3968
02:28:34,681 --> 02:28:38,615
Know what
I guess we won't make funny at this point.

3969
02:28:38,615 --> 02:28:40,265
Said, I know. I don't.

3970
02:28:40,265 --> 02:28:41,198
I'm not disappointed.

3971
02:28:41,198 --> 02:28:44,165
Why are you putting words into my mouth?

3972
02:28:44,365 --> 02:28:45,449
I'm not disappointed.

3973
02:28:45,449 --> 02:28:47,649
What's I'm not too surprised?

3974
02:28:47,649 --> 02:28:49,533
I can change for you if you like it.

3975
02:28:49,533 --> 02:28:51,300
Now, you don't have to change.

3976
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:53,183
I was just shocked.

3977
02:28:53,183 --> 02:28:54,450
Because this entire time, it's

3978
02:28:54,450 --> 02:28:57,984
like for the past few months,
like, what, four months, five months?

3979
02:28:58,234 --> 02:29:00,784
This entire time, I. Thought, like,
hey, you.

3980
02:29:00,868 --> 02:29:02,185
You know, good for you.

3981
02:29:02,185 --> 02:29:03,035
I guess you.

3982
02:29:03,035 --> 02:29:05,818
Could relate to me or something.
No, I didn't. Think I could relate to you.

3983
02:29:05,835 --> 02:29:06,602
Stop it.

3984
02:29:06,602 --> 02:29:09,819
Stop trying to make an image.

3985
02:29:10,886 --> 02:29:12,153
Mysta. Miss that. Mysta..

3986
02:29:12,153 --> 02:29:14,520
Look, look, I can like what you like.

3987
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:19,437
I was just surprise that information
I had about you this entire time.

3988
02:29:19,754 --> 02:29:21,571
So it's not Suzie.

3989
02:29:21,571 --> 02:29:24,988
It's not Suzie. You're Suzie.

3990
02:29:25,054 --> 02:29:27,455
And we will pet the cow again.

3991
02:29:27,788 --> 02:29:29,255
Will you pet. Me? Yeah.

3992
02:29:29,255 --> 02:29:31,105
That's what I'm talking about.

3993
02:29:31,105 --> 02:29:34,039
Oh, wow. Not

3994
02:29:35,739 --> 02:29:37,706
where the fuck is the truck, bro?

3995
02:29:37,706 --> 02:29:40,057
Yeah. I don't know where the truck is.

3996
02:29:40,057 --> 02:29:41,340
There's a truck that.

3997
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:43,207
Maybe it's back this way.

3998
02:29:43,557 --> 02:29:46,807
No, it's not maybe it's in the back.

3999
02:29:46,807 --> 02:29:48,958
Maybe we're just completely dumb.

4000
02:29:48,958 --> 02:29:51,175
I didn't even know there was a truck,
to be completely honest.

4001
02:29:51,842 --> 02:29:53,125
Oh, maybe it's down here.

4002
02:29:53,125 --> 02:29:54,725
Look at those fields. Of corn.

4003
02:29:54,725 --> 02:29:55,475
Holy shit.

4004
02:29:55,475 --> 02:29:57,509
Oh, that's not corn.

4005
02:29:57,559 --> 02:29:59,559
What is that? Here it. Is.

4006
02:29:59,559 --> 02:30:01,926
I don't need.
No, no, no, no. Give it here.

4007
02:30:01,926 --> 02:30:02,943
Oh, give me a fucking.

4008
02:30:02,943 --> 02:30:04,377
Give me a second. I don't know. If.

4009
02:30:04,377 --> 02:30:07,044
I would like to look. Around. Okay,

4010
02:30:08,277 --> 02:30:09,094
I'll show you.

4011
02:30:09,094 --> 02:30:10,861
Chop wood. I'll help them out.

4012
02:30:10,861 --> 02:30:11,944
Might as well help them out.

4013
02:30:11,944 --> 02:30:13,078
Oh, sure.

4014
02:30:14,345 --> 02:30:16,445
Damn.

4015
02:30:16,445 --> 02:30:17,228
Oh, look at me.

4016
02:30:17,228 --> 02:30:17,545
Look at me.

4017
02:30:17,545 --> 02:30:20,079
You're selling the house three.

4018
02:30:20,079 --> 02:30:21,629
Can you do this shit?

4019
02:30:21,629 --> 02:30:23,129
You do this. You can do that.

4020
02:30:23,129 --> 02:30:24,546
I could do that with one hand.

4021
02:30:24,546 --> 02:30:28,530
This look this far, OK, number five

4022
02:30:29,163 --> 02:30:31,530
or six

4023
02:30:33,564 --> 02:30:35,281
or your turn, bitch. Go.

4024
02:30:35,281 --> 02:30:36,114
You try.

4025
02:30:38,065 --> 02:30:38,665
Let's chop.

4026
02:30:38,665 --> 02:30:39,998
What's a shell?

4027
02:30:40,115 --> 02:30:41,515
Let's chop some wood.

4028
02:30:41,515 --> 02:30:43,149
This is how you do it.

4029
02:30:43,149 --> 02:30:45,782
Come look at speed.

4030
02:30:46,866 --> 02:30:47,883
I'm going to pace.

4031
02:30:48,183 --> 02:30:48,866
Like the pace.

4032
02:30:48,866 --> 02:30:49,950
Look at pace.

4033
02:30:52,017 --> 02:30:54,384
For you tapping.

4034
02:30:54,384 --> 02:30:55,134
Yeah, OK.

4035
02:30:55,134 --> 02:30:58,568
Again, your way again your way.

4036
02:30:58,584 --> 02:31:00,034
No, no. OK, fine.

4037
02:31:00,034 --> 02:31:01,951
I like when you're in my way.

4038
02:31:02,668 --> 02:31:04,268
And yet you don't like ends here.

4039
02:31:04,268 --> 02:31:05,335
Interesting.

4040
02:31:06,235 --> 02:31:08,886
Oh, you still on this canister?

4041
02:31:08,886 --> 02:31:10,519
So I didn't know it was like this.

4042
02:31:10,519 --> 02:31:12,219
Stewart, I'm so sorry.

4043
02:31:12,219 --> 02:31:13,020
Shut up.

4044
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:15,437
Anyways, what are we doing with this car?

4045
02:31:16,003 --> 02:31:18,087
Wait, where it's Albion?

4046
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:21,037
Where? Where? Hello. With the pussy.

4047
02:31:22,104 --> 02:31:23,438
OK, like.

4048
02:31:23,438 --> 02:31:25,505
I'm literally right behind you.
You're a fucking idiot.

4049
02:31:25,505 --> 02:31:26,188
I can't.

4050
02:31:26,188 --> 02:31:27,272
I'm stuck

4051
02:31:29,855 --> 02:31:30,939
I'm stuck.

4052
02:31:32,672 --> 02:31:33,489
I'm stuck.

4053
02:31:33,489 --> 02:31:35,589
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

4054
02:31:35,589 --> 02:31:36,756
Oh, my God.

4055
02:31:36,756 --> 02:31:37,806
I couldn't move.

4056
02:31:37,806 --> 02:31:40,740
The gas canister cocks me.

4057
02:31:41,374 --> 02:31:41,724
Oh, you're right.

4058
02:31:41,724 --> 02:31:43,490
There's a cat on.

4059
02:31:43,490 --> 02:31:45,107
His smug face.

4060
02:31:45,107 --> 02:31:47,074
Is he alive?

4061
02:31:47,074 --> 02:31:49,775
Yes, he's alive. He's not believes.

4062
02:31:49,808 --> 02:31:52,108
He's not blinking. Oh, he was here.

4063
02:31:52,775 --> 02:31:55,209
Yeah, he's alive. Yeah. All right.

4064
02:31:55,209 --> 02:31:57,159
He took my gas canister.

4065
02:31:57,159 --> 02:31:57,676
I did.

4066
02:31:57,676 --> 02:32:01,076
I'm assuming
we need it for the wait, wait.

4067
02:32:01,076 --> 02:32:01,893
What was that.

4068
02:32:01,893 --> 02:32:02,910
Huh? Was what?

4069
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:06,244
It was like shoot horseshoe
throwing or something.

4070
02:32:06,877 --> 02:32:07,744
All we could.

4071
02:32:07,744 --> 02:32:09,361
All we could play a mini game.

4072
02:32:09,361 --> 02:32:10,561
All right, all right.

4073
02:32:11,278 --> 02:32:11,944
You are getting.

4074
02:32:11,944 --> 02:32:13,795
Your ass beat.

4075
02:32:14,045 --> 02:32:16,495
Oh, I don't know about that.

4076
02:32:18,362 --> 02:32:19,195
Fuck.

4077
02:32:19,195 --> 02:32:20,879
Oh, wait. I did get. It. That

4078
02:32:23,129 --> 02:32:23,696
night.

4079
02:32:23,696 --> 02:32:24,996
What's all.

4080
02:32:24,996 --> 02:32:28,297
Dude, you're gonna get your ass
manhandled by this.

4081
02:32:28,297 --> 02:32:30,447
This cowboy right here.

4082
02:32:30,447 --> 02:32:31,981
You ain't ready, son.

4083
02:32:31,981 --> 02:32:33,114
Oh, look at that.

4084
02:32:33,114 --> 02:32:33,714
Look at that.

4085
02:32:33,714 --> 02:32:35,198
Perfect. Five, four, five.

4086
02:32:35,198 --> 02:32:36,998
I see you do that.

4087
02:32:37,798 --> 02:32:38,281
Go ahead.

4088
02:32:38,281 --> 02:32:39,665

What the fuck?

4097
02:33:09,669 --> 02:33:10,869
I'm the king.

4098
02:33:10,869 --> 02:33:12,303
Why you lost?

4099
02:33:12,303 --> 02:33:13,920

4100
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:14,387
Well,

I want to open my mouth on this one.

4110
02:33:43,557 --> 02:33:45,758
No, not so much.

4111
02:33:46,358 --> 02:33:48,275
Oh, you mix the walls, the new house.

Isn't it? It was the same one.

02:34:05,644 --> 02:34:07,977
It's easy to get confused.

02:34:08,427 --> 02:34:10,144
All right, I'm walking.

4122
02:34:10,144 --> 02:34:10,678
See this?

4123
02:34:10,678 --> 02:34:11,545
That's the same house.

4124
02:34:11,545 --> 02:34:13,295

You know you can't rush.

4142
02:34:54,567 --> 02:34:56,517
You can't rush an old man like this.

4143
02:34:56,517 --> 02:34:57,001
Yeah.

4144
02:34:59,618 --> 02:34:59,968

02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:02,335

Hold you.

4150
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:14,037
You are so slow.

4151
02:35:17,737 --> 02:35:19,237
Vincent, come over here and help me.

4152
02:35:19,237 --> 02:35:20,738
Up, ok? OK.

4153
02:35:20,738 --> 02:35:21,804
I think you need.

4154
02:35:21,804 --> 02:35:24,755
I need so much help. You're so needy.

4155
02:35:24,755 --> 02:35:25,355
I need.

4156
02:35:25,355 --> 02:35:26,972
Why can't you do it by yourself?

4157
02:35:26,972 --> 02:35:29,305
I'm weak. I need you.

4158
02:35:29,305 --> 02:35:31,122
This car is a piece of junk.

4159
02:35:31,122 --> 02:35:31,556
What do you. Mean?

4160
02:35:31,556 --> 02:35:32,289
It's actually, it's pretty.

4161
02:35:32,289 --> 02:35:34,589
Cool as like a hat and everything.

4162
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:37,173
Doesn't look like.

4163
02:35:37,173 --> 02:35:39,307
It's even missing.
It doesn't have a wheel.

4164
02:35:39,607 --> 02:35:41,791
I'm sure there's a spare around here
somewhere.

4165
02:35:41,791 --> 02:35:43,857
I think cars can drive on free wheels.

4166
02:35:44,258 --> 02:35:46,108
It's not like we have a choice.

4167
02:35:46,108 --> 02:35:47,558
Sure, but running on foot.

4168
02:35:47,558 --> 02:35:50,175
Let's fix it up and we'll be out of here
in no time, right?

4169
02:35:50,608 --> 02:35:53,009
Do these old people are, like,
taking forever

02:35:53,225 --> 02:35:55,259
because we've been fucking around for,
like, the past?

4171
02:35:55,259 --> 02:35:58,276
Well, you can't catch horse horses.

4172
02:35:58,293 --> 02:35:59,976
Horse. Horse.

4173
02:35:59,976 --> 02:36:03,177
Cause you can't catch horses.

4174
02:36:03,777 --> 02:36:05,944
Why do you say it like that?

4175
02:36:06,211 --> 02:36:07,144
Horses?

4176
02:36:07,144 --> 02:36:08,911
Why do you say it like that?

4177
02:36:08,911 --> 02:36:10,895
Yeah. Horses. Yeah. Why you police?

Walk the walk.

You know that.

4184
02:36:26,363 --> 02:36:27,630
Like, puffer fish farm.

4185
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:29,697
We could use this new tire.

4186
02:36:29,847 --> 02:36:32,014
Stone, it sounds like. Yes, it does.

4187
02:36:32,014 --> 02:36:33,998

02:36:51,184 --> 02:36:53,217
Somebody play it right now.

You're so fucking funny.

02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:03,577
No, why would I, why would I leave.

4223

The wrench up there?

4224
02:38:04,594 --> 02:38:07,378

Without the wrench.

I'll wait for you.

4227
02:38:11,978 --> 02:38:13,595
I'll wait for you here.

4228
02:38:13,962 --> 02:38:15,029
I need to check something.

4229
02:38:15,029 --> 02:38:15,479
Oh, shit.

4230
02:38:15,479 --> 02:38:17,612
Oh, my God. Yeah,

4231
02:38:18,279 --> 02:38:21,179
Oh, it doesn't sound like that shot
solid, but.

4232
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:22,796
Yes, it does. What do you think?

4233
02:38:22,796 --> 02:38:24,597
It sounds like they make the noise
right now.

4234
02:38:24,597 --> 02:38:27,547
Oh. That's not that at all.

4235
02:38:28,147 --> 02:38:31,614
So what kind of porn are you watching?

4236
02:38:31,864 --> 02:38:32,781
That's what

4237
02:38:33,998 --> 02:38:36,132

Hello.

02:38:38,515 --> 02:38:40,015
OK, where's the tire, man?

4241
02:38:40,015 --> 02:38:42,149
Show me the fucking site.

4242
02:38:42,149 --> 02:38:44,933
I dropped it right here.

4243
02:38:44,933 --> 02:38:46,866
Where are you?

4244
02:38:46,866 --> 02:38:48,333
Right here. Inside, baby.

4245
02:38:48,333 --> 02:38:50,367
Put it in the side. The inside the socket.

4246
02:38:50,367 --> 02:38:53,584
I put it inside. OK, good. Man.

4247
02:38:53,851 --> 02:38:55,651
Good job. Good job.

4248
02:38:55,718 --> 02:38:57,551
Now it's inside.

4249
02:38:57,551 --> 02:38:58,835
OK. Ok.

4250
02:38:58,835 --> 02:39:00,902
Now we just need to screw in the starts.

4251
02:39:00,902 --> 02:39:01,618
And we're screwed.

4252
02:39:01,618 --> 02:39:04,802
And and now I. Oh, yeah.

4253
02:39:04,869 --> 02:39:09,236
Front thingy and I grab the gasoline.

4254
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:10,320
Juice.

4255
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:13,020
Yeah, all my sounds are off. They are.

4256
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:15,204
There are at least OK.

4257
02:39:15,204 --> 02:39:18,571
And then I go hit something
and then I keep.

4258
02:39:18,604 --> 02:39:20,971
The support. And then I open.

4259
02:39:20,971 --> 02:39:22,038
What are you saying?

4260
02:39:22,038 --> 02:39:23,588
What are you saying? Right now.
It's like the.

4261
02:39:23,588 --> 02:39:24,872
Best way is out of the. Boy.

4262
02:39:24,872 --> 02:39:27,689
The battery is out to
juice. And to take the gas.

4263
02:39:29,672 --> 02:39:31,556
And then I open.

4264
02:39:31,556 --> 02:39:32,773
And go back in the house.

4265
02:39:32,773 --> 02:39:35,423
You watch TV, you continue the job.

Oh, no. Oh, no,

It's not going to work.

What do you mean, it's not going to repair
it? No.

He's gone.

4375
02:43:34,973 --> 02:43:36,757
It's a Rubik's cube.

4376
02:43:36,757 --> 02:43:38,941
Why would he be seraphin sku?

4377
02:43:39,124 --> 02:43:40,924

02:43:41,008 --> 02:43:42,875
Oh, shit. Take cover.

02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:07,503

02:45:07,503 --> 02:45:08,520

OK. OK.

And I need to reload.

4426
02:45:21,555 --> 02:45:23,589
Holy shit. Reloading.

Oh, God.

02:45:29,789 --> 02:45:31,806
You know that.

4431
02:45:31,806 --> 02:45:33,840
That's ok.

4432
02:45:34,023 --> 02:45:35,774
Wow. Oh, my God.

Yo, yo, I'm sick.

4437
02:45:46,292 --> 02:45:47,525
What the fuck?

4438
02:45:47,525 --> 02:45:49,409
I can't even see my crosshair. See,

4439
02:45:49,409 --> 02:45:51,926
They call me the pile driver.

4440
02:45:51,959 --> 02:45:53,976
I guess at this woman.

4441
02:45:54,610 --> 02:45:56,010
Oh, shit.

From them in a fucking. Boat?

4531
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:11,287
We're using horns well,
the easiest targets in the world.

4532
02:49:11,287 --> 02:49:15,604
Yeah, well, I feel they could

Probably a shark. Leo.

4551
02:49:48,909 --> 02:49:50,409
I can't believe you didn't crash.

4552
02:49:50,409 --> 02:49:51,309
I didn't believe in you.

4553
02:49:51,309 --> 02:49:53,576
No, don't go that way. Don't go.
Oh, you know, I'm supposed to.

4554

Too much, too much. Too cold.

Oh, you know what?

02:50:08,195 --> 02:50:09,895
We could have. Oh, no, it's ok.

4562
02:50:09,895 --> 02:50:10,829
It didn't hurt that much.

4563
02:50:10,829 --> 02:50:13,179
Yeah, this is nice. OK.

4564
02:50:13,179 --> 02:50:13,529

02:51:59,644 --> 02:52:02,228
Yeah, yeah, right, right, right, right.

4618
02:52:02,228 --> 02:52:03,895
Oh, my God. That's always.

4619
02:52:03,895 --> 02:52:04,378
That's left.

4620
02:52:04,378 --> 02:52:05,078
That's left.

4621
02:52:05,078 --> 02:52:06,895
That's rotten. No. Oh, no, we're dead.

4622
02:52:06,895 --> 02:52:07,445
We're dead.

4623
02:52:07,445 --> 02:52:08,429
Oh, no, we're fine.

4624
02:52:08,429 --> 02:52:10,196
Oh, it's not winnable.

4625
02:52:10,196 --> 02:52:12,596
Winnable and winnable. It's winnable.

4626
02:52:12,746 --> 02:52:14,046
It's winnable.

4627
02:52:14,046 --> 02:52:14,429
I know.

4628
02:52:14,429 --> 02:52:16,346
So what about you are so bad.

4629
02:52:16,346 --> 02:52:17,247
So bad.

4630
02:52:17,247 --> 02:52:18,180
It's not winnable.

4631
02:52:18,180 --> 02:52:20,730
It's not. Well, all I do, dude.

4632
02:52:21,597 --> 02:52:23,881
How do how.

4633
02:52:25,448 --> 02:52:27,365
This is so hard to control I want to see.

4634
02:52:27,365 --> 02:52:29,915
I want to see you. Guys do this shit
acting like it's.

4635
02:52:29,915 --> 02:52:31,265
So easy left there.

4636
02:52:31,265 --> 02:52:34,016
OK, ok. OK.

4637
02:52:34,749 --> 02:52:38,249
OK. Gently, gently down the stream, right?

4638
02:52:38,316 --> 02:52:39,000
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

4639
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,417
OK, but why the side that? Well,
this side.

4640
02:52:42,417 --> 02:52:42,833
That's good.

4641
02:52:42,833 --> 02:52:43,784
I got it. I got it.

4642
02:52:43,784 --> 02:52:45,834
Got bad. OK, that's fine.

4643
02:52:45,834 --> 02:52:47,467
That's fine. Fine. Left, left on the left.

4644
02:52:47,467 --> 02:52:51,635
See, I would like to see the opening stuff
sliding, the sliding, complicated.

4645
02:52:51,635 --> 02:52:54,752
Lubricated, lubrication
lubricating this lubricant.

4646
02:52:54,868 --> 02:52:56,419
Do you not know what lubricating is?

4647
02:52:56,419 --> 02:52:59,419
Are you oh, god.

4648
02:52:59,736 --> 02:53:01,119
Gently, gently, gently.

4649
02:53:01,119 --> 02:53:01,919
OK, right.

4650
02:53:01,919 --> 02:53:04,403
Right. Yeah, you got it.
You're under control.

4651
02:53:04,403 --> 02:53:06,570
I got it. Got it. Nice.

4652
02:53:06,570 --> 02:53:08,337
OK, a little bit more a little bit more.

4653
02:53:08,337 --> 02:53:10,187
Just the right little love top.

4654
02:53:10,187 --> 02:53:10,887
Little left up.

4655
02:53:10,887 --> 02:53:13,171
OK, nice. OK.

Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.

Uh huh.

4658
02:53:17,488 --> 02:53:19,555
Oh, I think we're through the worst of it.

02:53:19,555 --> 02:53:21,656
Uh huh. The is just uh huh.

It's just a smooth ride. Is it.

4661
02:53:23,222 --> 02:53:25,539
I think you're supposed to see this
straight ahead.

4662
02:53:25,589 --> 02:53:27,090
What is this?

4663
02:53:27,090 --> 02:53:29,107
It's just a smooth ride behind ass

4664
02:53:30,957 --> 02:53:32,424

Just better.

Just better.

4693
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:42,784
We're just better.

4694
02:54:42,784 --> 02:54:45,117
OK? No, we're not. No, we're not.

4695
02:54:45,667 --> 02:54:47,784

02:55:16,922 --> 02:55:18,422
Hold it.

02:55:19,589 --> 02:55:21,306
Now, why are you doing this up?

4708
02:55:21,306 --> 02:55:22,406
What are you doing?

4709
02:55:24,006 --> 02:55:24,873
Grab my hand.

4710
02:55:24,873 --> 02:55:25,990
Grab my fucking hand.

4711
02:55:25,990 --> 02:55:27,473
You grab it

4712
02:55:29,673 --> 02:55:30,807
come on, guys.

4713
02:55:30,990 --> 02:55:32,557
I'm trying. I'm trying so hard.

4714
02:55:32,557 --> 02:55:34,307
I'm trying my hand.

4715
02:55:34,307 --> 02:55:37,775
I'm trying to reach out, reach out,
reach out

4716
02:55:37,975 --> 02:55:41,492
reach out. Mysta.

4717
02:55:44,576 --> 02:55:46,059
I got you, man.

4718
02:55:46,059 --> 02:55:47,376
I got you,

4719
02:55:48,243 --> 02:55:50,676
I got you

4720
02:55:50,676 --> 02:55:51,843
here, OK?

4721
02:55:51,843 --> 02:55:53,643
I never betray.

4722
02:55:53,643 --> 02:55:53,977
Let's get.

4723
02:55:53,977 --> 02:55:57,477
Out cutesy pie now,

4724
02:55:59,544 --> 02:56:01,228
that was a test.

4725
02:56:01,261 --> 02:56:03,395
You know, when you're at the peak of,
like,

4726
02:56:03,628 --> 02:56:07,012
death, you show your true colours
and you know what?

4727
02:56:07,029 --> 02:56:08,729
You you called for my name.

4728
02:56:08,729 --> 02:56:10,179
What if I.

4729
02:56:10,863 --> 02:56:11,879
Yeah.

4730
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:13,530
Oh, my God.

4731
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:17,814
You're going to make. Me so now.

4732
02:56:19,264 --> 02:56:23,014
I'm going to go to Dairy Queen after this
and buy a large blizzard because of you.

4733
02:56:23,731 --> 02:56:25,648
A large blizzard.

4734
02:56:25,648 --> 02:56:28,165
Blizzard it's an ice cream.

4735
02:56:28,165 --> 02:56:30,865
I need. I need. I need some ghost Tranter.

4736
02:56:30,999 --> 02:56:33,449
You know, that's
when I was craving ice cream, too.

4737
02:56:33,849 --> 02:56:35,216
Oh, are. You. Are you Kurt?

4738
02:56:35,216 --> 02:56:37,416
What is he? Once
you want to get some ice cream together.

4739
02:56:37,416 --> 02:56:39,333
I want to get creamed.
You know that cream can.

4740
02:56:40,283 --> 02:56:41,367
Without them.

4741
02:56:44,167 --> 02:56:45,667
So give you a little something, a little.

4742
02:56:45,667 --> 02:56:48,184
Drizzled, give you a little drizzle
on top of that till.

4743
02:56:48,568 --> 02:56:50,018
Your favourite ice cream never.

4744
02:56:50,018 --> 02:56:52,685
Told me. Leo, I love coffee.

4745
02:56:52,685 --> 02:56:54,069
What is your strawberry with Harvey.

4746
02:56:54,069 --> 02:56:56,319
And mint chocolate chip. Sauce?

4747
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:58,853
OK, you know what? Do you like it?

4748
02:56:59,336 --> 02:57:00,453
Yeah, what you like?

4749
02:57:00,453 --> 02:57:02,486
And which chocolate? Vanilla, strawberry.

4750
02:57:02,670 --> 02:57:03,937
You're so basic.

4751
02:57:03,937 --> 02:57:06,454
You're so basic.

4752
02:57:06,454 --> 02:57:09,004
Oh, my God. What's what else?

4753
02:57:09,004 --> 02:57:10,288
How the hell did you pull that off?

4754
02:57:10,288 --> 02:57:13,388
Chocolate sauce sprinkles. OK,

4755
02:57:13,388 --> 02:57:14,755
so what happened?

4756
02:57:15,005 --> 02:57:17,155
Everything was going our way.

4757
02:57:17,155 --> 02:57:18,755
We even had a buyer.

4758
02:57:18,755 --> 02:57:20,006
But that greedy fuck a.

4759
02:57:20,006 --> 02:57:22,389
Flake, chocolate flake.

4760
02:57:22,389 --> 02:57:24,690
What the fuck is a chocolate flake?

4761
02:57:24,690 --> 02:57:26,857
It's like a chocolate bar
that you put on top of ice cream.

4762
02:57:27,123 --> 02:57:29,557
That's flaky. Oh.

4763
02:57:31,140 --> 02:57:32,407
You know

4764
02:57:32,941 --> 02:57:34,141
why you need.

4765
02:57:34,141 --> 02:57:35,691
Do you not like coffee? Ice cream?

4766
02:57:35,691 --> 02:57:37,808
You only coffee? I don't. Like coffee.

4767
02:57:37,808 --> 02:57:40,225
You only coffee
flavour or coffee flavour, huh?

4768
02:57:40,508 --> 02:57:43,109
No coffee. Cake. Same thing.

4769
02:57:43,109 --> 02:57:46,593
No coffee cake.

4770
02:57:46,593 --> 02:57:48,460
No coffee is gross.

4771
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:49,926
So what is this like? Gross.

4772
02:57:49,926 --> 02:57:50,910
You are so gross.

4773
02:57:50,910 --> 02:57:52,293
Oh, my God.

4774
02:57:53,427 --> 02:57:54,210
John Wick.

4775
02:57:54,210 --> 02:57:55,577
Oh, dude, I love that.

4776
02:57:55,577 --> 02:57:57,327
This is actually,
like, the first. Star scene there.

4777
02:57:57,327 --> 02:57:58,344
Yeah, like, we're far.

4778
02:57:58,344 --> 02:57:58,828
Yeah, yeah.

4779
02:57:58,828 --> 02:58:00,278
The car shop

4780
02:58:04,995 --> 02:58:07,029
oh, we're having a flashback right now.

4781
02:58:07,045 --> 02:58:08,679
Looks about right.

4782
02:58:09,929 --> 02:58:10,929
Chatter is not based.

4783
02:58:10,929 --> 02:58:13,646
Shut up. Shop shuttle is based.
Chocolate ice cream.

4784
02:58:13,646 --> 02:58:14,613
I can agree with that.

4785
02:58:14,613 --> 02:58:16,864
You know what? Being your favourite, I'm
a little weird.

4786
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:19,264
Vanilla is not my favourite.

4787
02:58:19,264 --> 02:58:20,431
You say that's my favourite.

4788
02:58:20,431 --> 02:58:21,698
You said chocolate, vanilla?

4789
02:58:21,698 --> 02:58:24,148
Strawberry. Yes.

4790
02:58:24,148 --> 02:58:26,365
All the fucking Neapolitan flavours. Yeah.

4791
02:58:26,398 --> 02:58:28,949
And you said sprinkles. Oh, my God.

4792
02:58:28,949 --> 02:58:30,999
What do you think? Gold gone

4793
02:58:35,316 --> 02:58:35,800
oh, every.

4794
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:36,666
That. I saw it.

4795
02:58:36,666 --> 02:58:39,717
Wait, this is how he dies.

4796
02:58:40,317 --> 02:58:42,084
I know this is not his product, is it?

4797
02:58:42,084 --> 02:58:44,434
Pleasure doing business with you guys.

4798
02:58:44,434 --> 02:58:45,518
You two

4799
02:58:48,968 --> 02:58:50,035
give me the case.

4800
02:58:50,035 --> 02:58:51,568
What the fuck are you doing?

4801
02:58:51,568 --> 02:58:54,335
Give me the fucking case, Leo.

4802
02:58:54,335 --> 02:58:57,336
Hand it over now.

4803
02:58:57,686 --> 02:58:59,770
Jemma, what the fuck is wrong
when I'm wrong?

4804
02:59:00,370 --> 02:59:02,253
It's nothing personal.

4805
02:59:02,253 --> 02:59:03,337
It's just. Business.

4806
02:59:03,337 --> 02:59:05,337
What the fuck? Charmer.

4807
02:59:06,154 --> 02:59:08,587
Jealous? Oh,

4808
02:59:10,138 --> 02:59:12,155
he wasted all those bullets. Easy
to reload.

4809
02:59:12,155 --> 02:59:13,105
Quickly back

4810
02:59:14,688 --> 02:59:16,038
it's out of there.

4811
02:59:16,772 --> 02:59:19,956
Unless they all know he's out.

4812
02:59:20,789 --> 02:59:23,973
Do you think that guy was Vincent's
brother?

4813
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:25,923
The whole time? Next thing.

4814
02:59:25,923 --> 02:59:28,357
I know. As I remember,
he said that his brother died.

4815
02:59:28,557 --> 02:59:29,907
I don't. Think Salisbury.

4816
02:59:29,907 --> 02:59:32,191
There's no way this is related,
is it? Trust me.

4817
02:59:32,524 --> 02:59:34,758
All we know,
he said Harvey killed his brother Ross.

4818
02:59:34,774 --> 02:59:37,408
He probably came across, right?
I might be him.

4819
02:59:37,508 --> 02:59:39,242
Damn. You're your detective for a.

4820
02:59:39,242 --> 02:59:40,575
Reason, bro. Look.

4821
02:59:42,275 --> 02:59:44,259
Actual wrinkles, folds in your brains.

4822
02:59:44,259 --> 02:59:44,726
This thing.

4823
02:59:44,726 --> 02:59:47,260
You know, one of these guys way,
you know for sure.

4824
02:59:48,843 --> 02:59:53,277
So I want to kiss your beard.

4825
02:59:54,394 --> 02:59:55,527
Let's go after him.

4826
02:59:55,527 --> 02:59:58,628
I kiss your forehead,
and we'll lick your sideburn.

4827
03:00:00,128 --> 03:00:01,478
You just have to take it too far, man.

4828
03:00:01,478 --> 03:00:04,112
You really want to take Harvey down?
You have to take it too far.

4829
03:00:04,379 --> 03:00:06,662
What do you mean, take it to you for me?
Would you touch my beard.

4830
03:00:06,662 --> 03:00:07,779
With or without?

4831
03:00:07,779 --> 03:00:10,196
It's like sacred territory.
That is sacred territory.

4832
03:00:10,196 --> 03:00:11,880
That's equivalent to my pubic hair.

4833
03:00:11,880 --> 03:00:13,763
And you wanna say you want to kiss it?

4834
03:00:13,763 --> 03:00:14,430
No, it's not.

4835
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:16,597
You're saying you taking it too far,
and you say, I'm

4836
03:00:19,164 --> 03:00:22,231
OK anyways.

4837
03:00:22,448 --> 03:00:23,215
All right,

4838
03:00:24,215 --> 03:00:26,932
where can we find this guy?

4839
03:00:27,015 --> 03:00:29,432
Oh. Going to be easy to find anyone.

4840
03:00:29,432 --> 03:00:31,599
I'm easy to find. Family. Safe anyways.

4841
03:00:32,282 --> 03:00:32,699
Of course.

4842
03:00:34,799 --> 03:00:35,583
Let's go.

4843
03:00:35,850 --> 03:00:37,983
I'm saying I took it.

4844
03:00:38,017 --> 03:00:40,050
You father. What the hell.

4845
03:00:41,017 --> 03:00:41,317
Happened?

4846
03:00:41,317 --> 03:00:43,317
What? Don't listen to yourself, man.

4847
03:00:43,317 --> 03:00:46,418
Listen,
what about the words that, like you.

4848
03:00:46,568 --> 03:00:49,502
Spew out of my mouth of your mouth
at your mouth?

4849
03:00:50,335 --> 03:00:51,902
Son, I don't listen to it.

4850
03:00:51,902 --> 03:00:52,769
Oh, is that your son?

4851
03:00:52,769 --> 03:00:54,969
My mouth I'm not speaking.

4852
03:00:54,969 --> 03:00:57,836
He looks like he looks like Gregory.

4853
03:00:57,836 --> 03:01:00,536
That's not my son, Alex.

4854
03:01:01,903 --> 03:01:03,387
I looks like a little bitch.

4855
03:01:03,387 --> 03:01:04,170
That's your wife.

4856
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:05,570
Hey, my son. That's your wife.

4857
03:01:05,570 --> 03:01:07,154
That's her son.

4858
03:01:08,037 --> 03:01:10,504
He said, Mom, that's not my kid.

4859
03:01:10,588 --> 03:01:11,738
Is it? Honey.

4860
03:01:12,088 --> 03:01:14,155
My kid has bad. Then that's wrong.

4861
03:01:14,155 --> 03:01:16,055
What are you talking about?

4862
03:01:16,055 --> 03:01:17,672
That's not my son.

4863
03:01:20,806 --> 03:01:22,756
Ow, ow.

4864
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:25,207
Ow, ow.

4865
03:01:26,423 --> 03:01:28,407
Ow. Shit.

4866
03:01:28,407 --> 03:01:29,490
Alex.

4867
03:01:29,490 --> 03:01:30,507
Alex,

4868
03:01:33,308 --> 03:01:35,041
oh. Dude.

4869
03:01:35,041 --> 03:01:37,208
He reminds me of Gregory.

4870
03:01:37,208 --> 03:01:40,109
Leo only ask you something personal.

4871
03:01:41,192 --> 03:01:42,026
Yeah, sure.

4872
03:01:42,026 --> 03:01:43,742
Gregory from Fanatic.

4873
03:01:43,742 --> 03:01:44,526
How do you.

4874
03:01:44,526 --> 03:01:45,026
Know the one?

4875
03:01:45,026 --> 03:01:47,460
The pledge
to stay together in this line of work.

4876
03:01:47,710 --> 03:01:49,927
You heard of a moment now, kid?

4877
03:01:49,927 --> 03:01:52,110
We've always been together the whole.

4878
03:01:52,110 --> 03:01:54,294
Well, have you all
we know you don't play poor games, right?

4879
03:01:54,361 --> 03:01:55,194
I know myself.

4880
03:01:55,194 --> 03:01:57,294
I've played some horror games.

4881
03:01:57,511 --> 03:01:59,245
Yeah, I was.

4882
03:01:59,378 --> 03:02:01,828
Wait for you to play well, last we met.

4883
03:02:01,828 --> 03:02:04,079
That awful. Oh, yeah. I think Fletch.

4884
03:02:05,129 --> 03:02:05,912
You could say that.

4885
03:02:05,912 --> 03:02:07,629
Yeah, that's going to be, like, next week,
I think.

4886
03:02:07,629 --> 03:02:09,896
Actually. I'm sorry to hear that.

4887
03:02:11,180 --> 03:02:11,846
I know.

4888
03:02:11,846 --> 03:02:14,197
I need to get to 500 k.
I bet I'm so close.

4889
03:02:14,213 --> 03:02:15,780
You're so close. Yeah.

4890
03:02:15,780 --> 03:02:17,064
They technique.

4891
03:02:17,064 --> 03:02:20,331
I was fortunate enough to have Linda.

4892
03:02:20,331 --> 03:02:22,565
Linda, these nice.

4893
03:02:22,565 --> 03:02:24,665
That this even
though sense. Away together.

4894
03:02:25,798 --> 03:02:27,099
That doesn't even make sense.

4895
03:02:27,099 --> 03:02:28,599
It wasn't even me.

4896
03:02:28,949 --> 03:02:31,116
And I'm laughing with you. I'm laughing.

4897
03:02:31,116 --> 03:02:33,616
See, why am I laughing at it?

4898
03:02:33,699 --> 03:02:36,367
Well, well,
you sound so disappointed, though.

4899
03:02:37,683 --> 03:02:38,533
That's that's.

4900
03:02:38,533 --> 03:02:39,067
Too many.

4901
03:02:39,067 --> 03:02:43,067
These nuts jokes used on me like that.

4902
03:02:43,317 --> 03:02:43,684
They're

4903
03:02:48,235 --> 03:02:48,452
I've.

4904
03:02:48,452 --> 03:02:50,068
Never thought I you know, I've.

4905
03:02:50,068 --> 03:02:53,619
Never thought I could be physically
exhausted from colliding with somebody.

4906
03:02:53,619 --> 03:02:57,036
You're, like, hitting the world record,
and I'm.

4907
03:02:57,103 --> 03:02:58,653
I'm impressed.

4908
03:02:58,653 --> 03:02:59,753
I'm impressed.

4909
03:02:59,753 --> 03:03:02,037
That's all them alongside. Who?

4910
03:03:03,237 --> 03:03:05,337
Marlon Dick in your mouth.

4911
03:03:06,321 --> 03:03:06,854
Film.

4912
03:03:07,388 --> 03:03:10,621
It's a woman and a boy about this

4913
03:03:10,855 --> 03:03:11,205
this.

4914
03:03:11,938 --> 03:03:14,939
They had to move while I was inside.

4915
03:03:17,072 --> 03:03:18,872
I'm sure we'll find them.

4916
03:03:20,456 --> 03:03:21,640
Huh? Well, it's.

4917
03:03:21,640 --> 03:03:22,990
Rough out here. Well.

4918
03:03:22,990 --> 03:03:24,207
You got that right.

4919
03:03:24,207 --> 03:03:24,690
Well, I.

4920
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:27,390
Never
actually set foot in a place like that.

4921
03:03:27,390 --> 03:03:30,324
Thank you guys for coming to today's club.

4922
03:03:31,508 --> 03:03:34,108
I thank you for coming to this club.

4923
03:03:34,625 --> 03:03:35,308
I'll see you.

4924
03:03:35,308 --> 03:03:37,108
I'll see you tomorrow. All right.

4925
03:03:37,108 --> 03:03:39,092
See you guys tomorrow.

4926
03:03:44,726 --> 03:03:46,676
OK? I'm just kidding.

4927
03:03:46,676 --> 03:03:49,777
Hello. Hi.

4928
03:03:50,077 --> 03:03:52,344
I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.

4929
03:03:52,861 --> 03:03:55,528
So my goddamn husband.

4930
03:03:55,828 --> 03:03:57,845
Oh, he better be back soon.

4931
03:03:57,845 --> 03:03:59,345
Oh, I think this is your wife.

4932
03:03:59,345 --> 03:04:00,362
That's not my wife.

4933
03:04:00,362 --> 03:04:04,129
We saw my wife on the screen knowing me.

4934
03:04:04,379 --> 03:04:06,729
Yeah, she's not.
This lady's not. Pregnant.

4935
03:04:07,179 --> 03:04:07,779
Oh, my God.

4936
03:04:07,779 --> 03:04:09,246
How can we bother these people?

4937
03:04:09,246 --> 03:04:12,063
If you see him, they're grilling barbecue.

4938
03:04:12,263 --> 03:04:13,463
I want barbecue.

4939
03:04:13,463 --> 03:04:14,197
I want barbecue.

4940
03:04:14,197 --> 03:04:16,264
All had a barbecue and so many years.

4941
03:04:16,264 --> 03:04:18,948
What I'm not.

4942
03:04:18,998 --> 03:04:20,164
Talk to you, lady.

4943
03:04:20,164 --> 03:04:20,548
What's up?

4944
03:04:20,548 --> 03:04:21,598
You look upset.

4945
03:04:21,598 --> 03:04:22,748
Oh, I am.

4946
03:04:22,748 --> 03:04:24,565
I'm waiting for my goddamn husband.

4947
03:04:24,565 --> 03:04:26,615
I'm going to beat his ass.

4948
03:04:26,615 --> 03:04:27,849
Yeah, that's you.

4949
03:04:27,849 --> 03:04:29,732
Have I seen him? What's he do?

4950
03:04:30,899 --> 03:04:31,533
So why do.

4951
03:04:31,533 --> 03:04:33,033
I look at this?

4952
03:04:33,633 --> 03:04:37,650
He's been cheating on me,
and nobody cheats on Martha Sansa.

4953
03:04:37,884 --> 03:04:40,567
For what they. Censor.

4954
03:04:40,567 --> 03:04:41,767
What are we censoring, boy?

4955
03:04:41,767 --> 03:04:44,401
Why are we fuckery censoring, huh?

4956
03:04:44,401 --> 03:04:45,985
Let me get the sense already.

4957
03:04:45,985 --> 03:04:46,435
I did.

4958
03:04:46,435 --> 03:04:47,251
I can't even.

4959
03:04:47,251 --> 03:04:50,185
What's going to be shown cock

4960
03:04:50,619 --> 03:04:52,619
again or ass we've seen already

4961
03:04:54,419 --> 03:04:57,236
oh, hey, you want to ride on this with me?

4962
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:59,220
I don't think we can.

4963
03:04:59,220 --> 03:04:59,487
Oh, yeah.

4964
03:04:59,487 --> 03:05:02,970
We can't see on television. Cute

4965
03:05:03,070 --> 03:05:05,087
I just look at

4966
03:05:06,054 --> 03:05:06,754
baited me.

4967
03:05:06,754 --> 03:05:09,805
I thought we could have, you know, had a
little had a little moments on the swings.

4968
03:05:11,855 --> 03:05:12,655
I I'm not a swinger.

4969
03:05:12,655 --> 03:05:14,789
Hey, there. Whoa.

4970
03:05:14,789 --> 03:05:16,656
What the hell happened to this car?

4971
03:05:16,656 --> 03:05:18,456
Oh. Beats me.

4972
03:05:18,456 --> 03:05:21,206
Just OK. I don't care anymore.

4973
03:05:21,206 --> 03:05:22,556
Wow. Oh,

4974
03:05:23,673 --> 03:05:24,623
he bored me.

4975
03:05:24,623 --> 03:05:27,424
He got me bored, man.
Oh, I'll. Talk to you instead.

4976
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:28,974
You look like you know you do.

4977
03:05:28,974 --> 03:05:32,074
You just grab the hammer
and start going to work at their place.

4978
03:05:33,375 --> 03:05:34,975
I might have a job for you.

4979
03:05:34,975 --> 03:05:36,175
Interesting.

4980
03:05:38,125 --> 03:05:39,175
What job?

4981
03:05:39,175 --> 03:05:40,226
What are we talking about?

4982
03:05:40,226 --> 03:05:42,959
Oh, he wants me to join him. Oh, my God.

4983
03:05:43,559 --> 03:05:45,276
That's your son. It strange.

4984
03:05:45,276 --> 03:05:46,893
That's not my son.

4985
03:05:47,093 --> 03:05:48,627
Well, let's check it out, ok?

4986
03:05:48,627 --> 03:05:50,427
Maybe you are allergic to cash.

4987
03:05:50,427 --> 03:05:52,227
All right, fine. I'll go see my kid.

4988
03:05:52,227 --> 03:05:54,244
Yeah, let's go look for.
Look for your family.

4989
03:05:54,244 --> 03:05:55,378
You got to go see your wife and.

03:05:55,378 --> 03:05:58,595
Trying to find the

03:05:58,595 --> 03:06:00,578

4992
03:06:02,262 --> 03:06:02,745
What?

4993
03:06:03,696 --> 03:06:06,313
Get over here where we were.

4994
03:06:06,313 --> 03:06:08,580
Are you you mind you.

4995
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:10,797
Back in the shop.

4996
03:06:12,063 --> 03:06:13,947
Past the shop. OK?

4997
03:06:13,947 --> 03:06:15,230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not

4998
03:06:16,531 --> 03:06:18,514
my. This is pastiche.

4999
03:06:18,514 --> 03:06:21,148
Oh, my God. We can't play baseball.
Holy shit.

5000
03:06:21,365 --> 03:06:23,998
Would you play baseball? Fine, fine, fine.

5001
03:06:24,248 --> 03:06:25,749
You interested?

5002
03:06:25,982 --> 03:06:27,749
I'll do a few pitches.
Yeah, yeah. Come over here.

5003
03:06:27,749 --> 03:06:28,049
Come over here.

5004
03:06:28,049 --> 03:06:29,966
Play with me. Thank you.

5005
03:06:31,766 --> 03:06:32,700
I fucking hate you.

5006
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:34,567
Wait. Someone's moaning.

5007
03:06:34,567 --> 03:06:35,817
Who's moaning?

5008
03:06:37,384 --> 03:06:38,934
In the trailer?

5009
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:39,967
What's up?

5010
03:06:41,034 --> 03:06:42,384
Can I take a swig?

5011
03:06:42,384 --> 03:06:43,118
Yep. Go ahead.

5012
03:06:43,118 --> 03:06:45,268
I threw it at your nuts.

5013
03:06:47,668 --> 03:06:48,452
Bitch.

5014
03:06:48,452 --> 03:06:51,986
Like that oh.

5015
03:06:52,686 --> 03:06:54,069
Oh, bang.

5016
03:06:54,069 --> 03:06:58,437
Right, dude, oh.

5017
03:06:59,137 --> 03:06:59,737
That was good one.

5018
03:06:59,737 --> 03:07:02,554
Oh. Oh,

5019
03:07:03,604 --> 03:07:04,154
right.

5020
03:07:04,704 --> 03:07:06,788
OK, curveball.

5021
03:07:06,788 --> 03:07:08,788
All I could. Curve it to.

5022
03:07:09,271 --> 03:07:12,238
Oh, oh, oh.

5023
03:07:12,805 --> 03:07:15,039
Oh. Good. OK.

5024
03:07:16,106 --> 03:07:17,339
Oh, my God.

5025
03:07:17,339 --> 03:07:18,339
How are you hitting these?

5026
03:07:18,339 --> 03:07:19,539
How are you hitting these?

5027
03:07:19,539 --> 03:07:21,690
How are you hitting these?

5028
03:07:22,107 --> 03:07:23,973
Oh, oh, yeah.

5029
03:07:23,973 --> 03:07:24,874
Curveball.

5030
03:07:25,174 --> 03:07:26,707
Dude is bullshit.

5031
03:07:26,707 --> 03:07:27,874
Oh. Yes.

5032
03:07:27,874 --> 03:07:29,874
I'm gonna fall.
On. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

5033
03:07:29,874 --> 03:07:30,824
OK. OK,

5034
03:07:32,158 --> 03:07:32,608
all right.

5035
03:07:32,608 --> 03:07:34,892
Oh, my. God. All right,
that's enough. It's my turn.

5036
03:07:34,892 --> 03:07:37,025
Give me, give me, give me the bat.

5037
03:07:37,025 --> 03:07:38,976
OK. Holy shit.

5038
03:07:38,976 --> 03:07:40,292
I'm crazy.

5039
03:07:40,809 --> 03:07:41,676
Hi there.

5040
03:07:41,726 --> 03:07:43,476
Hi there. Give me your bet.

5041
03:07:43,476 --> 03:07:44,710
Can I have a go? Sure.

5042
03:07:44,710 --> 03:07:47,093
Can I go on your baseball? Thanks, sir.

5043
03:07:47,577 --> 03:07:50,227
Hey. Hey. Want to try?

5044
03:07:50,227 --> 03:07:50,677
Yeah.

5045
03:07:50,677 --> 03:07:53,128
I don't care. Those balls
throw those balls and I hit.

5046
03:07:53,211 --> 03:07:53,611
All right, all right.

5047
03:07:53,611 --> 03:07:54,711
I just got to swing.

5048
03:07:54,711 --> 03:07:57,895
How come on, one.

5049
03:07:57,895 --> 03:07:58,562
Throw it.

5050
03:07:59,612 --> 03:08:00,729
Huh? What?

5051
03:08:00,729 --> 03:08:01,845
Come on.

5052
03:08:04,046 --> 03:08:07,296
What's OK?

5053
03:08:07,296 --> 03:08:09,246
OK, I'll do it earlier.

5054
03:08:09,246 --> 03:08:10,563
Huh? Got it.

5055
03:08:10,563 --> 03:08:13,080
All right. I got it now.

5056
03:08:13,314 --> 03:08:14,764
I got it now.

5057
03:08:14,764 --> 03:08:15,697
Huh? Huh.

5058
03:08:15,697 --> 03:08:18,331
We come on. Oh.

5059
03:08:20,165 --> 03:08:22,232
Oh. Fuck.

5060
03:08:22,865 --> 03:08:24,399
Oh, no.

5061
03:08:24,399 --> 03:08:27,699
I got swinging, miss. Oh.

5062
03:08:30,116 --> 03:08:33,100
Oh. Oh.

5063
03:08:33,450 --> 03:08:36,117
Oh. Yeah. OK.

5064
03:08:36,150 --> 03:08:36,600
All right.

5065
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:37,050
All right.

5066
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:37,834
I get.

5067
03:08:38,234 --> 03:08:40,451
It. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

5068
03:08:40,451 --> 03:08:42,718
Judy so lame.

5069
03:08:46,202 --> 03:08:48,269
Come on, come on, come on.

5070
03:08:48,669 --> 03:08:49,952
Come on. Do it.

5071
03:08:49,952 --> 03:08:51,319
Do it. Whoo!

5072
03:08:51,319 --> 03:08:52,586
Oh, nice.

5073
03:08:52,586 --> 03:08:54,753
Fuck. Huh?

5074
03:08:55,386 --> 03:08:56,553
Now that's a homerun.

5075
03:08:56,553 --> 03:08:58,653
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah.

5076
03:08:59,070 --> 03:09:00,970
What the hell? I'll do it.

5077
03:09:00,970 --> 03:09:02,971
I'm under. Nice.

5078
03:09:03,987 --> 03:09:05,888
Under underwear.

5079
03:09:05,888 --> 03:09:06,721
Got it.

5080
03:09:07,321 --> 03:09:08,705
I get it. Underwear.

5081
03:09:08,705 --> 03:09:11,222
Oh. OK. That's enough. Thanks for. This.

5082
03:09:11,739 --> 03:09:14,456
OK, you were supposed to be always.

5083
03:09:14,456 --> 03:09:15,572
You are so bad. I want to hear.

5084
03:09:15,572 --> 03:09:17,789
What's nearby
the trailer. Hold on. I'm done.

5085
03:09:18,306 --> 03:09:19,240
OK, so you're out.

5086
03:09:19,240 --> 03:09:21,873
If you all said go check the trailer out,
there's stuff happening in there.

5087
03:09:22,207 --> 03:09:24,324
You just stop because, like, you're bad
and then you lost.

5088
03:09:24,357 --> 03:09:26,941
No, I'm not bad.

5089
03:09:27,874 --> 03:09:29,008
This trailer

5090
03:09:39,326 --> 03:09:40,293
Are they jumping?

5091
03:09:40,293 --> 03:09:43,143
I think they're playing
jumping jacks or something.

5092
03:09:43,143 --> 03:09:45,843
Probably exercise you Mysta. the.

5093
03:09:45,843 --> 03:09:46,693
So look it so.

5094
03:09:47,994 --> 03:09:50,844
Mysta. Mysta. Mysta.

5095
03:09:51,327 --> 03:09:52,811
Mysta. Bad. Bad boy.

5096
03:09:52,811 --> 03:09:55,145
Can't see anything. Bad boy.

5097
03:09:55,145 --> 03:09:56,311
You can't see anything.

5098
03:09:56,311 --> 03:09:57,512
Or you can't.

5099
03:09:57,928 --> 03:09:59,795
I couldn't see anything. Hold
on. I'm going.

5100
03:09:59,795 --> 03:10:00,695
Take another look.

5101
03:10:00,695 --> 03:10:02,996
If you tell me if you're trolling me
right now.

5102
03:10:03,929 --> 03:10:05,979
I can't see anything.

5103
03:10:09,213 --> 03:10:09,630
I can't.

5104
03:10:09,630 --> 03:10:12,397
Yeah.
I can't hear anything either. What's.

5105
03:10:12,397 --> 03:10:13,097
I mean, I can.

5106
03:10:13,097 --> 03:10:16,014
I can. I can hear. I just can't see.

5107
03:10:16,014 --> 03:10:17,964
Tell me, like, go inside.

5108
03:10:17,964 --> 03:10:21,298
No. You want to join them? Why?

5109
03:10:21,415 --> 03:10:22,048
I just want to.

5110
03:10:22,048 --> 03:10:24,099
I just want to watch.

5111
03:10:25,232 --> 03:10:27,599
While you can enjoy while I'm gone.

5112
03:10:27,599 --> 03:10:28,766
OK, let's.

5113
03:10:28,766 --> 03:10:30,149
I'm going to continue with the game.

5114
03:10:30,149 --> 03:10:32,433
You can try to give me a. Boost,
and I go in for the top.

5115
03:10:32,466 --> 03:10:34,117
Stop.

5116
03:10:34,117 --> 03:10:34,984
Ha ha ha.

5117
03:10:36,234 --> 03:10:38,817
Oh, God.

5118
03:10:38,817 --> 03:10:39,484
And, you.

5119
03:10:39,484 --> 03:10:42,968
Know, you're not insensitive, and you can
handle me through things right now.

5120
03:10:44,468 --> 03:10:45,302
You're sexy.

5121
03:10:45,302 --> 03:10:48,169
You're fucking sexy.
Because I want to watch someone.

5122
03:10:48,185 --> 03:10:50,619
Doesn't mean that I'm into NPR.

5123
03:10:50,619 --> 03:10:53,269
As voyeurism. Voyeurism. That's what it's.

5124
03:10:53,286 --> 03:10:55,653
Guess I have 100% on voyeurism, actually.

5125
03:10:56,103 --> 03:10:58,620
Oh, hey.

5126
03:11:00,387 --> 03:11:02,354
I see just fine.

5127
03:11:05,971 --> 03:11:06,805
Cops.

5128
03:11:07,955 --> 03:11:10,855
08. 080.

5129
03:11:17,156 --> 03:11:20,156
Oh. Now big. Oh.

5130
03:11:20,156 --> 03:11:22,373
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

5131
03:11:22,373 --> 03:11:23,457
Yeah, I do mind.

5132
03:11:23,457 --> 03:11:24,574
I'm kind of busy here.

5133
03:11:24,574 --> 03:11:27,758
And your husband has broken out of prison.

5134
03:11:28,674 --> 03:11:30,875
Stop calling me ma'am. OK.

5135
03:11:30,875 --> 03:11:33,025
I have no clue where he is. Oh, shit.

5136
03:11:33,508 --> 03:11:35,575
If he tries. She looks like someone.

5137
03:11:36,209 --> 03:11:36,809
Yeah.

5138
03:11:37,176 --> 03:11:39,726
From like who? Oh, I don't know.

5139
03:11:40,026 --> 03:11:44,110
She looks like someone from, like, left
for dead or something.

5140
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:45,327
I don't know.

5141
03:11:47,577 --> 03:11:50,977
One or two to four.

5142
03:11:51,294 --> 03:11:53,611
So she looks for the poor little girl.

5143
03:11:53,611 --> 03:11:56,278
I've never played Portal. Oh,

5144
03:11:57,328 --> 03:11:58,028
so you're.

5145
03:11:58,028 --> 03:11:58,479
Stupid.

5146
03:11:58,479 --> 03:12:02,312
So that makes sense. I

5147
03:12:04,596 --> 03:12:05,646
you need to have, like,

5148
03:12:05,646 --> 03:12:10,230
some brain cells to play Portal,
and you're like, you know.

5149
03:12:10,714 --> 03:12:12,014
Of course we are.

5150
03:12:12,014 --> 03:12:12,814
Are you OK?

5151
03:12:12,814 --> 03:12:14,514
You know, you're going to slam my.

5152
03:12:14,514 --> 03:12:17,048
Cock against your face, you.
Stupid little.

5153
03:12:17,615 --> 03:12:18,748
Oh, it's.

5154
03:12:20,132 --> 03:12:22,832
Like a moulding.

5155
03:12:22,982 --> 03:12:25,649
I'm officially not.

5156
03:12:25,649 --> 03:12:27,666
Your son rejected you.

5157
03:12:27,666 --> 03:12:29,583
Like it's stupid.

5158
03:12:31,717 --> 03:12:33,750
Ozzy, man, I got out of prison.

5159
03:12:33,750 --> 03:12:35,467
Don't worry, Leo.

5160
03:12:35,467 --> 03:12:37,884
He's just a little bit upset.

5161
03:12:37,984 --> 03:12:41,401
Why He found out.

5162
03:12:42,668 --> 03:12:44,818
Yeah, he saw it in the papers.

5163
03:12:44,968 --> 03:12:47,069
Oh, shit. So what?

5164
03:12:47,069 --> 03:12:48,869
It's OK, baby.

5165
03:12:48,869 --> 03:12:50,369
So what.

5166
03:12:50,469 --> 03:12:52,736
You're wants it. Criminal. You escaped.

5167
03:12:52,736 --> 03:12:53,670
He committed you.

5168
03:12:53,670 --> 03:12:55,236
You murdered people.

5169
03:12:55,236 --> 03:12:57,687
Do you like me now? Yes, you are.

5170
03:12:58,187 --> 03:13:00,354
Yeah. I'm murder. Yeah.
You murdered people along the way.

5171
03:13:00,354 --> 03:13:01,404
Did you not see the cop car?

5172
03:13:01,404 --> 03:13:03,088
I fell off the cliff.
I need to tell you what's going on.

5173
03:13:03,088 --> 03:13:04,804
You shot. People.

5174
03:13:04,804 --> 03:13:07,205
You just leave all this stuff.

5175
03:13:07,321 --> 03:13:11,072
You were sitting in the back of the pickup
truck shooting people the entire time.

5176
03:13:11,189 --> 03:13:12,722
You're telling me you didn't kill anyone.

5177
03:13:14,039 --> 03:13:15,756
But that's after I went to prison.

5178
03:13:15,756 --> 03:13:16,990
He doesn't know that.

5179
03:13:16,990 --> 03:13:18,156
Oh, my God.

5180
03:13:18,156 --> 03:13:20,573
He knows me. For well, in prison.

5181
03:13:20,573 --> 03:13:23,690
Oh, he doesn't know that I did.

5182
03:13:23,757 --> 03:13:24,391
The cops.

5183
03:13:24,391 --> 03:13:27,574
Oh, go on the volunteer trail
and take your food.

5184
03:13:27,924 --> 03:13:28,975
What? They said?

5185
03:13:28,975 --> 03:13:31,292
Can I keep my food? Bullshit.

5186
03:13:31,925 --> 03:13:32,575
Oh, trust me.

5187
03:13:32,575 --> 03:13:33,358
I know

5188
03:13:35,375 --> 03:13:37,142
Still fixing bikes.

5189
03:13:37,142 --> 03:13:38,793
Still fixing those bikes.

5190
03:13:38,793 --> 03:13:39,426
You know I do.

5191
03:13:39,426 --> 03:13:40,976
Oh, can we do dogs?

5192
03:13:40,976 --> 03:13:42,826
Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

5193
03:13:42,826 --> 03:13:44,660
This is not Alex.

5194
03:13:46,077 --> 03:13:47,994
Whereas I want to do that.

5195
03:13:47,994 --> 03:13:50,644
Oh. Oh, my God. Who

5196
03:13:51,678 --> 03:13:51,811
All right.

5197
03:13:51,811 --> 03:13:53,611
Why are you doing this?

5198
03:13:53,695 --> 03:13:54,328
Over here.

5199
03:13:54,328 --> 03:13:56,695
Oh! Oh, my God.

5200
03:13:58,445 --> 03:14:00,696
Oh, wow.

5201
03:14:00,696 --> 03:14:03,029
Dude, OK. Yeah. 103.

5202
03:14:03,279 --> 03:14:06,630
All right, your turn.

5203
03:14:08,947 --> 03:14:10,647
I'm good at darts.

5204
03:14:10,647 --> 03:14:12,331
You're about to see right now.

5205
03:14:12,331 --> 03:14:14,581
And can you get out the way I call for
when you're in the way?

5206
03:14:15,148 --> 03:14:15,914
I can't. For what?

5207
03:14:17,731 --> 03:14:18,598
Am I in your way?

5208
03:14:18,598 --> 03:14:20,882
I mean, the way out the way.
Am I in the way?

5209
03:14:20,882 --> 03:14:21,215
I don't know.

5210
03:14:21,215 --> 03:14:21,899
I was in the way.

5211
03:14:21,899 --> 03:14:22,715
I'm sorry. I didn't.

5212
03:14:22,715 --> 03:14:24,899
I was in the way. Oh, my God.

5213
03:14:25,166 --> 03:14:28,166
I'm giving you a tattoo. Right now.

5214
03:14:28,266 --> 03:14:29,883
OK. Move.

5215
03:14:29,883 --> 03:14:30,900
More.

5216
03:14:30,967 --> 03:14:32,217
More.

5217
03:14:32,617 --> 03:14:35,217
OK. More. OK.

5218
03:14:36,101 --> 03:14:38,634
Dad, I just don't know why

5219
03:14:40,885 --> 03:14:43,235
Fucking God.

5220
03:14:43,735 --> 03:14:44,568
Look.

5221
03:14:46,202 --> 03:14:47,886
Beat this.

5222
03:14:48,036 --> 03:14:49,119
These

5223
03:14:50,936 --> 03:14:51,636
Move it, move it.

5224
03:14:51,636 --> 03:14:52,770
Move it down to the centre.

5225
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:54,503
Move it to the centre.

5226
03:14:54,753 --> 03:14:55,170
I don't need it.

5227
03:14:55,170 --> 03:14:57,954
And since a couple of baby.

5228
03:14:57,954 --> 03:14:59,371
Triples, why me?

5229
03:14:59,371 --> 03:15:01,487
I don't. Understand.
I don't understand what you just did.

5230
03:15:01,504 --> 03:15:04,038
What just happened there? Oh, boy.

5231
03:15:04,088 --> 03:15:05,938
What did you do?

5232
03:15:06,005 --> 03:15:06,872
Is that, like, a rule?

5233
03:15:06,872 --> 03:15:08,255
I don't know about darts.

5234
03:15:08,255 --> 03:15:08,738
I'm playing.

5235
03:15:08,738 --> 03:15:10,539
Darts for.

5236
03:15:13,406 --> 03:15:15,489
Holy crap. And

5237
03:15:18,206 --> 03:15:19,223
that's pretty cool, I guess.

5238
03:15:19,223 --> 03:15:19,773
Yeah.

5239
03:15:20,107 --> 03:15:20,757
Pretty cool.

5240
03:15:20,757 --> 03:15:22,024
Pretty cool.

5241
03:15:25,074 --> 03:15:27,008
Yeah, I got good aim.

5242
03:15:27,008 --> 03:15:29,075
Wow, dude. Wow.

5243
03:15:29,308 --> 03:15:30,775
OK, you're setting goals.

5244
03:15:30,775 --> 03:15:31,775
You know.

5245
03:15:31,775 --> 03:15:33,359
However, what what do you mean?

5246
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:35,759
How many points ahead of me?

5247
03:15:35,759 --> 03:15:36,926
Have you got three bull's eyes?

5248
03:15:36,926 --> 03:15:38,559
Because you suck

5249
03:15:40,060 --> 03:15:41,410
you're not supposed to go for bull's eyes.

5250
03:15:41,410 --> 03:15:43,377
And darts are supposed
to get four triples.

5251
03:15:43,377 --> 03:15:44,343
What do you mean, triples?

5252
03:15:44,343 --> 03:15:47,094
I don't understand what that means.

5253
03:15:48,661 --> 03:15:49,344
Whoa.

5254
03:15:49,344 --> 03:15:51,178
Beautiful lights.

5255
03:15:51,178 --> 03:15:52,078
How does this work?

5256
03:15:52,078 --> 03:15:54,778
I've never played darts before.

5257
03:15:55,328 --> 03:15:56,762
You never play darts? No.

5258
03:15:56,762 --> 03:15:58,779
I don't know. How this works.
I just got to go for this answer.

5259
03:15:58,929 --> 03:15:59,829
What is that?

5260
03:15:59,829 --> 03:16:03,063
What is that? What?

5261
03:16:03,063 --> 03:16:04,596
I thought you just got to.

5262
03:16:04,596 --> 03:16:08,063
You got to go for this answer one half oh.

5263
03:16:08,364 --> 03:16:10,464
Not a bull's eye. Sucks. Did.

5264
03:16:10,464 --> 03:16:12,781
Bull's eye socks? Yes.

5265
03:16:13,948 --> 03:16:15,414
You go for triple 20.

5266
03:16:15,414 --> 03:16:17,181
Is the.

5267
03:16:17,181 --> 03:16:20,198
The inner ring is a triple. Right. OK, OK.

5268
03:16:20,249 --> 03:16:22,365
And then the outer ring is a double fuck.

5269
03:16:22,932 --> 03:16:24,399
Fuck.

5270
03:16:24,866 --> 03:16:27,199
Oh, the hell with sammy. OK.

5271
03:16:27,216 --> 03:16:27,550
All right.

5272
03:16:27,550 --> 03:16:28,316
I understand.

5273
03:16:28,316 --> 03:16:29,683
OK, you're not serious.

5274
03:16:29,683 --> 03:16:31,717
You. I had a I have a z buff.

5275
03:16:31,717 --> 03:16:33,984
I had a fucking z buff.
I don't know if they died so far.

5276
03:16:34,317 --> 03:16:36,484
I got I got gypped by the rolls.

5277
03:16:36,684 --> 03:16:38,018
Nice bike.

5278
03:16:38,468 --> 03:16:40,835
Thanks, guys. This is so good at darts.

5279
03:16:40,835 --> 03:16:41,818
I like darts.

5280
03:16:41,818 --> 03:16:43,585
How long have you known Leo?

5281
03:16:43,585 --> 03:16:45,869
A while, I guess. It'll fuck you. This.

5282
03:16:45,869 --> 03:16:46,836
This is so shit.

5283
03:16:46,836 --> 03:16:50,253
That's your son's drawing.

5284
03:16:50,736 --> 03:16:52,953
So shakey.

5285
03:16:53,220 --> 03:16:56,254
Fuck. Is that your son?

5286
03:16:56,254 --> 03:16:58,254
That's your son.

5287
03:16:58,254 --> 03:17:00,954
What do you mean? Who the fuck is this?

5288
03:17:00,954 --> 03:17:03,638
59. Violence. Bike.

5289
03:17:05,005 --> 03:17:05,605
Yeah.

5290
03:17:05,605 --> 03:17:06,188
Thanks.

5291
03:17:06,188 --> 03:17:08,705
No wonder he hates you.

5292
03:17:09,372 --> 03:17:11,639
OK, let's watch this house.

5293
03:17:11,639 --> 03:17:12,056
Leave me.

5294
03:17:12,056 --> 03:17:13,706
Alone. Well, fuck you.

5295
03:17:13,706 --> 03:17:15,756
Go to hell.

5296
03:17:15,990 --> 03:17:16,840
Whoa, kid.

5297
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,390
Hold up. Hold up, kid. You can't just.

5298
03:17:18,390 --> 03:17:20,424
Where are you? Going

5299
03:17:20,724 --> 03:17:21,874
once you could stop him.

5300
03:17:21,874 --> 03:17:23,941
You know I can't stop.

5301
03:17:23,941 --> 03:17:26,108
No, I can't stop him. No, he's doing.

5302
03:17:26,108 --> 03:17:27,508
He's. He's too switch partners.

5303
03:17:27,508 --> 03:17:29,108
He's too slick with it.

5304
03:17:29,108 --> 03:17:30,308
Man. I watched you.

5305
03:17:30,308 --> 03:17:33,125
Piece you sick with it.

5306
03:17:34,292 --> 03:17:39,126
And I watched you let him go.

5307
03:17:40,176 --> 03:17:42,543
Go to the tree house
where we had to go to a tree house.

5308
03:17:42,777 --> 03:17:43,744
A tree house?

5309
03:17:43,744 --> 03:17:46,411
Oh, it's over there. OK,
can I go with you now?

5310
03:17:46,411 --> 03:17:48,444
This is your money.
This is only for you. Yeah.

5311
03:17:48,478 --> 03:17:50,194
Have you ever been to a tree house before?

5312
03:17:50,194 --> 03:17:51,245
I've never had a tree house.

5313
03:17:51,245 --> 03:17:53,695
I've never been to one now. Same.

5314
03:17:55,178 --> 03:17:56,379
I feel like doing some good this way.

5315
03:17:56,379 --> 03:17:57,745
Oh, you can.

5316
03:17:57,745 --> 03:17:58,562
So what do you do?

5317
03:17:58,562 --> 03:18:00,096
You just get no clocks?

5318
03:18:00,096 --> 03:18:02,379
Yeah, I just got talk to your wife.
I think I'm.

5319
03:18:02,379 --> 03:18:02,613
Waiting.

5320
03:18:02,613 --> 03:18:05,647
You're cooking me something.

5321
03:18:05,647 --> 03:18:07,764
And schmoozing your wife.
Grab me a wrench.

5322
03:18:08,047 --> 03:18:09,547
What the fuck?

5323
03:18:09,547 --> 03:18:12,031
Oh, my God. I am. Man. You're cooking me.

5324
03:18:12,114 --> 03:18:13,531
I am cooking you.

5325
03:18:13,531 --> 03:18:15,865
Come on, slap me up, Alex.

5326
03:18:15,865 --> 03:18:17,832
Dude, hey.

5327
03:18:19,715 --> 03:18:20,282
Vincenzo.

5328
03:18:20,282 --> 03:18:22,082
That's my wife now.

5329
03:18:23,949 --> 03:18:24,599
This.

5330
03:18:25,799 --> 03:18:27,300
What is this?

5331
03:18:27,416 --> 03:18:28,166
This is an axe cut.

5332
03:18:28,166 --> 03:18:30,717
I know it is broken.
Yeah, I could do that.

5333
03:18:31,267 --> 03:18:32,184
Oh, it's a sign.

5334
03:18:32,184 --> 03:18:35,067
Come down and help me fix it.

5335
03:18:35,968 --> 03:18:38,318
Just won't come down until I fix it.

5336
03:18:38,551 --> 03:18:39,785
I'm having a touching moment right

5337
03:18:39,785 --> 03:18:42,085
now, and you'll just messing around
with motorcycles.

5338
03:18:43,652 --> 03:18:45,636
I got an achievement for that.

5339
03:18:45,636 --> 03:18:47,436
I think I'm going to
need it. I didn't get share

5340
03:18:49,919 --> 03:18:52,586
you need
a hammer and a hammer to fix this one.

5341
03:18:52,586 --> 03:18:53,737
There's a hammer right there.

5342
03:18:53,737 --> 03:18:57,454
It's got to be cut the hammer

5343
03:18:58,137 --> 03:19:00,054
You're really just helping my wife, right?

5344
03:19:00,054 --> 03:19:01,438
Yes, I am.

5345
03:19:02,221 --> 03:19:03,905
Maybe you're

5346
03:19:07,255 --> 03:19:09,722
downtown the bank.

5347
03:19:09,722 --> 03:19:11,889
Oh, this sign is beautiful.

5348
03:19:11,889 --> 03:19:14,190
Alex, you should come down and see it.

5349
03:19:14,190 --> 03:19:16,857
Give your give
your wife's ride on the spike

5350
03:19:21,624 --> 03:19:22,974
what's it?

5351
03:19:22,974 --> 03:19:25,441
This kid is so easily influenced me.

5352
03:19:25,474 --> 03:19:27,758
What happened?
I wasn't paying attention. It was.

5353
03:19:27,758 --> 03:19:33,909
All I did was fix a sign,
and I was back down oh.

5354
03:19:35,109 --> 03:19:36,243
Fuck you.

5355
03:19:36,243 --> 03:19:38,910
He loves you. Oh, yeah.
I see a lot of him.

5356
03:19:38,910 --> 03:19:40,410
What do you mean,
you don't want to hug him?

5357
03:19:40,410 --> 03:19:42,093
That's your child.

5358
03:19:42,093 --> 03:19:42,894
Would just run away.

5359
03:19:42,894 --> 03:19:44,544
From me like an asshole. He's.

5360
03:19:44,544 --> 03:19:45,877
He's confused.

5361
03:19:45,877 --> 03:19:48,211
He doesn't know, like,
what to think. Basketball.

5362
03:19:48,578 --> 03:19:50,545
I just play basketball. Basketball?

5363
03:19:50,545 --> 03:19:53,078
I'm better than. You at basketball
right. Now. You're not?

5364
03:19:54,278 --> 03:19:54,895
Yes, I am.

5365
03:19:54,895 --> 03:19:57,179
OK, this guy might.

5366
03:19:57,596 --> 03:19:58,946
Want to shoot some hoops.

5367
03:19:58,946 --> 03:20:01,046
That could be fun,
but maybe we should get going.

5368
03:20:01,563 --> 03:20:03,846
Oh, come on. Just one game.

5369
03:20:03,963 --> 03:20:06,697
Just one. Just one, guys. One game.

5370
03:20:06,864 --> 03:20:07,447
Get ready.

5371
03:20:07,447 --> 03:20:10,814
That boy seems like a terrible idea
when I.

5372
03:20:10,947 --> 03:20:11,881
You know, I win.

5373
03:20:11,881 --> 03:20:14,915
I ain't like a kid. Beat me.

5374
03:20:14,915 --> 03:20:16,382
I think he's going to roll you.

5375
03:20:16,382 --> 03:20:17,032
I don't know.

5376
03:20:17,032 --> 03:20:19,449
It's you thinking
this kid is going to roll me.

5377
03:20:19,599 --> 03:20:21,716
He got one. It's yours. Ok?

5378
03:20:21,716 --> 03:20:22,266
Oh, shit.

5379
03:20:22,266 --> 03:20:25,266
OK. Oh, shit. OK.

5380
03:20:25,299 --> 03:20:28,167
Wait. Five

5381
03:20:29,167 --> 03:20:32,367
Daddy, pass it to me.

5382
03:20:32,367 --> 03:20:34,167
Knock, knock him over.

5383
03:20:34,167 --> 03:20:36,234
Knock him over. Come over. Vincent.

5384
03:20:36,751 --> 03:20:37,768
I don't know

5385
03:20:40,052 --> 03:20:43,169
oh, you suck my ball now going.

5386
03:20:43,502 --> 03:20:46,569
What's. That's it.

5387
03:20:46,886 --> 03:20:48,203
Ow! Ow! Ow!

5388
03:20:48,203 --> 03:20:52,620
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, fell.

5389
03:20:52,803 --> 03:20:54,420
Oh, there you go.

5390
03:20:54,420 --> 03:20:56,704
No, my now, bitch.

5391
03:20:56,971 --> 03:20:59,221
Oh, oh, fuck off. That's mine.

5392
03:21:02,638 --> 03:21:03,988
Wait, your kids sucks.

5393
03:21:03,988 --> 03:21:04,888
Yes, I know.

5394
03:21:04,888 --> 03:21:07,839
This kid's OK.

5395
03:21:07,839 --> 03:21:09,656
Why is this kid so bad?

5396
03:21:09,656 --> 03:21:12,089
Oh, my God. On he got the bad genes.

5397
03:21:12,239 --> 03:21:12,506
Oh, look.

5398
03:21:12,506 --> 03:21:13,540
See that

5399
03:21:14,306 --> 03:21:15,757

5400
03:21:16,773 --> 03:21:22,307
proposed to me by Kobe you.

5401
03:21:22,891 --> 03:21:24,158
You're such a gremlin.

5402
03:21:24,158 --> 03:21:24,424
What's it?

5403
03:21:24,424 --> 03:21:27,058
Schoenbaum

5404
03:21:27,925 --> 03:21:28,742
oh, now he has it.

5405
03:21:28,742 --> 03:21:29,625
How did he get.

5406
03:21:29,625 --> 03:21:30,175
I don't know.

5407
03:21:30,175 --> 03:21:32,426
How he. Doing? What? Help, Alex?

5408
03:21:32,876 --> 03:21:34,593
What is he doing?

5409
03:21:34,593 --> 03:21:35,609
What am I supposed to be?

5410
03:21:35,609 --> 03:21:37,410
I'm his phone

5411
03:21:38,276 --> 03:21:39,510
why did you do that?

5412
03:21:39,510 --> 03:21:40,493
I don't know.

5413
03:21:40,493 --> 03:21:42,777
I thought you know
this. You're you're. Good.

5414
03:21:43,044 --> 03:21:44,611
You think? Yeah.

5415
03:21:44,611 --> 03:21:46,027
What the hell, man?

5416
03:21:46,027 --> 03:21:48,728
Really I'm trying to hype him up.

5417
03:21:48,878 --> 03:21:49,678
He wants to be.

5418
03:21:49,678 --> 03:21:52,078
He wants to be a basketball player.

5419
03:21:52,078 --> 03:21:53,795
That's my kid, bro.

5420
03:21:53,795 --> 03:21:55,045
Hey, beautiful.

5421
03:21:55,045 --> 03:21:57,879
Hey. I think I'm just taking your family.

5422
03:21:58,346 --> 03:21:58,596
Yeah,

5423
03:21:59,729 --> 03:22:01,596
I hope I.

5424
03:22:01,596 --> 03:22:03,180
Your wife. Fine.

5425
03:22:03,180 --> 03:22:04,647
He's my son.

5426
03:22:04,647 --> 03:22:05,430
I know.

5427
03:22:05,664 --> 03:22:07,530
And I took your basketball school.

5428
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:10,314
I'm a basketball bitch. Alex.

5429
03:22:10,614 --> 03:22:11,464
Here you go.

5430
03:22:11,464 --> 03:22:14,348
Still playing with him. To.

5431
03:22:15,848 --> 03:22:18,099
So this is home now?

5432
03:22:18,099 --> 03:22:19,615
I had. I leave. Give me out of here.

5433
03:22:19,615 --> 03:22:21,782
I have to walk into this Mysta. I'm stuck.

5434
03:22:21,782 --> 03:22:22,983
I get moving.

5435
03:22:23,516 --> 03:22:25,966
You stay with my son.

5436
03:22:25,966 --> 03:22:28,117
How we get me out.

5437
03:22:28,367 --> 03:22:30,617
I'm going to go you for sex.

5438
03:22:30,617 --> 03:22:33,017
See x oh, my god.

5439
03:22:33,151 --> 03:22:33,784
Just dunks.

5440
03:22:33,784 --> 03:22:34,684
I trust

5441
03:22:35,284 --> 03:22:37,435
you dunk my balls into my wife.

5442
03:22:37,435 --> 03:22:39,568
That's why you dunked. Shows.

5443
03:22:39,568 --> 03:22:41,602
Leo. Fucking loser. Let's just deal.

5444
03:22:41,635 --> 03:22:44,019
I'm stuck, i'm stuck.
I can't get out of here.

5445
03:22:44,019 --> 03:22:45,636
I really have to entertain the child.

5446
03:22:45,636 --> 03:22:47,336
No, knock me out.

5447
03:22:47,336 --> 03:22:48,903
Kick me out

5448
03:22:52,953 --> 03:22:54,504
you guys are going to have sex.

5449
03:22:56,104 --> 03:22:59,438
Ray, can I join that ass? No.

5450
03:23:00,121 --> 03:23:01,988
I'm sure he knows where Harvey's hiding.

5451
03:23:01,988 --> 03:23:04,055
Paula, let me check her out,
and then you can join.

5452
03:23:04,388 --> 03:23:06,755
He's working at the construction site
downtown.

5453
03:23:08,139 --> 03:23:08,789
Yeah.

5454
03:23:09,906 --> 03:23:12,790
I need you to be ready
to leave the country soon.

5455
03:23:12,790 --> 03:23:13,656
Don't worry about that.

5456
03:23:13,656 --> 03:23:14,723
I'll take care of it.

5457
03:23:14,723 --> 03:23:15,323
Oh, my God.

5458
03:23:15,323 --> 03:23:17,190
My wife is so nice.

5459
03:23:17,190 --> 03:23:19,290
Yeah. Now, don't just scare me.

5460
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:21,124
Get back safe or I'll kick your ass.

5461
03:23:21,124 --> 03:23:23,424
Oh, Jesus. Ow!

5462
03:23:23,424 --> 03:23:24,825
Ow! Ow!

5463
03:23:25,025 --> 03:23:26,908
OK. I do.

5464
03:23:26,908 --> 03:23:29,525
White Jesus.

5465
03:23:29,709 --> 03:23:31,209
Well, she's really nice.

5466
03:23:31,209 --> 03:23:33,242
I thought she'd be angry at you.

5467
03:23:33,242 --> 03:23:34,809
She's a top.

5468
03:23:34,976 --> 03:23:37,926
That's
where I get my top energy from my wife.

5469
03:23:38,527 --> 03:23:40,827
Really? I don't think that's how it works.

5470
03:23:40,827 --> 03:23:42,027
Here you go.

5471
03:23:44,461 --> 03:23:47,228
Oh, she's just black.

5472
03:23:47,228 --> 03:23:48,745
I think you have a gun. Help us.

5473
03:23:49,945 --> 03:23:52,045
Oh, I'm going to kiss her.

5474
03:23:52,045 --> 03:23:52,495
Don't look.

5475
03:23:52,495 --> 03:23:53,462
Don't look.

5476
03:23:55,412 --> 03:23:56,012
I'm looking at you.

5477
03:23:56,012 --> 03:23:58,546
You're literally staring right now.
The fuck is wrong with you?

5478
03:23:58,813 --> 03:24:00,813
You were. Really good. Yeah.

5479
03:24:00,813 --> 03:24:03,113
Like I said, you're a real pro.

5480
03:24:03,113 --> 03:24:04,313
You think.

5481
03:24:05,314 --> 03:24:07,231
Yeah. You played with my kids.

5482
03:24:07,231 --> 03:24:08,431
High five.

5483
03:24:08,431 --> 03:24:11,815
I was subjected to torments
while you fucking had

5484
03:24:11,815 --> 03:24:13,915
sex for, like, the past 3 hours.

5485
03:24:15,698 --> 03:24:17,282
But you take care of your mom now.

5486
03:24:17,282 --> 03:24:19,016
All right? Can we be.

5487
03:24:19,016 --> 03:24:21,349
Relaxed? I was up.
3 hours is like, 2 minutes.

5488
03:24:21,366 --> 03:24:22,866
Oh, come on, give me a hug.

5489
03:24:22,866 --> 03:24:25,166
Oh. Look at that.

5490
03:24:26,100 --> 03:24:28,050
You are my son.

5491
03:24:28,050 --> 03:24:30,450
Go to your mom now. OK?

5492
03:24:30,450 --> 03:24:33,484
You said you are my son.

5493
03:24:33,484 --> 03:24:34,984
Oh, oh. Is he adopted?

5494
03:24:34,984 --> 03:24:35,751
Thank you.

5495
03:24:36,218 --> 03:24:37,718
By the way, son, you're adopted.

5496
03:24:37,718 --> 03:24:38,618
Goodbye.

5497
03:24:38,818 --> 03:24:42,535
Well, I was just reminding him
you are nice

5498
03:24:43,136 --> 03:24:45,369
that you said you aren't my son.

5499
03:24:45,369 --> 03:24:47,886
No, you are. You are.

5500
03:24:47,886 --> 03:24:50,220
Oh. Oh, look, it's. GTA.

5501
03:24:53,337 --> 03:24:54,004
You said that.

5502
03:24:54,004 --> 03:24:55,737
Room five.

5503
03:24:56,137 --> 03:24:57,988
I want to play GTA. I don't play.

5504
03:24:57,988 --> 03:24:59,755
I didn't say it was GTA.

5505
03:24:59,755 --> 03:25:00,538
Oh, yeah, it is.

5506
03:25:00,538 --> 03:25:02,155
Yes, you did. You better.

5507
03:25:02,155 --> 03:25:03,605
What if he doesn't.

5508
03:25:04,622 --> 03:25:05,639
I'm recycling consent.

5509
03:25:05,639 --> 03:25:07,439
OK, it's been like an hour since then.

5510
03:25:07,439 --> 03:25:09,806
Most people have like funnelled out
and you people are in. OK.

5511
03:25:10,139 --> 03:25:11,606
Is that how it works?

5512
03:25:11,606 --> 03:25:12,506
Yes, yes.

5513
03:25:12,506 --> 03:25:14,607
When we had to talk to someone.

5514
03:25:14,823 --> 03:25:15,540
What's the problem?

5515
03:25:15,540 --> 03:25:18,907
What's the problem is a coffee shop,
which is a construction site.

5516
03:25:18,907 --> 03:25:20,674
You can't just waltz in here.

5517
03:25:20,674 --> 03:25:21,691
You know, put out hot hot.

5518
03:25:21,691 --> 03:25:24,841
Love threats bluff I want to bluff.

5519
03:25:25,508 --> 03:25:26,008
OK, fine.

5520
03:25:26,008 --> 03:25:28,442
It's bluff and you're going to stop me.

5521
03:25:28,442 --> 03:25:29,859
You'll have to excuse my colleague.

5522
03:25:29,859 --> 03:25:32,943
He hasn't had his morning coffee yet,
but he's right, though.

5523
03:25:33,359 --> 03:25:36,160
We're here to check
if this site is up to code.

5524
03:25:36,726 --> 03:25:38,610
Jesus Christ.

5525
03:25:38,610 --> 03:25:40,177
Another inspection.

5526
03:25:40,177 --> 03:25:41,794
What is with you guys back? Me?

5527
03:25:41,794 --> 03:25:44,494
I actually believe that Dominic comment.

5528
03:25:44,544 --> 03:25:46,944
Yeah, I'm coming in. Come in and come in.

5529
03:25:46,944 --> 03:25:48,478
Come in and come in.

5530
03:25:48,478 --> 03:25:51,095
Come endless. Come calm. Me.

5531
03:25:51,362 --> 03:25:53,829
Oh, my God. There you go. Whole

5532
03:25:54,929 --> 03:25:55,679
art house.

5533
03:25:55,679 --> 03:25:58,813
I hope you're building code, man.

5534
03:25:59,680 --> 03:26:01,080
You hard hats even work?

5535
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:01,713
How many?

5536
03:26:01,797 --> 03:26:02,663
I'm pretty sure they do.

5537
03:26:02,663 --> 03:26:05,064
Imagine, like, that big block of wood
just fell on your head.

5538
03:26:05,430 --> 03:26:07,897
OK, I think. I get squashed.

5539
03:26:07,897 --> 03:26:09,781
No, it would just it would slide off.

5540
03:26:09,781 --> 03:26:10,931
I wish I could say the same.

5541
03:26:10,931 --> 03:26:12,698
We just said the heart. It.

5542
03:26:12,698 --> 03:26:14,965
What the hell? Well, about safety.

5543
03:26:15,749 --> 03:26:16,832
Always cock.

5544
03:26:16,832 --> 03:26:18,566
What is that? To be afraid of it.

5545
03:26:18,566 --> 03:26:20,049
Nothing's going to happen, kid.

5546
03:26:20,049 --> 03:26:22,416
Nothing's going to happen. OK, all right.

5547
03:26:22,683 --> 03:26:24,450
I'm pretty sure I do.

5548
03:26:24,450 --> 03:26:28,117
Construction sites
have, like, a high fatality rate guy.

5549
03:26:28,117 --> 03:26:30,267
OK, so are you being sarcastic? What?

5550
03:26:31,051 --> 03:26:33,118
Me? No.
Oh, you just went into the toilets.

5551
03:26:33,351 --> 03:26:35,785
Honest people. Me, honestly,
knock me over.

5552
03:26:35,785 --> 03:26:38,702
Please
don't knock him. Is that possible? Hey.

5553
03:26:40,469 --> 03:26:42,386
Oh, hey, man.

5554
03:26:42,386 --> 03:26:45,319
Why is I

5555
03:26:45,319 --> 03:26:47,070
oh, hey.

5556
03:26:47,070 --> 03:26:48,353
What is he doing?

5557
03:26:48,353 --> 03:26:49,170
What?

5558
03:26:49,170 --> 03:26:52,004
I can't hear you for your book.

5559
03:26:52,237 --> 03:26:54,087
It's my what?

5560
03:26:54,454 --> 03:26:56,738
You're I don't think you're talking
to the right guy.

5561
03:26:56,738 --> 03:26:57,688
He's probably.

5562
03:26:57,688 --> 03:26:58,955
You know where he is.

5563
03:26:58,955 --> 03:27:00,805
What? Mysta.

5564
03:27:00,805 --> 03:27:02,438
Your boss, miss?

5565
03:27:02,438 --> 03:27:04,689
You're talking to the wrong dude.

5566
03:27:04,689 --> 03:27:06,722
What do you mean? He's just stupid.

5567
03:27:07,172 --> 03:27:08,789
He can't hear you.

5568
03:27:08,789 --> 03:27:10,923
He can't hear you. He's jacking it.

5569
03:27:11,490 --> 03:27:13,207
Why does he turn it off?

5570
03:27:13,207 --> 03:27:15,274
He talks to him no. Oh, my god.

5571
03:27:15,574 --> 03:27:17,857
Fine, fine. Let's go get us nowhere.

5572
03:27:18,874 --> 03:27:21,808
No watch.

5573
03:27:21,808 --> 03:27:22,258
Sorry.

5574
03:27:22,258 --> 03:27:25,175
All right, you guys you're

5575
03:27:25,175 --> 03:27:25,825
busy.

5576
03:27:27,609 --> 03:27:29,376
I know you got all week.

5577
03:27:29,376 --> 03:27:30,626
I fucking knew.

5578
03:27:30,626 --> 03:27:32,109
You'd take a break.

5579
03:27:32,109 --> 03:27:34,660
And I did I can't take a break now.

5580
03:27:34,660 --> 03:27:35,560
I will find my.

5581
03:27:35,560 --> 03:27:36,460
Oh, my God.

5582
03:27:36,460 --> 03:27:38,927
That's Ashley Reagan's whereabouts.

5583
03:27:40,244 --> 03:27:41,294
Does is.

5584
03:27:41,294 --> 03:27:43,327
Dude, the cow likes me.

5585
03:27:43,627 --> 03:27:47,728
The fucking jock camera guy likes me
or likes me in this game.

5586
03:27:47,795 --> 03:27:50,045
Why is that, Leo?

5587
03:27:50,045 --> 03:27:50,879
I don't know.

5588
03:27:50,879 --> 03:27:53,512
Everyone hates me, even the animals.

5589
03:27:53,512 --> 03:27:56,046
Sam Beck is killing me.

5590
03:27:56,046 --> 03:27:59,696
I have to quit this job
before I end up a cripple. Ha.

5591
03:27:59,730 --> 03:28:02,730
I found an elevator.
Oh. Ooh, elevator use.

5592
03:28:02,997 --> 03:28:05,214
Come on in, baby. Come on in. Hold on.

5593
03:28:05,214 --> 03:28:06,697
I'm going to look around real quick.

5594
03:28:06,697 --> 03:28:08,848
You really got to me. Hey,
can we do this with each other?

5595
03:28:09,248 --> 03:28:10,865
Oh, my God.

5596
03:28:10,865 --> 03:28:12,298
OK, fine.

5597
03:28:13,082 --> 03:28:14,665
No, Jeff.

5598
03:28:14,665 --> 03:28:15,599
Over there. Arm wrestling.

5599
03:28:15,599 --> 03:28:17,882
Wrestling. Hold on. Wait.
Hold on a second.

5600
03:28:17,882 --> 03:28:19,599
Yeah. Can't handle it.

5601
03:28:19,599 --> 03:28:20,999
All right, you want it?

5602
03:28:20,999 --> 03:28:23,400
I'm going to arm wrestle all right.

5603
03:28:23,633 --> 03:28:25,933
Well, no, no,
I won't arm wrestle till you give me.

5604
03:28:25,983 --> 03:28:27,917
All right, finally the thing.

5605
03:28:27,917 --> 03:28:29,634
Oh, here we go.

5606
03:28:29,634 --> 03:28:32,518
Here you go. Oh, Mysta. This. Here we go.

5607
03:28:32,584 --> 03:28:35,168
We take him down one. Yeah,

5608
03:28:39,369 --> 03:28:41,169
not enough.

5609
03:28:43,819 --> 03:28:45,670
Man. Come on, come on.

5610
03:28:45,670 --> 03:28:47,403
What the fuck

5611
03:28:48,603 --> 03:28:51,420
mister? Nice

5612
03:28:52,737 --> 03:28:53,854
mister. Mysta.

5613
03:28:53,854 --> 03:28:54,454
I'm top.

5614
03:28:54,454 --> 03:28:55,688
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

5615
03:28:55,688 --> 03:28:57,938
I'm top dog.

5616
03:28:58,388 --> 03:29:00,422
You have to give up eventually.

5617
03:29:00,422 --> 03:29:02,005
Your fuck you bitch.

5618
03:29:02,005 --> 03:29:03,155
You bitch

5619
03:29:04,739 --> 03:29:07,556
oh, come on.

5620
03:29:08,523 --> 03:29:11,456
Give I give up, you know,

5621
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:14,707
fuck you

5622
03:29:15,474 --> 03:29:18,091
oh, my hand.

5623
03:29:18,324 --> 03:29:21,658
Oh, God, you. Oh.

5624
03:29:22,841 --> 03:29:25,275
Ow! Oh.

5625
03:29:25,808 --> 03:29:28,592
Mysta. Mister, my arm hurts my arm worse.

5626
03:29:28,826 --> 03:29:30,026
Thank you, Bob.

5627
03:29:30,026 --> 03:29:33,760
No, no, no more give up.

5628
03:29:33,926 --> 03:29:35,526
No take.

5629
03:29:35,526 --> 03:29:37,527
I'm going to go beyond

5630
03:29:41,311 --> 03:29:44,761
gas coupons.

5631
03:29:48,128 --> 03:29:49,078
Oh, my God.

5632
03:29:49,078 --> 03:29:52,679
I missed my fingers.

5633
03:29:54,462 --> 03:29:56,529
Why not?

5634
03:29:57,396 --> 03:29:59,046
No. Fuck you.

5635
03:29:59,046 --> 03:30:00,780
You've not, right? No. Fuck you.

5636
03:30:00,780 --> 03:30:01,530
I'm trying to prove a point.

5637
03:30:01,530 --> 03:30:02,247
I'm trying to prove a point.

5638
03:30:02,247 --> 03:30:03,747
He's got a point.

5639
03:30:05,164 --> 03:30:05,914
You make me laugh.

5640
03:30:05,914 --> 03:30:06,397
I got

5641
03:30:09,598 --> 03:30:12,082
you got

5642
03:30:14,582 --> 03:30:20,266
no, no, no, no. You

5643
03:30:22,266 --> 03:30:23,016
handle it.

5644
03:30:23,016 --> 03:30:26,067
Oh, my God. You are so bad.

5645
03:30:26,134 --> 03:30:27,684
You fuck my arm.

5646
03:30:27,684 --> 03:30:29,734
Oh, my God. Oh,

5647
03:30:30,934 --> 03:30:32,134
all right.

5648
03:30:32,134 --> 03:30:34,985
The strongest boxing wins again.

5649
03:30:36,002 --> 03:30:38,069
Oh, there's.

5650
03:30:38,069 --> 03:30:39,335
No rounds here.

5651
03:30:39,335 --> 03:30:40,869
You go get get back and get back
your best, too.

5652
03:30:40,869 --> 03:30:42,786
I think that's true.
I think that's two and three.

5653
03:30:42,786 --> 03:30:44,336
That's two out of three of us.
Two out of three.

5654
03:30:44,336 --> 03:30:45,720
I refuse.

5655
03:30:45,720 --> 03:30:47,287
I refuse.

5656
03:30:48,087 --> 03:30:50,187
Oh. Fine.

5657
03:30:50,187 --> 03:30:53,637
How? Why not? How?

5658
03:30:53,637 --> 03:30:55,704
If I win this one, I win. OK, fine.

5659
03:30:55,771 --> 03:30:57,721
If you want us younger, you win for real.

5660
03:30:57,721 --> 03:31:00,038
You have to go find my friend.
Let's do this.

5661
03:31:00,355 --> 03:31:01,555
Oh, my God.

5662
03:31:01,555 --> 03:31:04,022
Two, one,

5663
03:31:05,372 --> 03:31:08,790
come on, come on, come on.

5664
03:31:10,556 --> 03:31:11,273
Jeff,

5665
03:31:12,207 --> 03:31:14,224
what the fuck?

5666
03:31:14,224 --> 03:31:16,424
What do you mean,
what the fuck, your love.

5667
03:31:16,441 --> 03:31:17,274
I slipped.

5668
03:31:17,274 --> 03:31:17,641
What do you mean?

5669
03:31:17,641 --> 03:31:20,425
What the fuck
all right, let's do it again.

5670
03:31:20,425 --> 03:31:22,958
Let's do it again. Do again.
I was going easy on me last time.

5671
03:31:23,225 --> 03:31:25,058
All winner wins, winner wins.

5672
03:31:25,058 --> 03:31:26,425
All right, all right, all right.

5673
03:31:27,842 --> 03:31:29,276
Look, come a long way.

5674
03:31:29,276 --> 03:31:31,226
Ahmad, can you do a prediction?

5675
03:31:31,226 --> 03:31:33,026
Oh, my. God. I am so.

5676
03:31:33,026 --> 03:31:35,160
My hands are so fucked.

5677
03:31:35,160 --> 03:31:37,227
Holy shit. Oh, yeah.

5678
03:31:37,344 --> 03:31:38,127
All right.

5679
03:31:38,760 --> 03:31:39,060
Dudes.

5680
03:31:39,060 --> 03:31:41,878
When you started laughing,
I started, like, flipping you.

What are you doing? asshole?

5808
03:36:53,404 --> 03:36:55,471
I'm trusting him to bang

03:36:58,088 --> 03:37:00,305
on this guy's face. Oh.

03:37:03,006 --> 03:37:03,506
Oh, my God.

I hope.
I thought I had to help him for second.

5812
03:37:06,190 --> 03:37:08,257
I can't believe he's asking me to tap
more shit.

5813
03:37:08,823 --> 03:37:10,807
My fingers are so dead.

5814

It was.

5820
03:37:24,425 --> 03:37:25,209
Oh, I think we do that.

03:38:03,114 --> 03:38:03,631
He's inside.

5841
03:38:03,631 --> 03:38:05,915
I'm going to go into the other elevator.

5842
03:38:07,198 --> 03:38:08,948
I'll meet him down there.

5843
03:38:09,815 --> 03:38:10,749
You have to go up. Yeah.

03:38:10,749 --> 03:38:11,999
Upwards. Upwards.

03:38:32,735 --> 03:38:33,368
Oh, my God.

5852

03:38:48,787 --> 03:38:50,221
aerialists, aerial.

5861
03:38:50,221 --> 03:38:52,104
What is it?

5862
03:38:52,104 --> 03:38:53,438
Not like the finger on your nipples.

5863
03:38:53,438 --> 03:38:56,005
Yes, it is down.

5864
03:38:57,005 --> 03:39:00,656
And yet you don't know what a a body is.

5865
03:39:02,222 --> 03:39:04,890
Well, Arriola, it's a tag.

5866
03:39:04,890 --> 03:39:06,506
It's a tag.

5867
03:39:07,173 --> 03:39:09,390
What's really

5868
03:39:09,624 --> 03:39:11,007
the more you know

5869
03:39:13,557 --> 03:39:15,091
where why am I moving so slow?

5870
03:39:15,091 --> 03:39:16,891
Where is this fucker?

5871
03:39:16,975 --> 03:39:17,825
Show yourself.

5872
03:39:17,825 --> 03:39:20,125
Let's look around.
OK, this. Is probably hiding in here.

5873
03:39:20,408 --> 03:39:21,158
Oh, look.

5874
03:39:21,158 --> 03:39:23,275
It's like a reference to that one image.

5875
03:39:24,276 --> 03:39:25,709
Can we push them?

5876
03:39:26,276 --> 03:39:28,059
What's all?

5877
03:39:28,059 --> 03:39:29,076
What is that?

5878
03:39:29,076 --> 03:39:31,260
Ah, alcohol.

5879
03:39:31,260 --> 03:39:33,143
It's alcohol. Hey.

5880
03:39:33,143 --> 03:39:34,860
This looks so. Dangerous, by the way.

5881
03:39:34,860 --> 03:39:37,327
Like,
I can't imagine doing this enough. Yeah.

5882
03:39:37,677 --> 03:39:39,211
Oh, my God, he's. No. Oh, no.

5883
03:39:40,745 --> 03:39:41,645
He's here.

5884
03:39:42,245 --> 03:39:43,378
Oh, my God.

5885
03:39:43,562 --> 03:39:45,895
Help me bust it open. OK, ok.

5886
03:39:45,895 --> 03:39:46,679

5887
03:39:48,096 --> 03:39:48,846
You ready? Yeah.

Go. Nice, nice.

03:39:52,980 --> 03:39:55,047
Easy gig. Set me out.

5891
03:39:55,047 --> 03:39:56,880
You got that piece of shit.

5892
03:39:56,880 --> 03:39:58,447
I'm going to kill you.

5893
03:39:58,764 --> 03:39:59,664
Oh, my God.

5894
03:39:59,664 --> 03:40:02,198
Don't you have a gun?
Why can't we just shoot him?

5895
03:40:02,198 --> 03:40:02,764
He's not in line.

5896
03:40:02,764 --> 03:40:05,648
Of sight, is he? OK,

5897
03:40:06,615 --> 03:40:09,365

5898
03:40:09,882 --> 03:40:10,632

I'll bring you over.

5906
03:40:22,167 --> 03:40:23,617
Wow, this is so majestic.

5907
03:40:23,617 --> 03:40:25,284
Holy shit. Hurry up.

5908
03:40:25,284 --> 03:40:25,951
Wait, the.

03:40:25,951 --> 03:40:27,451
All right, we're timed. We're timed.

5910
03:40:27,451 --> 03:40:29,135
Hold up. Go.

5911
03:40:29,135 --> 03:40:29,701
OK. OK, ok.

5912
03:40:29,701 --> 03:40:32,285
So, you know, I don't see him anywhere.

5913
03:40:32,585 --> 03:40:33,669
I don't know where you went.

5914
03:40:33,669 --> 03:40:35,936
Keep.
Look, he's got to be up there. Somewhere.

5915
03:40:37,469 --> 03:40:39,303
He's going to jump me right now by you.

5916
03:40:39,303 --> 03:40:41,970
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

5917
03:40:41,970 --> 03:40:44,287
Why is there an axe? What?

5918
03:40:44,287 --> 03:40:46,570

All right, I'll chase.

5921
03:40:50,671 --> 03:40:52,471
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

5922
03:40:52,805 --> 03:40:54,538
I'm on his ass.

5923
03:40:54,838 --> 03:40:55,955
I see him. I see him.

5924
03:40:55,955 --> 03:40:57,572
Stop. Crane,

5925
03:40:58,022 --> 03:40:59,756

5926
03:41:00,539 --> 03:41:01,989
I got to shake him off.

5927
03:41:04,506 --> 03:41:05,006
Yeah.

5928
03:41:05,006 --> 03:41:07,207
Oh, my God. This is dangerous.

5929
03:41:07,357 --> 03:41:09,174
This is really bad, dude.

03:41:09,174 --> 03:41:11,607
I don't know.

5931
03:41:11,607 --> 03:41:13,024
You know, afraid of heights.

5932
03:41:13,024 --> 03:41:14,258
Oh, my God. He's, like, down on this.

5933
03:41:14,258 --> 03:41:16,058
Move all the way. On the thing.

What the hell?

5935
03:41:17,408 --> 03:41:18,625
This guy's crazy.

5936
03:41:18,625 --> 03:41:19,775

5937
03:41:19,775 --> 03:41:20,559

Get him, get him, get you. Get him bitch.

5942
03:41:33,627 --> 03:41:34,194
I'm on my way.

5943
03:41:34,194 --> 03:41:34,977
I'm almost there.

5944
03:41:34,977 --> 03:41:36,777
I'll jump down from top.

5945
03:41:36,777 --> 03:41:38,994

5963
03:42:04,798 --> 03:42:05,882

I'm going to die. I'm going to die.

5972
03:42:20,917 --> 03:42:22,351
Oh, no, Mysta.

I think I messed up. I got you.

5975
03:42:27,568 --> 03:42:29,168
Go. What?

5976
03:42:29,168 --> 03:42:29,818
Oh, God.

Oh, my. God.

5978
03:42:30,418 --> 03:42:32,185
Oh, my God. I'm so tired of him.

5979
03:42:32,185 --> 03:42:34,469
I'm so tired of him.

5980
03:42:34,469 --> 03:42:35,702
This fucking guy.

5981
03:42:35,702 --> 03:42:37,986
This guy is the fastest man alive.

5982
03:42:38,919 --> 03:42:40,586
Our perspectives.

5983
03:42:40,586 --> 03:42:41,437
Yeah. This perspective.

5984
03:42:41,437 --> 03:42:42,937
OK, I'm up here.

03:42:45,604 --> 03:42:46,387
Oh, we got him.

03:42:46,387 --> 03:42:48,688
Yeah, that's nice.

5988
03:42:48,688 --> 03:42:51,455
Holly Foxx gets her hands off me.

5989
03:42:54,838 --> 03:42:56,855
Hands all the way too long then.

5990
03:42:57,455 --> 03:42:59,939
Oh, my God. Dude is. Slippery.

5991
03:43:00,189 --> 03:43:04,523
It's like GTA I got it.

5992
03:43:05,573 --> 03:43:06,773
Hasn't even been an hour.

5993
03:43:06,773 --> 03:43:08,040
What the fuck are you talking about?

5994
03:43:08,040 --> 03:43:09,724
Recycling glass.

5995
03:43:11,557 --> 03:43:14,074
So tell me where Harvey. Is.

5996
03:43:15,208 --> 03:43:17,608
Fuck you. I ain't telling you shit.

Oh, whoa. Look at this.

6000
03:43:22,776 --> 03:43:24,176
Oh, God.

6001
03:43:24,176 --> 03:43:26,860
Oh, I wonder what you could do
with this shoe.

6002
03:43:26,860 --> 03:43:29,127
Each one of.
His kneecaps and a shoe his feet.

6003
03:43:29,543 --> 03:43:29,977
For now.

6004
03:43:31,644 --> 03:43:32,460
Making him talk.

6005
03:43:32,460 --> 03:43:33,094
You know.

6006
03:43:33,094 --> 03:43:33,877
I don't know about you,

6007
03:43:33,877 --> 03:43:36,694
but I see a lot of different things here
that could make this guy talk.

6008
03:43:37,194 --> 03:43:38,278
What do you say?

6009
03:43:38,645 --> 03:43:41,478
Feet I've got feet,
and then they can shove.

6010
03:43:41,912 --> 03:43:42,512
Yeah, just.

6011
03:43:42,512 --> 03:43:44,545
Just put his feet to fill in this face.

6012
03:43:45,295 --> 03:43:47,246
Oh, we had to torture him.

6013
03:43:47,246 --> 03:43:47,946
Yeah. Yeah.

6014
03:43:47,946 --> 03:43:48,996
Oh, this is fun.

6015
03:43:48,996 --> 03:43:51,213
Way crowbar now.

6016
03:43:51,213 --> 03:43:53,280
Oh, nail gun.

6017
03:43:53,280 --> 03:43:56,097
Oh, I got a lamp. To get a real shock.

03:43:56,097 --> 03:43:56,580
Oh, I'm going to.

6019
03:43:56,580 --> 03:43:57,897

6020
03:43:57,897 --> 03:44:00,698
You're going to talk a lot

6021
03:44:00,864 --> 03:44:01,948
How about this?

6022
03:44:01,948 --> 03:44:03,965
Oh. Oh, yeah.

6023
03:44:03,965 --> 03:44:06,898
You like that

6024
03:44:07,015 --> 03:44:07,715

Oh, I am you can put the light in my eye.

6026
03:44:11,366 --> 03:44:12,666
Is that your bright idea?

6027
03:44:12,666 --> 03:44:14,666
Is that my bright idea? Smart ass.

6028
03:44:15,300 --> 03:44:17,767
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

6029
03:44:17,767 --> 03:44:19,767
You think he likes it?
I think he likes it.

6030
03:44:20,067 --> 03:44:21,567
Wait a second now.

6031
03:44:21,567 --> 03:44:23,251
Oh, yeah, I think he like that.

6032
03:44:24,384 --> 03:44:25,318
I'll try to blow top.

6033
03:44:25,318 --> 03:44:26,468
Damn it.

6034
03:44:27,568 --> 03:44:28,868
Oh, that's. Huh?

6035
03:44:28,868 --> 03:44:29,318
Your face.

6036
03:44:29,318 --> 03:44:30,568
His won't start talking.

6037
03:44:30,568 --> 03:44:32,319
Fuck you. Fuck me, huh?

6038
03:44:32,319 --> 03:44:33,336
How about the dick? Whoa.

6039
03:44:33,336 --> 03:44:35,486
No, no, not the dick. Oh.

6040
03:44:36,319 --> 03:44:37,136
Oh, my God.

6041
03:44:37,136 --> 03:44:39,536
Oh, dude, why are we doing this stock?

6042
03:44:40,436 --> 03:44:42,003
I don't think this is right.

6043
03:44:42,003 --> 03:44:43,620
Ha ha ha ha.

6044
03:44:43,920 --> 03:44:44,437
What the fuck is.

6045
03:44:44,437 --> 03:44:46,654
I'm showing him his wallet.
Leave my family out of this.

6046
03:44:46,887 --> 03:44:48,538
All entirely up to you.

6047
03:44:48,538 --> 03:44:49,771
Don't you fucking touch them.

6048
03:44:49,771 --> 03:44:50,938
They have nothing to do with this.

6049
03:44:50,938 --> 03:44:53,105
Oh. Then start talking.

6050
03:44:54,388 --> 03:44:55,689
He's still not talking.

6051
03:44:55,689 --> 03:44:56,822
All right, guys.

6052
03:44:56,822 --> 03:44:58,439
All right, I think the family did it.

6053
03:44:58,439 --> 03:45:00,056
I'll tell you what. You what?

6054
03:45:00,056 --> 03:45:01,173
I know I wanted to shoot him.

6055
03:45:01,173 --> 03:45:03,273
Yeah, start talking then.

6056
03:45:03,340 --> 03:45:05,573
All right,
all right, calm down. Calm down.

6057
03:45:06,307 --> 03:45:08,190
Somewhere we don't get the shooter.

6058
03:45:08,190 --> 03:45:10,441
I don't know where exactly,
but he's in Mexico.

6059
03:45:10,474 --> 03:45:11,124
I think you do.

6060
03:45:11,124 --> 03:45:14,108
Maybe want to get info in there. Hmm?

6061
03:45:14,191 --> 03:45:15,008
I swear.

6062
03:45:15,008 --> 03:45:17,525
So that's where the rat is hiding.
Oh, yeah.

6063
03:45:17,525 --> 03:45:18,759
That's where he is.

6064
03:45:18,759 --> 03:45:21,026
Don't tell him I told you.
You don't tell me what to do.

6065
03:45:21,176 --> 03:45:21,692
All right.

6066
03:45:21,692 --> 03:45:22,142
All right.

6067
03:45:22,142 --> 03:45:24,326
I'll see you later. Damn right.

6068
03:45:24,359 --> 03:45:26,410
Let's go, guys. Yeah.

6069
03:45:26,410 --> 03:45:29,243
What's I'm going to shoot him.

6070
03:45:29,243 --> 03:45:30,727
You're crazy. Untie me.

6071
03:45:30,727 --> 03:45:32,344
No, come back.

6072
03:45:33,594 --> 03:45:34,327
You know.

6073
03:45:34,327 --> 03:45:36,328
The whole electric shock and him moaning.

6074
03:45:36,328 --> 03:45:38,695
They're really just.

6075
03:45:39,728 --> 03:45:43,279
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

6076
03:45:43,329 --> 03:45:43,829
Mexico.

6077
03:45:43,829 --> 03:45:47,463
Then we got an electric shock too far.

6078
03:45:47,579 --> 03:45:49,496
That's probably a good idea.

6079
03:45:49,746 --> 03:45:52,747
I'm telling you,
the nipple idea is like this.

6080
03:45:52,747 --> 03:45:54,597
Incredible. Wait.

6081
03:45:54,597 --> 03:45:55,380
Step aside.

6082
03:45:55,380 --> 03:45:56,997
Are you speaking from experience? Or.

6083
03:45:56,997 --> 03:45:58,947
No, I'm not speaking from experience.

6084
03:45:58,947 --> 03:45:59,514
I'm just.

6085
03:45:59,514 --> 03:46:01,715
You like,
if there's a way to, like, experience it

6086
03:46:01,715 --> 03:46:03,848
for the first time,
it's probably that one.

6087
03:46:03,848 --> 03:46:05,915
Hmm. My only concept of it.

6088
03:46:05,915 --> 03:46:07,882
All right, there you go.

6089
03:46:08,165 --> 03:46:09,066
Come on, record it.

6090
03:46:09,066 --> 03:46:09,782
Yeah.

6091
03:46:13,299 --> 03:46:15,767
Like the nipple.

6092
03:46:16,017 --> 03:46:18,367
Contact that might like.

6093
03:46:18,367 --> 03:46:21,834
If I electrocute your nipples.

6094
03:46:21,834 --> 03:46:22,617
Can we record. It?

6095
03:46:22,617 --> 03:46:23,584
That's good.

6096
03:46:24,368 --> 03:46:26,635
I got a record. Why get those gone, then?

6097
03:46:26,635 --> 03:46:28,735
The nipple gang shocks you.

6098
03:46:28,735 --> 03:46:29,935
Yeah.

6099
03:46:31,085 --> 03:46:33,352
I mean, you can't
risk robbing it like. No.

6100
03:46:34,669 --> 03:46:37,119
There
are ways other places to rob the banks.

6101
03:46:37,136 --> 03:46:38,786
You know.
I just want to see you go. Like what?

6102
03:46:38,786 --> 03:46:41,637
Oh, yeah, I guess maybe.

6103
03:46:41,637 --> 03:46:44,671
You know, I'm sure you don't.

6104
03:46:44,854 --> 03:46:47,254
Like the whole class.

6105
03:46:48,638 --> 03:46:49,321
As long as.

6106
03:46:49,321 --> 03:46:50,588
As long as you do the same.

6107
03:46:50,588 --> 03:46:53,255
OK, right?
Yeah, I'll use it. This Clemson.

6108
03:46:53,438 --> 03:46:55,439
Pinky promise. Promise, promise. School.

6109
03:46:55,955 --> 03:46:58,289
I pinky promise.

6110
03:46:58,706 --> 03:46:59,673
Good boy.

6111
03:47:00,606 --> 03:47:03,306
Roy and Rogers.

6112
03:47:03,657 --> 03:47:06,507
Rogers Hogg, his.

6113
03:47:07,074 --> 03:47:08,407
Voice is stronger.

6114
03:47:08,407 --> 03:47:09,991
You think they'll have enough money?

6115
03:47:09,991 --> 03:47:11,008
They better have.

6116
03:47:11,008 --> 03:47:14,008
I'm not going after Harvey
with just a handgun.

6117
03:47:14,008 --> 03:47:15,175
Well, yes.

6118
03:47:15,175 --> 03:47:17,258
There's only one way to find.

6119
03:47:17,258 --> 03:47:18,325
OK, then.

6120
03:47:18,992 --> 03:47:20,309
You ready? Yeah.

6121
03:47:20,309 --> 03:47:22,059
Why don't you give me the gun?

6122
03:47:22,059 --> 03:47:22,959
What do you mean?

6123
03:47:23,043 --> 03:47:25,360
Look, we need to keep a low profile.

6124
03:47:25,360 --> 03:47:26,826
That's not really your thing.

6125
03:47:26,826 --> 03:47:29,227
I say we do this
the best way, man. Just in and. Out.

6126
03:47:29,277 --> 03:47:33,144
Why is Leo always, like, default
to the most chaotic option possible?

6127
03:47:33,294 --> 03:47:34,928
Well, I don't like easy.

6128
03:47:34,928 --> 03:47:35,694
Look at that.

6129
03:47:35,694 --> 03:47:37,895
Oh, it's like you should. Keep the gun.

6130
03:47:38,945 --> 03:47:39,478
Vincent.

6131
03:47:39,478 --> 03:47:41,695
You don't like it? Fine.
You can keep the gun. I'm OK with that.

6132
03:47:42,129 --> 03:47:45,246
Just make sure nobody gets hurt.

6133
03:47:45,579 --> 03:47:46,296
Kiki.

6134
03:47:47,079 --> 03:47:48,930
Don't
you think I'd do anything part of it?

6135
03:47:48,930 --> 03:47:51,330
I mean, I think. Trust me.

6136
03:47:51,697 --> 03:47:55,047
I think your fingers
are still a little shaky, so I don't know.

6137
03:47:55,347 --> 03:47:56,314
It's all yours.

6138
03:47:56,314 --> 03:47:57,247
Yeah, but.

6139
03:47:57,247 --> 03:47:58,898
But. Hey,

6140
03:47:59,314 --> 03:48:01,415
hey, listen, listen.

6141
03:48:01,415 --> 03:48:03,482
I'm good. I'm good with my fingers.

6142
03:48:04,148 --> 03:48:05,198
That's a lie.

6143
03:48:05,198 --> 03:48:07,599
I mean, obviously.

6144
03:48:07,599 --> 03:48:08,699
Are you kidding me?

6145
03:48:08,699 --> 03:48:10,799
Are you kidding me?

6146
03:48:11,549 --> 03:48:12,700
What did I tell you?

6147
03:48:12,700 --> 03:48:14,967
What did I tell you, little man?

6148
03:48:14,967 --> 03:48:17,484
A guy's got to do
what a guy's got to do to the register.

6149
03:48:17,700 --> 03:48:18,784
So fucking open. It.

6150
03:48:18,784 --> 03:48:20,767
Oh, my God. I can take you anywhere.

6151
03:48:20,767 --> 03:48:23,218
Any cash in the register open. Hey.

6152
03:48:25,618 --> 03:48:26,335
I'm going to cash.

6153
03:48:26,335 --> 03:48:28,802
One more. Word from you. Sit down. Shit.

6154
03:48:29,369 --> 03:48:30,452
Now stay there.

6155
03:48:30,452 --> 03:48:32,186
What? Shut up. All right. All right.

6156
03:48:33,202 --> 03:48:35,336
OK. Hey, Benson.

6157
03:48:35,336 --> 03:48:37,353
There should be safe around here
somewhere.

6158
03:48:37,420 --> 03:48:39,837
I'm only. I'm just making safe.

6159
03:48:39,837 --> 03:48:43,170
I'm making sure that people can't get away
and making sure people don't get away.

6160
03:48:43,704 --> 03:48:45,871
Stop it. Mysta. Mysta.

6161
03:48:46,388 --> 03:48:47,554
Mysta. I'm just.

6162
03:48:47,554 --> 03:48:49,938
Scaring them. OK. OK, i'm going back.

6163
03:48:49,955 --> 03:48:51,038
I'm going back.

6164
03:48:51,055 --> 03:48:53,389
Oh, let me go.

6165
03:48:53,389 --> 03:48:55,439
Benson, let him go.

6166
03:48:55,556 --> 03:48:57,923
The safe.
Is that your fucking piece of shit?

6167
03:48:57,939 --> 03:48:59,456
What the fuck was that?

6168
03:48:59,456 --> 03:49:01,123
What? Let's go. Wait.

6169
03:49:01,123 --> 03:49:02,123
The lady. The lady.

6170
03:49:02,123 --> 03:49:03,157
The lady, Mysta..

6171
03:49:03,157 --> 03:49:06,207
The lady Mysta. Lady,

6172
03:49:06,357 --> 03:49:07,174
don't shoot.

6173
03:49:07,174 --> 03:49:10,208
Give me the gun. Don't move.

6174
03:49:10,208 --> 03:49:11,724
Oh. Oh, shit.

6175
03:49:11,724 --> 03:49:13,675
All right, I'll go and stay here.

6176
03:49:13,675 --> 03:49:14,258
All right.

6177
03:49:14,258 --> 03:49:16,408
It's locked. We need the combination.

6178
03:49:16,408 --> 03:49:18,509
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

6179
03:49:18,509 --> 03:49:21,009
You know, a lady got out, by the way,
she came out of the store.

6180
03:49:21,926 --> 03:49:23,860
Really? Yeah. She got out.

6181
03:49:23,860 --> 03:49:25,743
I don't know if that's important or not.

6182
03:49:25,743 --> 03:49:27,960
No, I'm fine. Nobody move.

6183
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:29,244
Damn it.

6184
03:49:29,244 --> 03:49:31,794
Why do we find
that? Why would we find that?

6185
03:49:35,878 --> 03:49:36,728
Fuck.

6186
03:49:36,728 --> 03:49:38,578
Maybe there's something here in the room.

6187
03:49:38,578 --> 03:49:40,262
Is this guy dead?

6188
03:49:40,545 --> 03:49:42,279
Oh, I think so. But it's fine.

6189
03:49:42,279 --> 03:49:44,129
He didn't have a family.

6190
03:49:44,312 --> 03:49:45,479
We need to have a code.

6191
03:49:45,479 --> 03:49:47,730
Yeah, we have to find the code somewhere.
What's the code?

6192
03:49:47,830 --> 03:49:49,113
Where's the code?

6193
03:49:49,113 --> 03:49:51,180
Maybe it's written down.

6194
03:49:51,180 --> 03:49:52,764
Lady, what's the code?

6195
03:49:52,764 --> 03:49:54,414
We need the combination.

6196
03:49:54,414 --> 03:49:56,214
I don't have it. Oh.

6197
03:49:56,214 --> 03:49:57,214
What's going on?

6198
03:49:57,214 --> 03:49:58,948
Calm down. Calm down.

6199
03:49:58,948 --> 03:50:00,898
I'm going to.

6200
03:50:00,898 --> 03:50:02,365
Just give me the combination.

6201
03:50:02,365 --> 03:50:03,248
Oh, no. They know.

6202
03:50:03,248 --> 03:50:04,499
They know yet.

6203
03:50:04,499 --> 03:50:06,799
Are they OK? Yes. Yes, OK. OK.

6204
03:50:07,382 --> 03:50:14,367
13713713721 is all we know.

6205
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:15,267
Oh, my God. He's coming.

6206
03:50:15,267 --> 03:50:17,550
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.

6207
03:50:18,901 --> 03:50:22,418
Seven open grab bag.

6208
03:50:22,418 --> 03:50:24,635
Grab gun was like $5.

6209
03:50:25,501 --> 03:50:27,085
We do that for five bucks.

6210
03:50:27,085 --> 03:50:29,369
Are you kidding me? Get out of here.

6211
03:50:31,919 --> 03:50:33,519
Whose idea was this?

6212
03:50:33,519 --> 03:50:34,169
Nobody move.

6213
03:50:34,169 --> 03:50:34,986
It was your idea.

6214
03:50:34,986 --> 03:50:37,120
You walked in with your toe on your knees.

6215
03:50:37,253 --> 03:50:39,953
Oh, my God. We fucked off.

6216
03:50:39,953 --> 03:50:40,637
Rebecca.

6217
03:50:40,637 --> 03:50:43,054
Oh, well, do we actually lose?

6218
03:50:43,104 --> 03:50:45,154
Yeah, we lost.

6219
03:50:45,938 --> 03:50:46,288
Oh, my God.

6220
03:50:46,288 --> 03:50:47,971
That wasn't even part of it. OK, did.

6221
03:50:47,971 --> 03:50:50,005
You watch the class?
You might make a move.

6222
03:50:50,972 --> 03:50:53,139
Sure. Watch the clerks.

6223
03:50:53,139 --> 03:50:53,905
Yeah, I'm watching her.

6224
03:50:53,905 --> 03:50:55,772
I'm going to watch her. Hey.

6225
03:50:56,706 --> 03:50:57,273
Don't move.

6226
03:50:57,273 --> 03:50:58,356
You get the gun, ok?

6227
03:50:58,356 --> 03:50:59,406
It's 137.

6228
03:50:59,406 --> 03:51:00,056
It's one through seven.

6229
03:51:00,056 --> 03:51:00,956
Marquesa, right?

6230
03:51:00,956 --> 03:51:04,574
OK, this guy, we just got to be fast.

6231
03:51:04,824 --> 03:51:07,157
This lock, we need a combination.
I got it. I got it.

6232
03:51:07,407 --> 03:51:09,758
I got. Three.

6233
03:51:09,758 --> 03:51:10,691
I don't.

6234
03:51:10,691 --> 03:51:12,175
Seven. Got it open.

6235
03:51:12,175 --> 03:51:14,192
OK, I grabbing.

6236
03:51:14,675 --> 03:51:15,308
Got it.

6237
03:51:15,308 --> 03:51:17,975
Let's go get him. I get him. I get away.

6238
03:51:17,975 --> 03:51:18,759
Why do we do.

6239
03:51:18,759 --> 03:51:21,159
That for just like,
such a small amount of cash.

6240
03:51:22,326 --> 03:51:24,176
But broke, man, we're broke.

6241
03:51:24,176 --> 03:51:25,260
Oh, my God.

6242
03:51:25,260 --> 03:51:27,627
This is so drama.

6243
03:51:28,677 --> 03:51:30,094
Get in the car. Get in the car.

6244
03:51:30,094 --> 03:51:32,461
I could do it.

6245
03:51:32,461 --> 03:51:34,261
You're driving now.

6246
03:51:35,128 --> 03:51:37,678
OK? I'm an excellent driver.

6247
03:51:41,612 --> 03:51:43,829
OK? Oh, that was easy.

6248
03:51:43,879 --> 03:51:45,363
So fucking dumb.

6249
03:51:45,363 --> 03:51:48,513
All that's. The are.

6250
03:51:48,513 --> 03:51:51,213
Make sure to bring the goods, ok?

6251
03:51:51,630 --> 03:51:53,614
Yeah, I know where that is.

6252
03:51:53,664 --> 03:51:54,447
Got it.

6253
03:51:54,481 --> 03:51:56,764
He just walked into
the stores are shooting everywhere.

6254
03:51:57,898 --> 03:51:59,948
Yeah. As to make a statement.

6255
03:51:59,948 --> 03:52:01,348
We got the guns.

6256
03:52:01,348 --> 03:52:03,749
So they don't do anything stupid.

6257
03:52:03,749 --> 03:52:04,649
I do.

6258
03:52:04,649 --> 03:52:06,866
Stop worrying,
Vincent. It's not good for your heart.

6259
03:52:07,199 --> 03:52:09,716
Yeah. Stop worrying, bitch.

6260
03:52:09,716 --> 03:52:11,800
I just want to know what we're dealing
with.

6261
03:52:11,800 --> 03:52:13,267
Relax, Mysta. Paranoia.

6262
03:52:13,267 --> 03:52:15,083
I trust her, OK?

6263
03:52:15,083 --> 03:52:17,250
Besides, she owes me one OK.

6264
03:52:17,367 --> 03:52:20,068
Let's talk about. Your gun. Celia.

6265
03:52:20,968 --> 03:52:22,951
Yeah. Relax, Mom. All right?

6266
03:52:22,951 --> 03:52:25,652
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You relax. Yeah.

6267
03:52:25,685 --> 03:52:26,818
You're either alive.

6268
03:52:26,818 --> 03:52:29,069
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

6269
03:52:29,069 --> 03:52:31,953
Thomas Oh. StarWars.

6270
03:52:32,219 --> 03:52:33,069
What do you mean?

6271
03:52:33,069 --> 03:52:36,086
I've never watched starwars. Same what?

6272
03:52:36,120 --> 03:52:36,620
You think

6273
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:39,404
that.

6274
03:52:41,004 --> 03:52:43,237
Oh, that's a cool car.

6275
03:52:43,237 --> 03:52:44,371
Hot lady.

6276
03:52:47,671 --> 03:52:51,639
OK, hello.

6277
03:52:53,039 --> 03:52:54,572
See, she got floral pattern.

6278
03:52:54,572 --> 03:52:55,956
Still, she knows where.

6279
03:52:55,956 --> 03:52:58,290
She owns. It, and she she works on it.

6280
03:52:58,290 --> 03:52:59,290
You don't.

6281
03:52:59,290 --> 03:53:01,290
I'm going to shoot your. But she. Left.

6282
03:53:01,290 --> 03:53:03,474
But she's my beloved jacket. No.

6283
03:53:03,807 --> 03:53:04,740
What is that?

6284
03:53:04,740 --> 03:53:06,307
You have no drip.

6285
03:53:06,307 --> 03:53:08,308
Don't want you. OK, that's.

6286
03:53:08,724 --> 03:53:10,708
You're your hands.

6287
03:53:10,708 --> 03:53:12,542
Look, I'm Vincent.

6288
03:53:12,542 --> 03:53:13,142
Oh, hello.

6289
03:53:13,142 --> 03:53:15,842
OK, that's too far to meet you.
What the fuck, man?

6290
03:53:15,875 --> 03:53:18,242
Oh, you're a fucking idiot.

6291
03:53:19,676 --> 03:53:20,459
What?

6292
03:53:20,459 --> 03:53:23,793
Why don't you bring your whole family
next time I'm out?

6293
03:53:24,360 --> 03:53:25,493
What's wrong?

6294
03:53:26,677 --> 03:53:28,260
What's wrong with me?

6295
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:30,177
What the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah.

6296
03:53:30,177 --> 03:53:32,844
You tell him what the fuck is wrong,
you hear?

6297
03:53:32,844 --> 03:53:33,661
I want ice cream.

6298
03:53:33,661 --> 03:53:36,995
I told you,
I don't do business with strangers.

6299
03:53:36,995 --> 03:53:39,879
And this guy,
he looks like a stranger to me.

6300
03:53:39,879 --> 03:53:41,129
You don't know me.

6301
03:53:41,129 --> 03:53:42,929
Do you have a problem with me? Yeah.

6302
03:53:44,013 --> 03:53:44,379
Yeah.

6303
03:53:44,379 --> 03:53:47,046
I got no wrong with me.

6304
03:53:48,146 --> 03:53:49,680
You have big earrings, Vince.

6305
03:53:49,680 --> 03:53:51,747
I can handle it.
I can handle it. Don't worry.

6306
03:53:51,930 --> 03:53:53,547
I got this I want to see.

6307
03:53:53,547 --> 03:53:55,114
I'm just going to look at these birds over
here.

6308
03:53:55,114 --> 03:53:56,864
Wow. Look at these birds flying around.

6309
03:53:56,864 --> 03:53:59,631
Star, look at him. Huh?

6310
03:54:00,932 --> 03:54:01,798
Oh, is that OK?

6311
03:54:01,798 --> 03:54:03,632
There's a lot of sexual tension here.

6312
03:54:03,632 --> 03:54:06,216
I don't know. Oh,

6313
03:54:06,332 --> 03:54:07,649
I like the clouds.

6314
03:54:07,649 --> 03:54:08,283
Why is nothing.

6315
03:54:08,283 --> 03:54:10,966
Oh, my g something. Yes.
You have to do something.

6316
03:54:10,966 --> 03:54:21,868
You OK.

6317
03:54:23,068 --> 03:54:24,268
Here you go.

6318
03:54:28,135 --> 03:54:31,203
OK, this is this is acting it.

6319
03:54:31,269 --> 03:54:33,369
Disarms the gun, so you can't.
She can't use it.

6320
03:54:33,603 --> 03:54:35,736
Let's just go, then we'll be out of here.

6321
03:54:35,753 --> 03:54:38,287
Yeah, time. OK.

6322
03:54:40,704 --> 03:54:42,121
OK, Jasmine.

6323
03:54:42,121 --> 03:54:44,138
It's five bucks.

6324
03:54:44,138 --> 03:54:44,671
Are those.

6325
03:54:44,671 --> 03:54:45,988
Those are benjamins.

6326
03:54:45,988 --> 03:54:47,888
Where are you talking about? Five bucks?

6327
03:54:47,888 --> 03:54:49,588
Well, what's up? Benjamin?

6328
03:54:49,588 --> 03:54:54,122
Those are hundred dollar bills each dime.

6329
03:54:54,389 --> 03:54:55,389
That's actually a lot of guns.

6330
03:54:58,506 --> 03:55:00,307
OK, I want them.

6331
03:55:00,307 --> 03:55:01,473
I want one till.

6332
03:55:01,473 --> 03:55:02,124
You get the.

6333
03:55:02,190 --> 03:55:04,257
Gun. Fuck off.

6334
03:55:04,257 --> 03:55:05,824
Ellen. The assault rifle.

6335
03:55:05,824 --> 03:55:08,858
OK? I don't want that. Anyways,

6336
03:55:08,858 --> 03:55:09,991
let me see.

6337
03:55:10,375 --> 03:55:11,758
Which one do I want?

6338
03:55:11,758 --> 03:55:12,242
What is that?

6339
03:55:12,242 --> 03:55:16,025
Back there is a hunting rifle.

6340
03:55:17,009 --> 03:55:18,509
Is a shotgun.

6341
03:55:18,509 --> 03:55:22,010
Shotguns are always great
after hunting N14.

6342
03:55:22,560 --> 03:55:22,860
All right.

6343
03:55:22,860 --> 03:55:26,344
Packs quite a proboscis.

6344
03:55:26,344 --> 03:55:27,594
And a good place for target.

6345
03:55:27,594 --> 03:55:29,461
Practise around here.

6346
03:55:29,461 --> 03:55:31,528
Try shooting at those empty houses.

6347
03:55:31,528 --> 03:55:33,778
That should do the trick. Good idea.

6348
03:55:33,778 --> 03:55:35,828
Oh, are you? Shoot this bad boy.

6349
03:55:35,828 --> 03:55:36,845
Fuck,

6350
03:55:37,445 --> 03:55:40,029
fuck, fuck.

6351
03:55:40,045 --> 03:55:42,746
Oh, no. OK, ok. I got it.

6352
03:55:42,996 --> 03:55:43,946
Thank you.

6353
03:55:43,979 --> 03:55:46,146
Oh, you crazy friends.

6354
03:55:46,146 --> 03:55:49,530
This is the valley drinking from the wash.

6355
03:55:49,530 --> 03:55:50,430
Thank you.

6356
03:55:50,847 --> 03:55:53,514
Impressive. Vincent, you're cheating.

6357
03:55:53,514 --> 03:55:54,581
What do you mean, I'm cheating?

6358
03:55:54,581 --> 03:55:55,681
You're hacking.

6359
03:55:55,681 --> 03:55:57,265
What do you mean, I'm cheating?

6360
03:55:57,265 --> 03:55:59,048
You're locking on.

6361
03:55:59,048 --> 03:56:00,148
No, I'm not.

6362
03:56:00,148 --> 03:56:02,165
It's called good aim, motherfucker.

6363
03:56:02,615 --> 03:56:05,499
What is this? OK, get. It next time.

6364
03:56:06,866 --> 03:56:08,616
You ever heard of lobs?

6365
03:56:08,616 --> 03:56:10,066
No, no, no.

6366
03:56:10,066 --> 03:56:12,300
No. Okay, well, thank you.

6367
03:56:12,450 --> 03:56:13,133
That's bullshit.

6368
03:56:13,133 --> 03:56:15,300
Did the sample schedule just match?

6369
03:56:15,834 --> 03:56:18,301
Who? You're just talking

6370
03:56:19,018 --> 03:56:21,335
to. Just do our role.

6371
03:56:21,335 --> 03:56:23,918
We answer those. Call

6372
03:56:24,602 --> 03:56:26,319
this is a. Bus assault rifle.

6373
03:56:26,319 --> 03:56:27,385
I hate this shit.

6374
03:56:27,385 --> 03:56:29,469
Yeah, I like this gun. I'm happy with it.

6375
03:56:29,936 --> 03:56:30,419
I want.

6376
03:56:30,419 --> 03:56:31,836
I want a submachine gun.

6377
03:56:31,836 --> 03:56:33,870
This is the perfect place for Target.

6378
03:56:33,870 --> 03:56:34,203
This one.

6379
03:56:34,203 --> 03:56:36,720
This feels like.

6380
03:56:38,054 --> 03:56:38,737
Yeah, it's looking.

6381
03:56:38,737 --> 03:56:40,837
I was the lead

6382
03:56:41,554 --> 03:56:43,254
oh, yeah?

6383
03:56:43,254 --> 03:56:45,638
Yeah. That's them all. My style.

6384
03:56:46,138 --> 03:56:48,605
Yeah. OK.

6385
03:56:48,838 --> 03:56:49,622
Some of them.

6386
03:56:49,622 --> 03:56:50,522
My mama

6387
03:56:51,272 --> 03:56:52,989
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

6388
03:56:53,672 --> 03:56:54,606
blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah.

6389
03:56:54,606 --> 03:56:56,440
Oh, when was this?

6390
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:57,306
Give me a minute.

6391
03:56:57,306 --> 03:56:59,573
I want to make sure
I have the right weapon.

6392
03:56:59,573 --> 03:57:01,774
By this all.

6393
03:57:01,774 --> 03:57:03,324
It's more target practise. OK.

6394
03:57:06,058 --> 03:57:07,208
Cool.

6395
03:57:14,609 --> 03:57:16,559
You. You mind?

6396
03:57:16,559 --> 03:57:19,059
Are you missing all of them?

6397
03:57:19,059 --> 03:57:21,026
I missed all of them.

6398
03:57:23,693 --> 03:57:25,894
OK. I'm done.

6399
03:57:25,894 --> 03:57:26,827
Yeah, let's go.

6400
03:57:26,827 --> 03:57:29,277
I think I'm. Gone.

6401
03:57:29,594 --> 03:57:31,494
I will figure it out.

6402
03:57:31,494 --> 03:57:33,628
What? We wanted the fuck out.

6403
03:57:33,728 --> 03:57:36,512
I had those.
I had those. OK, I that. You hit those.

6404
03:57:36,512 --> 03:57:37,629
Do you really hit those?

6405
03:57:37,629 --> 03:57:39,662
Yes, I hit those.

6406
03:57:44,380 --> 03:57:45,296
OK, sir.

6407
03:57:45,296 --> 03:57:46,947
I time to shoot people.

6408
03:57:46,947 --> 03:57:47,847
I think

6409
03:57:50,314 --> 03:57:52,114
I buy

6410
03:57:53,498 --> 03:57:53,914
my wife.

6411
03:57:53,914 --> 03:57:55,298
She really does work it. Yeah.

6412
03:57:55,298 --> 03:57:57,415
She doesn't even say bye either.

6413
03:57:57,415 --> 03:57:58,982
I like what she's.

6414
03:57:58,982 --> 03:58:01,949
Girl bossing. Me.

6415
03:58:02,915 --> 03:58:04,599
I think so.

6416
03:58:06,416 --> 03:58:07,950
Why she looking at us like that?

6417
03:58:07,950 --> 03:58:10,650
Like we're going to see her again.

6418
03:58:12,900 --> 03:58:14,700
I'm taking off my hat.

6419
03:58:15,534 --> 03:58:18,968
Also, I want to ask
when did you want to stop for today?

6420
03:58:19,234 --> 03:58:21,301
Because like, we haven't. Gone
far off the reservation.

6421
03:58:21,301 --> 03:58:23,702
OK? Yeah. One more mission. We shoot.

6422
03:58:25,502 --> 03:58:27,186
I'm naked now.

6423
03:58:27,219 --> 03:58:28,286
Are you?

6424
03:58:28,736 --> 03:58:29,519
Yeah.

6425
03:58:30,986 --> 03:58:32,136
You're naked.

6426
03:58:32,303 --> 03:58:34,003
Your heart is gone.

6427
03:58:34,170 --> 03:58:36,454
Oh, no. Oh, no.

6428
03:58:36,454 --> 03:58:38,404
She goes. Yes, youSussy.

6429
03:58:38,404 --> 03:58:42,638
You know, don't you dare, motherfucker.

6430
03:58:43,588 --> 03:58:45,388
Don't you dare.

6431
03:58:46,172 --> 03:58:47,338
Hey, it's me.

6432
03:58:47,338 --> 03:58:50,139
I got some information about lead. Oh, OK.

6433
03:58:50,222 --> 03:58:51,489
You know where he is?

6434
03:58:51,489 --> 03:58:52,506
I just met him.

6435
03:58:52,506 --> 03:58:56,673
Give me his location, you son of a bitch.

6436
03:58:56,673 --> 03:58:58,540
Just tell me where he is.

6437
03:58:58,540 --> 03:59:00,907
You got it.

6438
03:59:00,907 --> 03:59:02,040
Good job.

6439
03:59:02,257 --> 03:59:03,691
Talk to you later.

6440
03:59:03,874 --> 03:59:07,358
Wow. Wildfire, we got sold out.

6441
03:59:07,591 --> 03:59:10,258
What the fuck

6442
03:59:10,258 --> 03:59:11,458
Harvey?

6443
03:59:11,675 --> 03:59:12,759
What's up?

6444
03:59:12,759 --> 03:59:14,109
I found it.

6445
03:59:14,109 --> 03:59:14,942
Good.

6446
03:59:15,126 --> 03:59:17,193
Make sure we put up best guy on this.

6447
03:59:17,193 --> 03:59:19,059
I want him dead. You got it.

6448
03:59:19,059 --> 03:59:21,476
What the fuck, man?

6449
03:59:21,476 --> 03:59:23,010
I thought she was cool.

6450
03:59:23,010 --> 03:59:26,194
Yeah, same rich man.

6451
03:59:26,194 --> 03:59:26,944
Fuck rich.

6452
03:59:26,944 --> 03:59:28,194
People.

6453
03:59:30,928 --> 03:59:34,745
It's I came out so in genuinely.

6454
03:59:34,828 --> 03:59:36,179
I don't know, it was just like.

6455
03:59:36,179 --> 03:59:38,379
Yeah, fuck rich people. Yeah.

6456
03:59:40,446 --> 03:59:42,963
Well, now my wife is pissed. Oh.

6457
03:59:45,713 --> 03:59:46,863
Oh, fuck, no.

6458
03:59:46,863 --> 03:59:49,314
Oh, my God. She's hatching.

6459
03:59:49,830 --> 03:59:51,514
Hatching?

6460
03:59:52,347 --> 03:59:53,314
Oh, no.

6461
03:59:54,181 --> 03:59:56,465
This is happening right now.

6462
03:59:56,881 --> 03:59:58,465
Oh. Oh, no.

6463
03:59:58,465 --> 03:59:59,365
Oh, no.

6464
04:00:02,349 --> 04:00:04,799
My name is Caramel Moretti.

6465
04:00:04,799 --> 04:00:07,750
I'm pregnant,
and I think I'm going into labour.

6466
04:00:07,983 --> 04:00:10,900
Oh, no,

6467
04:00:12,567 --> 04:00:14,917
please send an ambulance.

6468
04:00:16,868 --> 04:00:20,635
OK, does she even say hatching?

6469
04:00:22,352 --> 04:00:23,685
I think yeah.

6470
04:00:23,769 --> 04:00:26,469
You said she's hatching

6471
04:00:27,869 --> 04:00:29,069
oh, that's.

6472
04:00:30,186 --> 04:00:31,886
Look, man, focus on the game, OK?

6473
04:00:31,886 --> 04:00:34,153
Focus on driving. It. Can you stop it?

6474
04:00:34,203 --> 04:00:36,037
You're the one that's driving it.

6475
04:00:36,037 --> 04:00:38,187
You're the one that's driving,
mother fucker.

6476
04:00:38,187 --> 04:00:40,838
Excuse me. I sure hope so.

6477
04:00:40,838 --> 04:00:43,055
I mean, I'm focussing on driving.

6478
04:00:43,055 --> 04:00:44,371
You focus on sitting there.

6479
04:00:44,371 --> 04:00:46,022
Oh, we're going to see a movie together.

6480
04:00:46,022 --> 04:00:48,455
Oh, you're going to have a little date
night.

6481
04:00:48,972 --> 04:00:52,256
We're going to see a miniature beer.

6482
04:00:52,706 --> 04:00:54,189
And Douglas Johnson,

6483
04:00:55,406 --> 04:00:56,556
it's just a name that's the.

6484
04:00:56,556 --> 04:00:58,207
Names of the actors.

6485
04:00:58,207 --> 04:01:00,357
They're going to see East River.

6486
04:01:00,357 --> 04:01:01,757
Yep. Oh, fuck.

6487
04:01:01,757 --> 04:01:03,024
OK, let's go.

6488
04:01:03,024 --> 04:01:06,024
Oh, sure. To get us that play, like.

6489
04:01:06,024 --> 04:01:08,191
We solve our guns too. No, no guns.

6490
04:01:08,425 --> 04:01:10,858
I think they're shoved in our ass
right now.

6491
04:01:11,375 --> 04:01:13,709
Can we just go around the city? Oh, man.

6492
04:01:14,226 --> 04:01:15,776
Hold on. Wait. I think we can.

6493
04:01:15,776 --> 04:01:17,226
Got to make that phone call first.

6494
04:01:17,226 --> 04:01:19,260
Oh, man.

6495
04:01:19,593 --> 04:01:20,677
Phone call.

6496
04:01:20,677 --> 04:01:21,293
That's the name of.

6497
04:01:21,293 --> 04:01:23,544
The movie theatre. The phone booth
last year.

6498
04:01:24,210 --> 04:01:26,577
Oh, yeah, right.

6499
04:01:27,127 --> 04:01:29,411
And you got to make a phone call.

6500
04:01:29,411 --> 04:01:31,111
I'll snoop for the call.

6501
04:01:31,111 --> 04:01:33,145
I don't have any change. What?

6502
04:01:33,445 --> 04:01:34,445
How we get money.

6503
04:01:34,445 --> 04:01:36,179
On the other side of the square.

6504
04:01:36,179 --> 04:01:38,162
Maybe I could get some change there. Here.

6505
04:01:38,162 --> 04:01:38,729
Oh, my God.

6506
04:01:38,729 --> 04:01:40,296
I can't believe do.

6507
04:01:40,296 --> 04:01:41,879
Well, how about we ask these people?

6508
04:01:41,879 --> 04:01:43,530
Hey, you have any money?

6509
04:01:43,530 --> 04:01:45,863
I'm just gonna sit down
what about that guy?

6510
04:01:46,197 --> 04:01:48,397
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Oh, fuck. Me.

6511
04:01:48,514 --> 04:01:50,281
Tell her she's making a big mistake
breaking.

6512
04:01:50,281 --> 04:01:52,614
I didn't want to get involved in this.
I just want a free change.

6513
04:01:52,864 --> 04:01:54,215
Oh, could I get some money?

6514
04:01:54,215 --> 04:01:56,948
Jesus, spin off. She make him.

6515
04:01:57,032 --> 04:01:58,832
This is not my business.

6516
04:01:58,832 --> 04:02:00,399
If you make him, you know, I'll.

6517
04:02:00,399 --> 04:02:03,032
Five bucks making a big mistake.

6518
04:02:03,032 --> 04:02:04,116
Yes, of course.

6519
04:02:04,116 --> 04:02:05,316
She is.

6520
04:02:05,316 --> 04:02:08,233
No, you slept with her best friend. Oh.

6521
04:02:08,767 --> 04:02:09,833
What are you doing over that?

6522
04:02:09,833 --> 04:02:11,784
Yes, but it was a long time ago.

6523
04:02:11,784 --> 04:02:12,834
It was terrible.

6524
04:02:12,834 --> 04:02:15,217
I mean, she was frigid sorry.

6525
04:02:15,334 --> 04:02:17,851
You're on your own. Oh, thanks a lot.

6526
04:02:18,901 --> 04:02:21,935
They're having a couples dispute
or something.

6527
04:02:21,935 --> 04:02:23,635
I saw you flirting with her.

6528
04:02:23,635 --> 04:02:24,419
Oh, God.

6529
04:02:24,419 --> 04:02:25,536
I'll sort this out, OK?

6530
04:02:25,536 --> 04:02:28,203
Yeah,
you got this fucking right. We're talking.

6531
04:02:28,203 --> 04:02:30,636
He was arrested.

6532
04:02:32,187 --> 04:02:34,170
My I do mind.

6533
04:02:34,170 --> 04:02:37,104
Just like a girlfriend here did
when you were flirting with another girl.

6534
04:02:38,004 --> 04:02:39,788
At least someone understands me.

6535
04:02:39,788 --> 04:02:41,638
Damn, damn.

6536
04:02:41,638 --> 04:02:43,838
Sorry. I'm a that's how you handle it.

6537
04:02:44,972 --> 04:02:46,689
Fine. All right. I'm sorry.

6538
04:02:46,689 --> 04:02:48,189
Say it like you mean it.

6539
04:02:48,189 --> 04:02:49,889
I'm really, really sorry.

6540
04:02:49,889 --> 04:02:53,006
I don't believe you. Damn

6541
04:02:53,006 --> 04:02:56,307
and you don't sound very sorry, dude.

6542
04:02:56,307 --> 04:02:57,123
Whoa.

6543
04:02:57,157 --> 04:02:59,190
What the fuck, dude? I'm a magician. Man.

6544
04:02:59,874 --> 04:03:01,974
That's what you mean. Slender man.

6545
04:03:02,874 --> 04:03:05,074
Hey, do you have any change? Hello?

6546
04:03:05,074 --> 04:03:06,308
Can I help you with something?

6547
04:03:06,308 --> 04:03:07,775
Oh, he looks like something.

6548
04:03:07,775 --> 04:03:10,375
I need to buy some porn.
Make a phone call.

6549
04:03:10,375 --> 04:03:11,009
Sorry.

6550
04:03:11,009 --> 04:03:13,709
But you have to buy something first. SC.

6551
04:03:14,709 --> 04:03:16,176
Any recommendations?

6552
04:03:16,176 --> 04:03:17,976
All right, what do you recommend?

6553
04:03:17,976 --> 04:03:20,843
We're literally on the pay phone right
here.

6554
04:03:21,093 --> 04:03:23,877
Oh, magazines.

6555
04:03:24,127 --> 04:03:25,311
I'll pass.

6556
04:03:25,311 --> 04:03:27,211
Literally right here.

6557
04:03:27,211 --> 04:03:27,694
Give me some.

6558
04:03:27,694 --> 04:03:31,261
So I'm sure.

6559
04:03:32,728 --> 04:03:34,829
This guy kind of OK.

6560
04:03:35,045 --> 04:03:37,196
You're welcome, Jim. All right.

6561
04:03:37,862 --> 04:03:39,546
How does he not see that?

6562
04:03:39,546 --> 04:03:42,063
Literally right there. Damn it.

6563
04:03:42,063 --> 04:03:44,497
This is these guys my see?

6564
04:03:44,497 --> 04:03:45,663
All right, all right.

6565
04:03:45,663 --> 04:03:46,297
Can we just like.

6566
04:03:46,297 --> 04:03:49,614
I. Think we finally
we just bought off those newspapers

6567
04:03:51,481 --> 04:03:54,415

till you see them up there.

6568
04:03:54,415 --> 04:03:56,665
Oh, yeah. He's watching, right?

6569
04:03:56,965 --> 04:03:58,082
You make the phone call.

6570
04:03:58,082 --> 04:03:59,215
Oh, look at this guy.

6571
04:03:59,215 --> 04:04:01,116
Hey, man, what you look at up?

6572
04:04:01,116 --> 04:04:02,666
Spell me.

6573
04:04:02,666 --> 04:04:04,766
Go on. Pussy.

6574
04:04:05,650 --> 04:04:06,966
I'm coming up

6575
04:04:08,617 --> 04:04:11,434
what if I can ruin this catfish moment.

6576
04:04:11,434 --> 04:04:12,384
Can you?

6577
04:04:12,451 --> 04:04:15,568
Oh, no, I don't think so. Hey.

6578
04:04:16,201 --> 04:04:17,885
Yeah, I don't appear it's.

6579
04:04:17,885 --> 04:04:20,252
Not like in. Free rendered cut scene.

6580
04:04:20,252 --> 04:04:22,469
Look, I need to fly somewhere.

6581
04:04:22,885 --> 04:04:25,169
This bullshit. Tomorrow.

6582
04:04:25,169 --> 04:04:26,586
For your end of the cut scene that. Work.

6583
04:04:28,503 --> 04:04:29,436
OK, great.

6584
04:04:29,436 --> 04:04:30,836
We're going to Mexico, right?

6585
04:04:30,836 --> 04:04:32,287
Is that what they said?

6586
04:04:32,737 --> 04:04:33,937
No idea.

6587
04:04:35,004 --> 04:04:37,471
What what

6588
04:04:37,554 --> 04:04:40,588
what, when,

6589
04:04:40,588 --> 04:04:42,055
what's when, where.

6590
04:04:42,055 --> 04:04:43,022
Where? She.

6591
04:04:43,105 --> 04:04:43,622
Oh, my God.

6592
04:04:43,622 --> 04:04:46,705
Really? OK,

6593
04:04:46,705 --> 04:04:47,705
you're gone.

6594
04:04:47,705 --> 04:04:49,056
I think so.

6595
04:04:49,056 --> 04:04:51,056
When I go, I got to be swarmed.

6596
04:04:54,923 --> 04:04:55,207
Yeah,

6597
04:04:56,273 --> 04:04:58,824
I think they're talking about life
and labour play.

6598
04:04:59,157 --> 04:04:59,824
Yeah.

6599
04:05:00,157 --> 04:05:01,107
Yeah, I did.

6600
04:05:01,257 --> 04:05:02,974
But I need to go all right.

6601
04:05:02,974 --> 04:05:03,841
What are you talking about?

6602
04:05:03,841 --> 04:05:04,441
You OK?

6603
04:05:04,441 --> 04:05:07,108
I'm fine,
but I need to be somewhere else right now.

6604
04:05:08,558 --> 04:05:10,109
Hey, you can't just walk away.

6605
04:05:10,109 --> 04:05:13,559
I'm not walking away, but
something happened and I need to be there.

6606
04:05:13,742 --> 04:05:14,576
All right.

6607
04:05:15,509 --> 04:05:16,410
Vincent,

6608
04:05:18,293 --> 04:05:19,777
we come too far to back down.

6609
04:05:19,777 --> 04:05:21,777
No, you need to talk to me.

6610
04:05:22,177 --> 04:05:24,361
Tell me what's going on in your head.

6611
04:05:24,361 --> 04:05:25,827
Uh, wife.

6612
04:05:25,827 --> 04:05:27,994
Preggers. Preggers. Pregnant.

6613
04:05:29,195 --> 04:05:29,728
Greg.

6614
04:05:30,878 --> 04:05:32,612
Greg. Norman?

6615
04:05:32,995 --> 04:05:34,079
What was that?

6616
04:05:34,229 --> 04:05:35,979
Oh. Oh, no.

6617
04:05:35,979 --> 04:05:37,996
Oh, shit. Who is this dude?

6618
04:05:38,496 --> 04:05:42,146
It's his best friend, but he said
he's going to hire his best to kill us.

6619
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:42,880
Oh, God.

6620
04:05:42,880 --> 04:05:45,897
Oh, no. Oh, my God. It's a hit, man.

6621
04:05:45,897 --> 04:05:47,914
He has a silencer. And everything.

6622
04:05:47,914 --> 04:05:51,148
OK, fine.

6623
04:05:52,198 --> 04:05:53,731
It's my wife.

6624
04:05:53,731 --> 04:05:57,032
She's hot. Oh.

6625
04:05:58,749 --> 04:05:59,916
That's your best.

6626
04:05:59,916 --> 04:06:02,199
That's your best list.

6627
04:06:02,966 --> 04:06:05,783
Oh, my God. This is. Dude, this
game's easy.

6628
04:06:05,816 --> 04:06:08,100
I think we were standing still.

6629
04:06:08,100 --> 04:06:09,984
He missed his shot.

6630
04:06:09,984 --> 04:06:10,834
Come on.

6631
04:06:10,834 --> 04:06:12,867
Yeah, and he's shooting nothing.

6632
04:06:14,851 --> 04:06:15,935
OK, I'm running around.

6633
04:06:15,935 --> 04:06:17,485
He's still looking at us. Oh, shit.

6634
04:06:17,485 --> 04:06:19,652
What is this perspective? Quick.

6635
04:06:19,652 --> 04:06:21,419
I'm on the top right now.

6636
04:06:21,419 --> 04:06:23,169
It says a lot, doesn't it?

6637
04:06:23,852 --> 04:06:25,653
Just help me put our point.

6638
04:06:25,653 --> 04:06:27,336
Point,
play Cover the door. Cover the door.

6639
04:06:28,386 --> 04:06:30,003
I'm holding it.

6640
04:06:30,003 --> 04:06:31,503
OK. OK.

6641
04:06:31,503 --> 04:06:33,654
This should buy some diamonds
like this one.

6642
04:06:33,937 --> 04:06:35,404
I actually got lost.

6643
04:06:35,404 --> 04:06:36,954
I was up there.

6644
04:06:36,954 --> 04:06:39,188
Yeah. Oh, shit.

6645
04:06:39,188 --> 04:06:41,255
They didn't close like lockers
and shit. OK.

6646
04:06:41,255 --> 04:06:41,821
Push.

6647
04:06:41,821 --> 04:06:45,122
You get up there and I'll push across.

6648
04:06:45,122 --> 04:06:46,105
Oh, yeah. We'll get out.

6649
04:06:46,105 --> 04:06:47,589
Get up. Go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

6650
04:06:47,589 --> 04:06:48,356
I'll pull. A boom.

6651
04:06:48,356 --> 04:06:50,589
Move you over. Move you over. Ow, ow, ow.

6652
04:06:51,690 --> 04:06:52,956
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

6653
04:06:52,956 --> 04:06:55,223
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

6654
04:06:55,223 --> 04:06:56,307
Ahead.

6655
04:06:56,974 --> 04:06:58,974
OK, I'll give you a quick,
quick, quick, quick.

6656
04:06:58,974 --> 04:07:01,624
Get up, get up, get out. I'm on my way.
I'm on my way, baby.

6657
04:07:01,624 --> 04:07:02,308
I'm on my way.

6658
04:07:02,308 --> 04:07:04,108
I'm on my way.

6659
04:07:05,858 --> 04:07:06,875
Oh, my God.

6660
04:07:07,292 --> 04:07:08,158
Not panicking.

6661
04:07:08,158 --> 04:07:10,375
We're fine.
These are going to get through.

6662
04:07:10,375 --> 04:07:11,709
He is going to get first.

6663
04:07:11,709 --> 04:07:13,626
No, look at him. He's taking forever.

6664
04:07:13,626 --> 04:07:15,009
Oh, my God. He got through

6665
04:07:16,626 --> 04:07:18,593
up. Oh, my God, he got through.

6666
04:07:18,593 --> 04:07:19,293
Holy shit.

6667
04:07:19,293 --> 04:07:20,077
My God, we've entered.

6668
04:07:20,077 --> 04:07:22,327
We've entered
softly, softly, softly, softly, softly.

6669
04:07:24,577 --> 04:07:25,411
He's still here.

6670
04:07:25,411 --> 04:07:27,395
My God. Shit.

6671
04:07:27,395 --> 04:07:29,278
What happened to our guns?

6672
04:07:29,278 --> 04:07:29,878
It's fine.

6673
04:07:29,878 --> 04:07:32,345
Silence gives it last penetration.

6674
04:07:32,912 --> 04:07:33,895
OK, hold on.

6675
04:07:33,895 --> 04:07:36,212
Hey, hold it, hold it. Nice.

6676
04:07:36,212 --> 04:07:37,646
Nice. Oh, I.

6677
04:07:37,646 --> 04:07:39,280
Got move with me.

6678
04:07:41,880 --> 04:07:44,097
Huh? Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

6679
04:07:44,130 --> 04:07:44,964
Dude.

6680
04:07:45,180 --> 04:07:47,947
How many bullets is this going to have?

6681
04:07:47,947 --> 04:07:50,431
He's really so bad.

6682
04:07:50,431 --> 04:07:51,998
He's wasting so many.

6683
04:07:51,998 --> 04:07:52,765
Out of control.

6684
04:07:52,765 --> 04:07:54,065
The next one me here.

6685
04:07:54,065 --> 04:07:55,498
Get behind you.

6686
04:07:56,549 --> 04:07:58,199
Me? Oh, you got mine.

6687
04:07:58,199 --> 04:07:59,132
Oh, Isaiah behind.

6688
04:07:59,132 --> 04:08:01,616
Oh, I'm on the bottom now. OK, ok.

6689
04:08:01,616 --> 04:08:04,266
This is so weird. OK,

6690
04:08:06,033 --> 04:08:07,383
stop it.

6691
04:08:07,383 --> 04:08:08,467
Move along. Move it.

6692
04:08:08,467 --> 04:08:10,234
Yes, I am. I am, i am.

6693
04:08:10,234 --> 04:08:12,417
I'm moving. I'm moving
right now. Your head's covering it.

6694
04:08:14,668 --> 04:08:15,368
Might have.

6695
04:08:15,368 --> 04:08:18,685
Yeah, your head's covering it. Oh, shit.

6696
04:08:18,685 --> 04:08:20,185
You're on the top.

6697
04:08:20,552 --> 04:08:21,452
Oh, I am on the top.

6698
04:08:21,452 --> 04:08:24,636
Oh, I'm on the top of my body
soaking about.

6699
04:08:24,786 --> 04:08:27,336
I thought I was on the bottom.
I wasn't at the bottom.

6700
04:08:27,336 --> 04:08:29,337
Jumped out of them.

6701
04:08:29,337 --> 04:08:31,470
Help me. What are you doing down there?

6702
04:08:31,470 --> 04:08:32,870
Help! Help!

6703
04:08:32,870 --> 04:08:34,987
Oh, oh, crap.

6704
04:08:35,887 --> 04:08:38,688
How the hell does the worst help
ever. Huh?

6705
04:08:39,355 --> 04:08:40,505
Oh, my God.

6706
04:08:42,005 --> 04:08:42,538
Yeah.

6707
04:08:42,555 --> 04:08:44,905
So you just grabbed his gun?

6708
04:08:44,905 --> 04:08:45,572
Yeah.

6709
04:08:46,206 --> 04:08:48,689
Oh, you're so. Oh,

6710
04:08:51,273 --> 04:08:52,440
yeah, yeah, I'm tough.

6711
04:08:52,440 --> 04:08:52,923
Oh, my God.

6712
04:08:52,923 --> 04:08:55,440
My fingers push. Shit.

6713
04:08:56,124 --> 04:08:58,524
Yes. Send your best bitch.

6714
04:08:58,524 --> 04:09:00,758
Send your best.

6715
04:09:02,908 --> 04:09:05,108
That was way too easy.

6716
04:09:05,108 --> 04:09:06,158
I like his other jacket.

6717
04:09:06,158 --> 04:09:08,009
I want to take the jacket.

6718
04:09:08,759 --> 04:09:09,692
You got to listen.

6719
04:09:09,692 --> 04:09:10,409
Yeah.

6720
04:09:12,476 --> 04:09:13,293
Trips close.

6721
04:09:13,293 --> 04:09:15,310
Take it. Take as close.

6722
04:09:15,310 --> 04:09:16,776
Look, I'll take his underwear.

6723
04:09:16,776 --> 04:09:20,227
I don't know what's going on with you,
but we need to finish what we started

6724
04:09:21,127 --> 04:09:23,727
Harvey's going to keep sending
guys like this.

6725
04:09:23,727 --> 04:09:24,928
Yeah, true.

6726
04:09:24,928 --> 04:09:26,678
I know, but. Wifey, you.

6727
04:09:26,678 --> 04:09:28,862
Yeah. If you went to your wife,
though, he'd send someone to.

6728
04:09:28,862 --> 04:09:30,478
Oh, my wife is pomegranate.

6729
04:09:31,829 --> 04:09:33,245
It's my wife.

6730
04:09:33,245 --> 04:09:34,862
She's in the what?

6731
04:09:35,079 --> 04:09:36,513
What's the problem?

6732
04:09:36,579 --> 04:09:37,496
Pomegranate?

6733
04:09:37,496 --> 04:09:40,146
Yeah. Oh, my God. Is great. News.
What does that. Mean?

6734
04:09:40,180 --> 04:09:41,697
That's, man, you know?

6735
04:09:41,697 --> 04:09:42,663
I mean, she's.

6736
04:09:42,663 --> 04:09:44,280
She's great.

6737
04:09:44,314 --> 04:09:45,214
Pregnant.

6738
04:09:46,497 --> 04:09:47,848
When when does.

6739
04:09:47,848 --> 04:09:50,131
The pomegranate become a thing?

6740
04:09:50,131 --> 04:09:51,815
To fragment

6741
04:09:52,798 --> 04:09:55,115
her Papa, papa, papa, papa.

6742
04:09:55,415 --> 04:09:57,499
It's just a. Bigger cheese pomegranate.

6743
04:09:57,599 --> 04:09:59,149
Really cool.

6744
04:10:00,749 --> 04:10:01,533
Look,

6745
04:10:01,566 --> 04:10:04,200
complicated or not,
you got to go see a kid.

6746
04:10:04,950 --> 04:10:06,533
Whatever's going on between you two.

6747
04:10:06,533 --> 04:10:07,584
Oh, man.

6748
04:10:07,584 --> 04:10:09,817
Your kid. Oh, he gets it.

6749
04:10:09,817 --> 04:10:10,951
You're right.

6750
04:10:11,317 --> 04:10:12,818
Of course I am.

6751
04:10:12,868 --> 04:10:14,435
You know I am.

6752
04:10:15,068 --> 04:10:16,802
Yeah, I am.

6753
04:10:16,802 --> 04:10:19,052
You got to that playing, didn't you?

6754
04:10:19,052 --> 04:10:21,336
I did. Here's what we're going to do.

6755
04:10:21,719 --> 04:10:25,869
We're going to go to the hospital,
see your kid, then we go get that plane.

6756
04:10:26,253 --> 04:10:26,920
Mm hmm.

6757
04:10:27,336 --> 04:10:29,853
It was me. Mm hmm. Yeah.

6758
04:10:31,704 --> 04:10:32,737
Oh, with you,

6759
04:10:33,337 --> 04:10:35,404
Vincent. I need to trust you on this one.

6760
04:10:35,854 --> 04:10:37,354
You can trust me.

6761
04:10:37,988 --> 04:10:38,371
All right.

6762
04:10:38,371 --> 04:10:40,688
How do we jerk each other off in the cell?

6763
04:10:40,688 --> 04:10:44,039
I don't think
he gets more trusting than not.

6764
04:10:44,105 --> 04:10:47,756
Yeah, you literally ate my ass

6765
04:10:48,906 --> 04:10:49,890
I only trust.

6766
04:10:49,890 --> 04:10:52,107
I only let people who I trust eat my ass.

6767
04:10:53,823 --> 04:10:57,241
Oh, you know,

6768
04:10:57,241 --> 04:10:59,308
I could tell it was your first kid.

6769
04:10:59,308 --> 04:11:00,158
You could?

6770
04:11:00,991 --> 04:11:02,408
Yeah. What the fuck?

6771
04:11:02,408 --> 04:11:04,292
You having flashbacks again?

6772
04:11:04,292 --> 04:11:07,175
The way you were holding
your baby and shit.

6773
04:11:07,175 --> 04:11:10,459
I mean, sorry about the shit part, I.

6774
04:11:10,792 --> 04:11:13,409
I don't mean in a bad way, you know, but.

6775
04:11:14,260 --> 04:11:16,443
Yeah, anyway, it's a great.

6776
04:11:16,443 --> 04:11:18,594
OK, you a kid. Cool. OK.

6777
04:11:18,594 --> 04:11:20,194
Yeah, that was awkward. I was.

6778
04:11:20,194 --> 04:11:22,077
Very hell.

6779
04:11:22,077 --> 04:11:24,328
You know what?

6780
04:11:24,328 --> 04:11:25,878
That was a weird life.

6781
04:11:30,595 --> 04:11:31,445
Look,

6782
04:11:34,146 --> 04:11:36,029
Carol is the love of my life.

6783
04:11:36,029 --> 04:11:36,779
Oh, man.

6784
04:11:36,779 --> 04:11:40,080
Always wanted to have a child

6785
04:11:40,830 --> 04:11:42,097
we tried for years.

6786
04:11:42,097 --> 04:11:44,697
All we did every time we failed

6787
04:11:45,697 --> 04:11:47,814
was like a part of his died.

6788
04:11:47,814 --> 04:11:51,448
Oh, did he let someone else
fuck his wife finally happened?

6789
04:11:51,448 --> 04:11:54,099
Oh, that day when we found out,

6790
04:11:55,032 --> 04:11:58,416
I never been so happy.

6791
04:12:00,266 --> 04:12:02,550
Why did you default to like somebody else?

6792
04:12:02,550 --> 04:12:03,416
What's wrong?

6793
04:12:03,416 --> 04:12:06,967
Because maybe his sperm doesn't
match of hers, you know?

6794
04:12:06,967 --> 04:12:08,784
So they need someone else's sperm.

6795
04:12:08,784 --> 04:12:11,484
What if it was your sperm, huh?

6796
04:12:11,484 --> 04:12:13,351
What if it's your child?

6797
04:12:13,685 --> 04:12:15,785
Like we're family now.

6798
04:12:16,885 --> 04:12:18,569
That would make us related.

6799
04:12:18,569 --> 04:12:19,202
Yeah.

6800
04:12:19,202 --> 04:12:20,286
Oh, well,

6801
04:12:23,336 --> 04:12:26,070
ok. I think this is a good place
to stop them.

6802
04:12:26,253 --> 04:12:28,353
Yeah, it is. It pulled it off here, and.

6803
04:12:28,353 --> 04:12:30,487
Yeah,
because the game is still like, what?

6804
04:12:30,570 --> 04:12:30,937
How what?

6805
04:12:30,937 --> 04:12:32,887
How far are we into the game? Like,
halfway.

6806
04:12:32,887 --> 04:12:34,171
I think it's halfway.

6807
04:12:34,171 --> 04:12:36,871
I think I got told
it was like a nine hour game.

6808
04:12:36,871 --> 04:12:39,121
Yeah. So this is nothing.
So we're, like, halfway.

6809
04:12:39,121 --> 04:12:41,338
So I think we could finish it next time.

6810
04:12:41,338 --> 04:12:42,505
This thing.

6811
04:12:42,505 --> 04:12:44,606
Yeah. All right, let's end the here chat.

6812
04:12:44,756 --> 04:12:45,839
Okeydokey, it.

6813
04:12:45,839 --> 04:12:48,756
Should not go. Oh, that was really fun.

6814
04:12:49,056 --> 04:12:49,806
I enjoyed that.

6815
04:12:49,806 --> 04:12:51,990
I enjoy that. It's on like this is.

6816
04:12:52,107 --> 04:12:54,307
I've never played a game like this.

6817
04:12:54,307 --> 04:12:57,691
Besides, it takes two, and I can see why
I won this one game of the year.

6818
04:12:57,691 --> 04:13:00,058
It's something I don't know or.

6819
04:13:00,058 --> 04:13:01,258
Like I wanted a word.

6820
04:13:01,258 --> 04:13:03,575
Something like
that is still really fucking awesome.

6821
04:13:04,858 --> 04:13:05,642
Oh, my God.

6822
04:13:05,642 --> 04:13:07,559
Like, don't kiss.

6823
04:13:07,559 --> 04:13:11,826
Me. Oh, oh, oh. Ok.

6824
04:13:12,059 --> 04:13:14,310
But thank you for collabing today with me.

6825
04:13:14,843 --> 04:13:16,143
Because you were here.

6826
04:13:16,143 --> 04:13:16,943
It was really fun.

6827
04:13:16,943 --> 04:13:19,644
There's a lot of good moments in this,
I think.

6828
04:13:19,644 --> 04:13:23,794
OK, all right, so just do the next one
sometime in the future.

6829
04:13:24,895 --> 04:13:25,978
Yeah, I could do.

6830
04:13:25,978 --> 04:13:28,745
I we have talked about,
I don't know, either next year,

6831
04:13:28,795 --> 04:13:31,179

your interrupting. You're interrupting.

6832
04:13:31,195 --> 04:13:31,746
Sorry. Sorry.

6833
04:13:31,746 --> 04:13:33,629
I thought you're needy and fucking bitch.

6834
04:13:33,629 --> 04:13:34,413
Anyways.

6835
04:13:35,079 --> 04:13:35,879
We're getting we can do.

6836
04:13:35,879 --> 04:13:36,846
It either.

6837
04:13:38,947 --> 04:13:40,913
We could either.

6838
04:13:44,697 --> 04:13:45,547
Redone.

6839
04:13:46,131 --> 04:13:47,398
Are you done? Huh?

6840
04:13:47,398 --> 04:13:48,665
Are you done?

6841
04:13:49,148 --> 04:13:51,148
What? What?

6842
04:13:51,148 --> 04:13:56,732
So we can probably do this either
next week

6843
04:13:56,732 --> 04:14:01,616
or in the within the next couple of weeks
or whatever.

6844
04:14:01,616 --> 04:14:03,817
You whatever you wanted to
we can talk about.

6845
04:14:03,817 --> 04:14:06,034
Yeah. I don't know

6846
04:14:07,617 --> 04:14:09,234
why my
schedule my schedule is pretty free.

6847
04:14:09,234 --> 04:14:10,568
So then talk about that.

6848
04:14:10,568 --> 04:14:12,935
I do want to finish this game, though.
It's really fucking amazing.

6849
04:14:12,935 --> 04:14:14,251
Yeah, of. Course.

6850
04:14:14,435 --> 04:14:18,119
Yay. All right, I'll
just talk to my chat for a bit then, OK?

6851
04:14:18,152 --> 04:14:18,535
All right.

6852
04:14:18,535 --> 04:14:19,502
I will log off here.

6853
04:14:19,502 --> 04:14:21,786
Did take care and have a good day, dude.

6854
04:14:21,786 --> 04:14:22,619
All right?

04:14:22,886 --> 04:14:24,703
Yeah, you too. Bye.

6856
04:14:24,703 --> 04:14:25,736
Bye. Bye.

6857
04:14:25,736 --> 04:14:27,253
Thank you, Dude.

6858
04:14:30,120 --> 04:14:31,921
Fucking kiss me.

6859
04:14:33,237 --> 04:14:33,638
Hold on.

6860
04:14:33,638 --> 04:14:34,438
Give me a second.

6861
04:14:34,438 --> 04:14:35,754
I'm going to exit.

6862
04:14:38,038 --> 04:14:39,222

Let's go back to the bedroom.

6866
04:14:47,906 --> 04:14:50,106
Gimme a second, y'all.

6867
04:14:50,106 --> 04:14:52,223
I just got to figure out
how to get back to the bedroom.

6868
04:14:56,007 --> 04:14:58,174
Here we go. All right,

6869
04:15:00,458 --> 04:15:01,358
Hello?

6870
04:15:01,475 --> 04:15:02,425
Hello?

6871
04:15:03,242 --> 04:15:03,875
Where am I?

6872
04:15:03,875 --> 04:15:06,309
Oh,there am I, very cool. Okay.

6873
04:15:07,559 --> 04:15:10,509
All right, I'll turn on some music,
and then we can talk for a little bit

6874
04:15:10,509 --> 04:15:12,360
before we end things off. Okay.

6875
04:15:12,360 --> 04:15:14,393
Thank you guys so much for coming
by today, though.

6876
04:15:14,393 --> 04:15:17,610
It means a lot that everyone here
really enjoyed the game.

6877
04:15:17,610 --> 04:15:19,194
I had such a fun time with this.

6878
04:15:19,194 --> 04:15:21,578
This is fucking amazing, dude.

6879
04:15:22,294 --> 04:15:23,494
Like, honestly,

6880
04:15:24,878 --> 04:15:25,495
I didn't think it was

6881
04:15:25,495 --> 04:15:29,179
going to stand up to anything compared
to it takes two, but shit dude, I'm.

6882

I'm really enjoying myself so far, and,

6883
04:15:32,246 --> 04:15:34,496
Like, it keeps changing, right?

6884
04:15:34,529 --> 04:15:37,530
You never really

because the like,
everything is like, really?

6886
04:15:39,997 --> 04:15:43,231
What's it you just it flips between, like,
what you got to do from one part to

6887
04:15:43,231 --> 04:15:45,648
the next. And the minigame games
are also really pottery still.

6888
04:15:45,964 --> 04:15:48,098

6889

What do I get for
winning the arm wrestling?

Holy shit.

6891
04:15:51,548 --> 04:15:54,149
Oh, gosh, I lower down the music.

I'm going to read through all the donations and stuff

6895
04:15:59,166 --> 04:16:01,350
that happened during the stream
because I didn't get to read through

6896
04:16:01,350 --> 04:16:03,833
all of them
while all the fucking chaos is happening.
