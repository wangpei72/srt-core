1
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,021
All right.

2
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,588
Hello. Hello.

3
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:44,605
Hi, guys.

4
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,155
Good morning.

5
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:49,672
And this is a little stuffy today,
so you might hear that a bit.

6
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,589
Sorry about that.

7
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:54,022
Good morning, everybody. How's it going?

8
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:54,739
What's up?

9
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,740
I just had today Hmm.

10
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,357
Because I'm ready to cook, and,
you know, so's my.

11
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:04,907
So is my little friend down here.

12
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,057
Hold on. You want to say hi?

13
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,357
I say hi.

14
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,758
Hmm. I'll think he knows why
I put him under your desk this time.

15
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:17,391
What is he doing under the desk?

16
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,825
You don't have to know.

17
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,325
You don't have to know.

18
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,792
Got a substitute?

19
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,559
I only did that because he.

20
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,159
Told me before we got word.

21
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,459
Forgot your dream started out.

22
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,259
Last time we collabs,
he did the same shit to me.

23
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,443
And he shoved me under the fucking desk.

24
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:36,960
Like,
what was that? Wow. So I just like it.

25
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
My way
of getting some sweet little revenge.

26
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,477
That's all that

27
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:43,477
Yeah, he just.

28
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:45,444
He just spoke and said, look it

29
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:48,028
up, up, up, up,
up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

30
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:50,961
I'll take even those. Look at him.

31
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,512
Look at his looking so silly. OK,

32
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:57,029
I'm talking to his shot right
now, too. OK.

33
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,829
But yeah.

34
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,263
So today we're just going to be playing
some some overcooked.

35
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:07,730
This is the first time
I've ever played overcooked.

36
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,947
I've never played this game before.

37
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,747
It's going to be.

38
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,230
It's going to be something.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,697
I heard. It's stressful.

40
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:19,681
I heard this game is pretty stressful,
and it can be kind of hard

41
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,881
I mean, I don't think that's the only
thing that's going to be hard today.

42
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,465
But don't

43
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,798
until until the chef, OK?

44
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:30,199
I mean, I'm the chef.
What am I talking about?

45
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,732
I'm the chef. Yeah,

46
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:35,582
Mm hmm.

47
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,666
Also, I'm going to
be taking a lot of sips of my tea because.

48
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:43,250
Oh, my goodness,
my throat is really feeling that today.

49
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:44,717
So all.

50
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,300
Yeah, I don't know what to expect.

51
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,051
Vox wants a collab,
something I was sud sure.

52
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,901
We said overcooked.

53
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:57,618
And I mean, I don't know
what's going to happen, but so I'm excited

54
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:03,502
to just fuck around in the kitchen
and have those comically times.

55
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:04,619
It's fucking raw.

56
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:07,852
Just pop out of nowhere, so. OK, hold on.

57
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,819
I think I can switch over the screen.

58
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,069
Also,
good morning, everybody. Good morning.

59
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,320
Good evening. I'm

60
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,953
sorry about that.

61
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,037
Oh, I only fixed that.

62
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,754
I forget what I make myself. Beer.
You're just like our.

63
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,204
We're just everything,
so. OK, I'm good to go now.

64
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,371
I'm giggles CFR boxes. Ready? OK,

65
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:31,188
yeah.

66
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,705
I hope you're having a good evening,
everybody, and thank you for coming by.

67
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:35,805
All right.

68
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:38,055
Why you do that?

69
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,055
Hello? Hello.

70
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:41,155
Why did you just increase in size?

71
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:43,239
Very small. Oh, the fuck out of it.

72
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,189
You were kaiju.

73
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,589
No, no. OK, so there's a thing.

74
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:47,489
There's a thing.

75
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,790
I press a button,
and it makes my face super big.

76
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,490
It's like I'm coming to give you a big
kiss on the face, you know?

77
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,273
And then.

78
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,757
And then I had to return it,
but then I realised it was.

79
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,307
Oh, shit. Advocacy that I hope
he didn't like.

80
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,241
I did I was just talking with my child.

81
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,241
I was like, ooh,
I wonder when he's going to one.

82
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,008
You wonder
when we're going to get to chat.

83
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,541
I wonder when we're going
to get to stop the game.

84
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,608
And then you went like, Hello? Hello.

85
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,708
And then straight towards the screen
I was scared.

86
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,875
I was fucking terrified. Oh, I'm so sorry.

87
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,609
Now it's all right,
everyone say hi. Shoot.

88
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,026
I shot the way. That's me.

89
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:20,309
I fuck you.

90
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:21,076
So cute.

91
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:22,493
I look.

92
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,726
I woke up, like, an hour ago,
all right. OK?

93
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,477
And I can't really blame you for that.

94
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,227
We on. We're on different time zones.

95
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,160
He's he's.

96
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,027
He's coping with a lot of a lot of shit.

97
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,294
I woke. I woke up a while ago.

98
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,077
I did. And then.

99
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,078
Yeah, you got early sleep, didn't you?

100
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:37,261
Like, I got very.

101
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,161
Oh, yeah.

102
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,311
You are big, man. Look.

103
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,645
Yeah, look at me. Healthy man, right?

104
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:43,612
Very healthy, man.

105
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,195
So you you've touched this game before.

106
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,245
I haven't such a question. About one yeah.

107
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:52,529
You're going to be like my
my mentor or like, was it going to be the

108
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,346
the Gordon Fiori?

109
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,180
I'll be my baby.

110
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,880
Baby Xbox Ramsay, you'll be my apprentice.

111
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,797
And together, we'll make it through
this chef themed adventure.

112
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,531
OK, so you have to invite me, so.

113
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:07,881
OK, ok.

114
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,581
Yeah, grab me, grab me from.

115
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:11,214
They go.

116
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,515
You invite me where I did.

117
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:18,115
Although there's storm.

118
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:20,715
Oh, you did all right.

119
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,315
Oh, so you did.

120
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,532
So you did.

121
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,683
OK. Am I in you are.

122
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:28,966
Pug. Oh, you are.

123
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,650
Hey, let's go.

124
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,716
Look, he's the puppy. The world.

125
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,583
The dog is pretty damn cute.

126
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,317
And he is really cute.

127
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,217
I like the smile on the turtle.

128
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,167
They didn't have a monkey,
so I went for the turtle.

129
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,201
Or they don't have a monkey boy.

130
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:43,067
They don't have a monkey.

131
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,151
No, they don't have a monkey, huh?

132
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,251
All right.

133
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,318
OK, now what else do they have?

134
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,485
They have, like, weird looking
people till.

135
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,068
They've got some human beings
and they've got bunch of animals.

136
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,535
Oh, I like that dog.

137
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,602
Yeah, there's a kitten oh.

138
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,886
Is a grandma is a right mouse.

139
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,236
Panda pirate lady pirate man.

140
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:03,203
What?

141
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,720
They all look at that shark fuck is that.

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,470
Oh, that's a shark.

143
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,937
How do you know these animals so well?

144
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:11,020
Sharks are not difficult.
To. Recognise me.

145
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:12,887
That's a shark.
I thought that was like a lizard.

146
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,021
Yeah, I was like, oh, my God, that's.

147
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,254
That's a chameleon.

148
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,504
Look at the fucking fin on the back.
You dig?

149
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:20,454
Oh, there's a oh, yeah, there is a fin.

150
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:23,305
OK, well, you know,
improving your point. Good, good on you.

151
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:25,672
You know, your animals. On the back. Did
all right?

152
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:27,405
I struggle in the garden.

153
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:28,972
I'm attached to the turtle now.

154
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,505
All right, story.

155
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,156
All right, chef.

156
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:32,689
Game.

157
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:33,322
Where are we going?

158
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,939
We're playing the story.

159
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:39,056
Yes. OK, this play the story mapped

160
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:43,973

161
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:44,840
Oh, shit.

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,440
Yes, yes, yes.

163
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,340
So pay attention.

164
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,741
So essentially the way it works
is we go to work together to make dishes.

165
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:50,541
Mm hmm. Hmm, hmm.

166
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,241
The following is based on actual events
only the names, places and vegetables

167
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,258
have been changed.

168
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:56,191
Thanks enough

169
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:01,075
just off the tee time.

170
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,142
Oh, what the fuck?

171
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:04,125
Who's this guy.

172
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,475
You. Are?

173
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,259
Is that a cookie long?

174
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,476
OK, that's a fucking onion, you dickhead.

175
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,410
I thought, OK,
I was going to say coconut next.

176
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,810
How is. How the fuck am I supposed to know
it's an onion?

177
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,910
That's how you.

178
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,510
Caramelised the cookie.

179
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,577
It's an onion. You take an. Onion.

180
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:22,260
Look at it. Covered look. The fabled.

181
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,427
No, I'm not America on

182
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,628
blue.

183
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,728
Oh, oh, I can do that. OK.

184
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,195
He literally leapt at the chance
and everything was super.

185
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:37,495
He literally the. One.

186
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:38,245
This is one.

187
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,296
Line. OK, I need a one line.

188
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,496
Is. What. I'm.

189
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:48,980
What do you mean it's dangerous?

190
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,363
Don't be silly.

191
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:54,830
This book holds the secret to everlasting
culinary greatness in a large bowl.

192
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,697
Dissolve the sugar.

193
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,981
In warm water, then stir in. Yeast.

194
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,331
You will go down to.

195
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,498
Proof until yeast resembles a rich.

196
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:02,848
Creamy foam.

197
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,248
Foam. Apple

198
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,515
what a wild time from that one.

199
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,815
Who makes it sold an.

200
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,749
Oil and mixes the flour

201
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:13,966
in the dough covered with a damp cloth.

202
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,999
Well,
this is just the recipe for making bread

203
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,299
and allowed to.

204
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,716
Right?

205
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,833
You see that right back there?

206
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,950
Oh, it's night of the living bread.

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,200
That's the.

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,317
Dough fucking cheese.

209
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:32,184
Rise, rise up, huh?

210
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:35,284
Yeah.

211
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:36,418
No, no, no.

212
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:37,701
This wasn't supposed to happen.

213
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,618
It can't be. It's

214
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,285
beyond bread.

215
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,235
We're resorting to food puns already.

216
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:49,319
I mean,

217
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:51,886
look, this is a cooking.

218
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:52,853
It is a cooking game.

219
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,186
You know, it is like it is a game.
Where is it going to be?

220
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:59,537
You could use my best chefs or could be
the ones that happened to be here.

221
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:00,587
See if you could.

222
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,987
Find them all. Well, they seem hungry.

223
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,621
So we got to feed them.

224
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,671
I got to feed them.

225
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,488
I got to fuck me. Wait.

226
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,388
All right.

227
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,838
Grab you. Want to shop inside,
grab the lettuce.

228
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:13,305
I can't throw the lettuce.

229
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:15,105
As a space to grab.

230
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:16,705
And now I've got to put it over here

231
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:19,155
so I can't access your side of the thing,
right?

232
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,239
I can't.

233
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,406
I can't move the lettuce yeah.

234
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:23,639
Because you're on the other side.

235
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,339
Oh, I'm the dog.

236
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,790
I'm the
dog. You've got something here for you.

237
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,156
I'll grab the lettuce
and I'll take it to the chopping board.

238
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,940
I'll space.

239
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,557
OK. I'll take you to the chopping
board and space again,

240
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,891
and then chop OK.

241
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,441
You have to figure out what the button is
and to maybe chop.

242
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,475
E, e e e.

243
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,775
OK, what now?

244
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,625
E e chop.

245
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,059
What's answer?

246
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,676
I'm pressing answer.

247
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,476
Yes. I shut the lettuce I'm chopping.

248
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,559
I don't like about this.

249
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,626
I played on my switch
the last time I played this.

250
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:03,926
I can. Oh, all, all.

251
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:04,826
No, that's not it.

252
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,043
Hold on. Wait,

253
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:09,777
I'm pressing every button on my keyboard.

254
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:10,727
By the way.

255
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:16,578
Um, are very professional,
as you can tell.

256
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:19,495
I can't chop lettuce.

257
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:20,895
How much? I like gestures.

258
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,928
Yeah, ease the gestures I can.

259
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:25,995
Trying to figure it out.

260
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:28,679
G g no, no.

261
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,529
P answer control no mouse control.

262
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,696
It's control.

263
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:38,146
All right, now you've got to get the chop.
Let's put it on my side.

264
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,863
Mm hmm. Hmm, hmm. How?

265
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:40,947
Oh, just. Just down.

266
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:41,663
Yep. Yeah, yeah. Good.

267
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,930
You put that down,
then we've got to play a

268
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,197
and I put that on the thing,
and we've got it.

269
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:46,947
All right. Oh, that's it.

270
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:49,131
Why did I just want to kind of
let us talk.

271
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:51,931
OK, now you got to do with the chop.

272
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,448
I'm going to chop. Oh, my God.
You're giving me two ingredients at once.

273
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:54,865
What is this?

274
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,948
Yeah, and remember, uh, remember.

275
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:01,399
Remember that you are also times
like in the real game.

276
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,282
Everything that happens were timed. Yeah.

277
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:07,283
All you have to do is you have to
do, like, a lot of dishes

278
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,349
in a short amount
of time. You motherfucker.

279
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,400
You motherfucker.

280
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,933
Hold on a week.

281
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,967
You can give me a snack
to give me something.

282
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:17,033
Something with some cucumber.

283
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,834
Do, do, do. Take my cucumber.

284
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,834
Where's your cucumber? Try him. Try.

285
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:24,017
Take, take,
take my massive green fucking cucumber.

286
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:24,768
Oh, damn.

287
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:27,718
It's chocolate. You take the time.

288
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,901
I'll fucking

289
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:33,502
lie in the brain.

290
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:35,269
You take a wave.

291
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,619
I didn't know
you. Could take out of the bag.

292
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:39,869
I. I can't take out of the bean.

293
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,019
I got to get you another fucking cucumber.

294
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,753
You know, I didn't know that was a bean.

295
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,553
Told me a fucking cucumber.

296
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,070
Hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up over at the shop.

297
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,937
The, the the the the tomato.

298
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,737
That's the tomato.

299
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:55,137
That's the that's the middle.

300
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:56,454
That's the

301
00:14:58,788 --> 00:14:59,988
way you started.

302
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,105
That is I just get the lettuce.

303
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:04,905
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,438
I literally just gave you a letter.

305
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,305
Said you and Callie, who were just.

306
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:09,655
Like it was out.

307
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:10,739
Oh, my God.

308
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,172
I oh, I can't.

309
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:12,839
I forgot.

310
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,706
I forgot how to chop only shit no more.

311
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,289
I wonder why there's so many more orders
now. What's happening?

312
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:20,640
Because they're fucking hungry,
you dickhead.

313
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,190
Why is it still coming?

314
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,290
Holy fucking home, James.

315
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,840
Chill. Chill for one second.

316
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:30,107
The UN bread aside.

317
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:32,191
Why are you not helping?

318
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:33,408
Where's your chicken?

319
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,558
She's actually God damn on this side.

320
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:37,425
Kill shit you do.

321
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:40,492
Why am I doing all the chopping
for all my God chopping.

322
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,892
Bones are on your side, you fucking idiot.

323
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,776
Well, now.

324
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,159
OK, ok, ok. You got.

00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,826
Let us go now. Roger.

326
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:51,809
I need another lettuce.

327
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:52,726
I need another lettuce.

328
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,926
I need another fucking lettuce.

329
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,410
Always. There's four orders.
Why is there. For orders for.

330
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:58,493
Oh, my God.

331
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,510
We were seconds.

332
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,410
You do were down there, right?

333
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,061
There's 30 seconds.

334
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,011
Why are there 30 seconds?

335
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,111
I didn't know we were being times already.

336
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:06,894
Oh, my God.

337
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:07,794
Oh, shit.

338
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:08,328
I can help.

339
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:08,828
I can help.

340
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:09,444
Holy shit.

341
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:10,578
We got teamwork.

342
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:11,661
Oh, my God.

343
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:13,945
Tomato, we can get laid up.

344
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:15,778
Give me the tomato.

345
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,479
Yeah. Where you young about the tomato.

346
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,679
Oh my God.

347
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,196
How you got now
you put down the tomato on the same table.

348
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,596
Put on the table.

349
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:26,613
That is now.

350
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,263
You there's no way.

351
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:27,796
There's no way.

352
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:28,913
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

353
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:31,047
Oh, my God. Box of logs, monster.

354
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,080
There's so many orders. There's
so many orders.

355
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,297
Holy shit. We did it.

356
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,147
Yeah, I mean, we did eventually.

357
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,114
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,531
Oh, so ravenous.

359
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,898
Oh, oh, oh.

360
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:49,248
Oh. Don't be a hero.

361
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:51,465
Coming right back to the castle retreat.

362
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:54,466
My heart rate's high.

363
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,849
My dude, dude, my.

364
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,399
My blood pressure spikes during that.

365
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,066
I'm sorry.

366
00:16:59,066 --> 00:16:59,966
I am sorry.

367
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,500
I was really.
I was really enjoying being you.

368
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,983
That was the fucking tutorial.

369
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,150
Excuse me. What the fuck?

370
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,300
No, it may be my best traps, but you have.

371
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Much to. Learn
if you're to conquer that appetite.

372
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:13,501
Man. Kevin, to keep those fiends
from entering the castle.

373
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,701
But now, if the unbridled
spread from the castle grounds,

374
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,468
I fear for the onion kingdom,
we must act quickly.

375
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,118
Fuck me by oh.

376
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:26,085
As my boy. Kerrigan.

377
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,136
Why, of course. The Royal Stagecoach.

378
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,019
She's just been. Upgraded. The royal sage.

379
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:30,769
Oh, it seems.

380
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:33,669
What's a guy that's up to you, Chef?
To save our kingdom? Monaco Coupe.

381
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,286
I guess it was a rough take.
My wheels hit the road.

382
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,820
Learn some new recipes
for the love of onions.

383
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,003
Learn to. Collaborate.

384
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:43,670
We spent three streams learning
how to collaborate.

385
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,587
You can't see shit,
you fucking caramelised.

386
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,971
I love this. This guy
kind of reminds me of Dr.

387
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,921
Hakim. He's got a moustache.
He's got. A moustache.

388
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,288
Oh, we. Can walk.

389
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:52,455
How do I slap you?

390
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:53,038
Oh, my God.

391
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,822
Get the fuck back here. Also,
I know there's a button for Sprint.

392
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:58,222
I'm just trying to figure out what it is,
because in the in the.

393
00:17:58,455 --> 00:17:59,805
It's like a dash.

394
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,605
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Look, it's adorable.

395
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:05,789
I didn't see the.

396
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,039
Dog evil in front of the dog.

397
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,640
The dog is like was.

398
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,306
He can't even talk to you.

399
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:11,957
What are you. Waiting?

400
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,957
Waiting for? Go I'm good.

401
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:15,957
Eat your moustache.

402
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:19,674
My controller actually means be easy
with the controller.

403
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,074
I think control is a weird oops.

404
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:25,374
All was that you? It was me.

405
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:27,208
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my.

406
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,258
Our control is not working.

407
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:31,125
My collaboration.

408
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,809
Collaboration. Oh, my, my, my, my.

409
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,309
I it's been doing that recently. We

410
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,509
someone said that you orgasm.

411
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:40,159
Oh, gosh, help out.

412
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,143
Is that she fucking kidding insults.

413
00:18:42,143 --> 00:18:43,260
OK, yeah.

414
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,043
So I guess control alt space
and then the arrow keys.

415
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,227
Oh, are we driving?

416
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,910
No, you're. Driving.
You and me, we're not.

417
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,227
We're on camper van.

418
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,127
Oh. Yeah?

419
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,077
Yeah. You're the one at the wheel.

420
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:59,878
You ran over a civilian,
you fucking swat over the umbrella.

421
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:01,695
We're doing our job. I got you.

422
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:04,228
See what you did for what I do.

423
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,779
They didn't do anything they're customers.

424
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,229
You know, there are customers at
a point signs. I'm ready to

425
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,446
be ready on the customers.

426
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:13,079
Oh, my God.

427
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,379
This man,
we're going to lose our business.

428
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,480
Well, it's only like.
Well, it's not about business.

429
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,213
It's about defending the kingdom.
Oh, shit. It's our business.

430
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,813
All right. World.

431
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,130
One dash, one fucking mushroom
kingdom. Here we go.

432
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,564
Mushroom kingdom.

433
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,381
OK, get me in there.

434
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,831
Oh, oh.

435
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,964
All right. Sashimi.

436
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,265
So you get the fish, you chop it.

437
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,665
All right,
so you fish, and you need shrimp,

438
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:40,048
and then you chop it,
and then you make sashimi.

439
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,049
OK, that's not too bad.

440
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,449
All Look, we're actually. Together now.

441
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,116
All right?

442
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,533
So now. All right, but but.

443
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,449
Boy, where's where's the.

444
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:51,016
Shrimp?

445
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,950
I I'm trying, but.

446
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,434
OK, but I do have the shrimp.

447
00:19:58,434 --> 00:19:59,850
I said the shrimp are on your side.

448
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,317
OK. You got to put the shrimp on.

449
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,001
Chop them up, huh?

450
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,151
What will happen?

451
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,018
I put the shrimp out, but.

452
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,868
You did it. You did it.
You gave him a meal.

453
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,368
I gave him meal.

454
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,318
Well, no, I gave him a plate.

455
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:17,385
Huh? I said there's some
that is just shrimp.

456
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,669
They just want raw shrimp.

457
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,436
Who wants raw shrimp?

458
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:25,320
Hold up I don't know if I can enjoy it.

459
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,903
Give me a
how do I put it down on the plate?

460
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,753
You remember.

461
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:30,620
You got to hit space.

462
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,970
You got to hit space over the plate.

463
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,087
We had to chop it first, like, God. Yes.

464
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:37,737
Fucking chop the shrimp, you dumb arse.

465
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,971
OK, now.

466
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,271
All right, so we need
we need something to you,

467
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:44,121
because otherwise this is going to work,
like there are so many plates out there.

468
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,405
OK, OK, I'll just I'll just keep
I'll just keep chopping.

469
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:47,872
I'll just keep chopping shrimp.

470
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,555
I think that's all, you know,
I just drop the shrimp.

471
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:52,372
I'll just shop
shrimp shop shrimp, top shrimp.

472
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:55,072
Oh, God.
The keyboard controls are really weird.

473
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,023
Do I pick up the plate? You see that? You.

474
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:00,240
I pick up the plate, and then the shrimp
falls off onto the table.

475
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,806
What is that?

476
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,740
Could you guys tell that, too?

477
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,990
Right?
You guys saw that soon? Fucking tell.

478
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,574
You got these
controls are really going to fuck with me.

479
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:10,924
The game is like, griefing me.

480
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:12,408
Oh, well.

481
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,841
Would you, like,
push me on the other side of the room?

482
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,325
I was crazy.

483
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,708
Oh, what do you mean?

484
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,808
This is a real man's kitchen's.

485
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:23,692
On we're collaborating together.
What are you talking about?

486
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,259
This is a real house kitchen.

487
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,409
I'll collaborate with your mom.

488
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:29,509
You know what?

489
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,676
My mom's dad oh, god.

490
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,243
No, she's not, actually. Boom! Oh.

491
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:35,843
My God.

492
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,027
All right.

493
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:40,594
Imagine what they're cursing at us.

494
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:42,977
Your mom. Oh.

495
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:44,761
Why are they cursing at
us? We're doing it.

496
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,028
This is there's only. So much
you can handle.

497
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,678
Calm down.

498
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:49,428
Do you need help over there?

499
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,828
By the way, it looks like you got a lot
fish on your side.

500
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:52,995
Are you fine?

501
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,045
Yeah.

502
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,178
If you could come over
and help me chop some fish,

503
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:59,295
or I'll chop the fish, and then
you can grab it and you can grab it.

504
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,096
You know what that's get?

505
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:03,296
That's all that's good
on. I could give you plates.

506
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,179
Well, I could give you plates.

507
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:07,380
Oh, my God. Yeah. There you go.

Yeah, that's. That's a finished meal right

00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

510

I can help you out, OK?

511
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,847
You know, is not so bad. This one's not.

512
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:15,797
Elaborate.

513
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,047
Elaborate on. OK.

514
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:22,314
And you just dropped it on the floor.

515
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,981
Wait, can I serve this

516
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,548
yeah. I'll

517
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:27,865
be Larry's sauce.

518
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:29,965
Drop it on the floor, though. Now.

519
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,215
I'm not a shrimp.

520
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:35,332
I'm not a shrimp. Oh, God. Oh, God.

521
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,649
No, no, actually, actually, you got one.

522
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,099
More like you.

523
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,516
One more, one more. Yeah, yeah.

524
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,766
726. Oh, boy.

525
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,317
Not bad. Not bad at all.

526
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:45,767
Look at us.

527
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,650
Look at us three.
So let us look at that dog. God.

528
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,967
All right, all right. Well,
making it. We're making it.

529
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,701
That wasn't so bad.

530
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:55,051
Yeah, it was actually quite easy.

531
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:58,285
It was just chopping shrimp and fish

532
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:01,285
do people eat raw shrimp?

533
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:02,818
I've never seen that.

534
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:04,969
I guess so.

535
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,335
Or maybe they'd already been cooked
and we were just chopping them.

536
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,036
Oh, OK.
You know what? You do have a point there.

537
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:13,153
OK, I want. To fucking desert
level. Did it?

538
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:14,236
It did it, Len. Thinking

539
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,120
that it had it at a

540
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,587
weight. Where are we?

541
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:20,720
New recipe.

542
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,187
Sushi sushi. Sushi.

543
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:24,687
We need to chop fish.

544
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:26,904
And then you boil.

545
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,821
This out of rock.

546
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,688
It looks like a rock of rice.

547
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,038
That's a that's a bowl of rice.

548
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,388
That's a bowl of rice
all. Or boiling the rock.

549
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:35,088
OK, OK, so.

550
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:37,305
So before we begin. Oh, my. God. Is pause.

551
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,655
Pause, pause.

552
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:39,255
OK, yeah, yeah.

553
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:41,905
Pause. OK,
so the shopping bowls are on my side.

554
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:45,856
I will chop while meanwhile
the boiling is on your side.

555
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:49,823
You should grab the the rice
and boil it on your side.

556
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,623
OK, that would be kind of
like splitting the thing up.

557
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:53,940
And then when my stuff is done,
I'll bring it over to you.

558
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:58,340
Actually, you should bring the rice to me
and then I'll get the sushi.

559
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,424
OK, with.

560
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,857
Are are they ok? OK.

561
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,191
I can see that.
These people are getting in my way.

562
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,108
Why are they working in the kitchen?

563
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,408
The thing, the thing about overcooked

564
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,825
is that it fucks with you, and there
will be obstacles in different stages.

565
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,609
Yeah. Bucket out the fucking kitchen.

566
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:17,059
Well, who are you people?

567
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,142
Who are you? Evil.

568
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:20,793
Oh, my God. I'm a chill in that right now.

569
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:21,293
Do that right.

570
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:21,959
Hold this.

571
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,343
We'll at this.

572
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,376
I mean, sushi.

573
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:25,126
Doesn't bad fucking.

574
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:27,910
Syria. It's burning by the fucking rice.

575
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,477
You ready? Did I make tonight
make sushi? Does I just make sushi?

576
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,310
Oh, my God.

577
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,427
No, no. Look at this. Look at that sushi.

578
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:36,661
Look at it. Sushi, go.

579
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:37,528
I think I did it.

580
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,078
OK, where's my other porco?

581
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,328
Hello?

582
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:43,045
Oh, it's right here. Thank you.

583
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:46,128
OK, sir, please
get the fuck out of the kitchen.

584
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:49,729
I'm not still cooking as you have.

585
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:50,846
Please, from your side.

586
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,329
Why is everything everywhere? I can like
I can, like, throw shit.

587
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:54,296
Hold on.

588
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,580
There we go. Off, off, off, off, off.

589
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,063
Off. All the.

590
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,797
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

591
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:03,897
Oh, my God.

592
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,964
Oh, dude, dude, what is happening?
What is happening?

593
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,531
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

594
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:10,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,781
Oh, fucking idiot.

596
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:14,281
God. That's a lot.

597
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:14,848
It's a lot.

598
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,881
OK, what is. It's on.

599
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,082
Oh, you know what? That looks pretty good.
That's good. Rice.

600
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:21,565
Uncle Roger would be proud of

601
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:23,949
I'd put more.

602
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,466
More rice.

603
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,082
OK, I see.

604
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,299
I could just take it off of that.
I'd take it off of the fucking.

605
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,583
So I'm getting used to controls
now. Yeah. Yeah.

606
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,983
Get out of the way.

607
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,050
Oh, my God. It's up. Like.

608
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,050
What do you mean, soccer players?

609
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,151
She's walking
right in front of my fucking job.

610
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,001
To complain.

611
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:43,817
Oh, no. Oh, no.

612
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:44,418
Oh, no.

613
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,434
OK, give it, give it.

614
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:47,251
Give it to me. Give it to me.

615
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:48,685
What happened to the rice?

616
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:51,352
You just took away my rice.
I put it on the fucking plate

617
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,652
because you're being too slow,
you fucking pillock.

618
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,469
I didn't know there was a
there's a point there.

619
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:56,935
Oh, shit. Yes.

620
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:57,769
OK, ok.

621
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,069
Ah, more rice.

622
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,319
More rice. I'm
making I'm making more rice.

623
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,419
Wait, no, that's. That's fish. Harder.

624
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,719
Drop the fish.

625
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:08,070
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow.

626
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:09,953
You're just throwing stuff at me.

627
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:11,904
How did you do that all by yourself?

628
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,587
It's control. Actually, I figured it out.

629
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,437
Yeah, ok. OK, ok. All right.

630
00:26:15,437 --> 00:26:17,571
I got more rice. More rice. Oh.

631
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:19,038
Oh, God.

632
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,204
Wait. No, I had to put this on a plate
now, too.

633
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,971
OK, look at that. More rice. Yes.

634
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:24,138
You got to put the rice on that fucking.

635
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:25,705
Plate, you idiot.

636
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,155
Oh, I picked up the fish.

637
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,505
What's the fish doing on the floor?

638
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,756
What is that
fish doing on the fucking floor?

639
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,972
Where did that come from?

640
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:35,789
Oh, my God.

641
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:37,823
There's so much fish

642
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,556
I don't know where to put the play.

643
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:43,040
Just put the fucking blades down,
you stupid dog.

644
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,190
OK, ok, ok. OK.

645
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,391
Everything I've seen here is you, ok?

646
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:51,624
Dude, I'm plugging right now.

647
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,091
Oh, no, I'm not. No, not.

648
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,941
What, dude? All of my power.

649
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:55,558
Never plugged in.

650
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,391
You all of fucking.

651
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:58,758
My follow some mega improv.

652
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:01,308
You've never plugged in
you all fucking night.

653
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:02,508
Do we fail, dude?

654
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,659
Power way.

655
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,776
How how we were doing is listen, listen.

656
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,743
You just it's not about fulfilling
every order.

657
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:14,310
It's about fulfilling enough orders.

658
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,743
So if the orders run, the orders will keep
coming until you run out of time.

659
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,194
But all you have to do is make sure
that none of them run out of time.

660
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,811
So you people, ok, ok,

661
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:26,678
if an order gets, like, failed,
that's when you start moving points.

662
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:28,611
No, chef.

663
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:31,261
Chef bog

664
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:32,578
all you fuck.

665
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:34,128
OK, that makes more sense now.

666
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:36,062
I thought we had to fulfil
all the fucking orders.

667
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:38,929
So then when the tickets just kept. Coming
and coming and.

668
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,896
Coming and coming and coming and coming,
I started.

669
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,929
I kind of don't stop coming.
You give me some road head

670
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:47,146
road ahead.

671
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,830
Wait, what's road ahead?

672
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:51,597
Oh, he's so sweet. He gets.

673
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:52,497
Is it like road?

674
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,347
Is it like road? Kill

675
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,397
and I definitely a horn.

676
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:00,147
We are going to look that up real quick.

677
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:02,581
You got me curious. Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Look it up.

678
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,714
Yeah, a road, right?

679
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,081
Don't look up for me. Actually,
don't look up.

680
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:06,748
You could look me in the.

681
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:10,198
Road ahead the end of the road
where men and goods must continue on foot.

682
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:12,415
Sir, the animals, heroic brands.

683
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:16,049
What That's not quite what I meant,
but let's listen.

684
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:16,399
We'll just.

685
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,249
We'll just move on. We'll just move on.

686
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,316
And the acts of a man receiving.

687
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,917
Hey, you go.

688
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,384
That's that box that's, you know.

689
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,618
You know, I'm curious.

690
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,884
I know you, Michael. I thought, you know.

691
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,468
I had to think about it for a second.
It's like I bought you.

692
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,135
I just like to come.

693
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,502
Butcher girl as a as like the same.

694
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,102
If I. Am OK, what do I do now?

695
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:48,169
I don't get distracted by my fucking dick.
All right?

696
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,686
I'm bigger, right?
I'll put some rice. Inside

697
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,169
on. Your side.

698
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,819
Put the rice in the saucepans, OK?

699
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,870
All I have are we.
What is this going to start?

700
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,736
I'm going to start chopping the shrimp.
I'm going to start chopping.

701
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm about to start chopping.

702
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,821
Butter, and we're in business now.

703
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,937
Come on. Oh, shit. You're right. Oh,
my God.

704
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,471
I was going how to drop it.

705
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,088
How do I drop it?

706
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:11,688
How do I drop it?

707
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,505
How do I drop it?

708
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:13,288
Oh, my God.

709
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:16,472
Oh. Oh, my.

710
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,022
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

711
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,189
No, no, no.

712
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:20,505
Oh, no. Oh, no.

713
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:21,089
Fuck him.

714
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,656
You're burning fucking rice,
you idiot. OK, how do I.

715
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:24,439
How do I.

716
00:29:24,622 --> 00:29:25,756
What are you doing?

717
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,139
Can we use this?

718
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,256
No, I've got to put it in the fucking bin.

719
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:31,756
Now, as you. Saucepan back, you idiot.

720
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:34,490
Oh, shit.

721
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,690
OK, thank you. Thank you. OK. Ah.

722
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,657
Oh, I have cucumbers on my side.
You know what?

723
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:40,891
I think you might need cucumbers.

724
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:44,358
I'm going to bring it over there till are

725
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,741
I got it with this much.

726
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,658
It's going to be a.

727
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:51,325
Worry, boy.

728
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,859
Come on. Here you go. Here
you go. Here you. Go.

729
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,209
There we go. We got rhythm going now.
All right, all right. That's that's.

730
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,676
OK. OK, now. Repugnant.

731
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,026
I had to wash dishes. Now

732
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:02,759
I'm full of fucking cucumber.

733
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,493
I don't know.
I thought you needed cucumber.

734
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:07,160
You any ingredients off the counters
for the fucking cucumber?

735
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:09,443
What am I supposed to do with the shrimp?

736
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,244
If you're talking about cucumbers,
anything on your mind?

737
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,894
No one's going to be fucking voodoo
to that.

738
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,677
I'm trying to give you like this shit.

739
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,078
You come up
because you filled up the whole thing.

740
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:19,111
With fucking cucumber.

741
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:24,078
It's a wash the dishes to wash the dishes
till it's all going on, bro.

742
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:25,995
Oh, here, go. OK, there.

743
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:28,529
Yeah, there's. There's some there's some.

744
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,829
What about a fella? First fucking order.

745
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,762
Are we really?

746
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:33,946
Are we really? There's no way.
There's no way.

747
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,546
That's impossible.

748
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,430
We're too good at this game.

749
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,296
I need more rice.

750
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,097
Unless I could be an extra
an extra special chef. There you go. Yeah.

751
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,280
I need more
rice and more rice. Any more rice?

752
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,147
Here's another.

753
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,781
Cucumber. There you go.

754
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,914
WA wa wa wa wa wa. Wait, wait.

755
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,148
This is done.

756
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,781
This rice is done. You Dick.
You got to be quicker about it.

757
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:55,698
You got to be quicker about it.
You've got to realise those things.

758
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:56,748
I was testing you.

759
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:57,648
What do you mean

760
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,648
you're testing you? You're really me, huh?

761
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:01,249
Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:03,832
You got to be quicker. When we got.
That's bullshit, right?

763
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,199
You failed.
I don't know what to do of this.

764
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,333
Oh, nice.

765
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,416
OK. Ah,

766
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,166
so we all.

767
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,517
Know, and I'm just letting you know
right now we are not passing this on.

768
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,800
This has been a fucking train wreck.

769
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,667
I have faith.

770
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,967
Why are you giving me cooked rice again?

771
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,867
I didn't do that shit.

772
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,734
Yes, you did.

773
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:25,368
You brought back the cooked rice.

774
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:27,618
We all make too many. Oh, my God, it.

775
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:28,935
Nah, mate.

776
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,885
We got this we still got this. I think

777
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:35,335
yeah, yeah.

778
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:37,969
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

779
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:40,069
Yeah. No, we're fucked. We're fucked.
No, we're not. No, we're not.

780
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:41,369
We're not looking at this.

781
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:44,003
Look at this.
Look at this. You've never seen.

782
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,070
I'm guaranteed like one star maximum.

783
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,737
What happened?

784
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:51,537
What is the old gab?

785
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,554
I'll tell to I'll tell you.

786
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:55,704
I'll tell you what happened
is you can deliver your shit.

787
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,588
I'm very disappointed in you, boy.

788
00:31:58,588 --> 00:31:59,488
Deliver my shit.

789
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,538
You had the thingy on your side,

790
00:32:02,538 --> 00:32:05,538
right? Vox.

791
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,355
Now, you kept it in the rice.

792
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:11,255
You had the conveyor belt on your side.

793
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,289
What, you mean I couldn't deliver my shit?
Yeah, I'm.

794
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,923
I'm responsible. For the orders.
You want to give me the rice.

795
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,573
I was giving you, right?

796
00:32:17,573 --> 00:32:20,340
What, you feel like you got this

797
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:23,690
much rice, all these shakes?

798
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:24,207
Oh, oh.

799
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:25,557
You told back to me.

800
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,540
Boy, you're brand new in this field.

801
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,607
I've been here for decades. Give you.

802
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,057
You can talk back to me, boy.

803
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:33,808
I gave up on you.

804
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:34,408
You want to rice?

805
00:32:34,408 --> 00:32:35,058
You want rice?

806
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,258
OK, you know why you want rice so bad?

807
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,442
I'm going to give you rice. I'm
going to give you some fucking right.

808
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,675
Give me your fucking money.

809
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,742
There you go. OK, there's some rice to go.

810
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,525
Give the rice. Give me more
rice. Even more rice. Fuck you.

811
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:47,609
Just kidding.

812
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:49,876
I love you, you know.

813
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:51,809
Of course he comes crawling back.

814
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,060
What are you doing on my side?

815
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
I already gave you rice.

816
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,960
Fucking give me enough rice.
I need three rice only.

817
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,060
There's only one dish with rice in it

818
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,194
all. There is.

819
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,160
No. There's two.

820
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,977
You're a liar. Well, there are now.

821
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,211
It just popped. Up.

822
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:07,561
No, I think you're a liar.

823
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:11,211
I've been gassed lately, Larry, I.

824
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,395
You want me to go on,
test my fucking patience like that, boy?

825
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:15,228
That's why I'll fucking test
you. I'll fucking SAS here.

826
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:17,329
I get on it again. Oh, you know,
that was me.

827
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,979
My fucking dishes, bitch. Wash my.
Fucking dishes.

828
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:21,529
What is wrong with you?

829
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:23,879
I'm Leach caricature of
you. What the hell?

830
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,929
I'm. I'm

831
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,730
like,

832
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,213
give me.

833
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:31,947
Give me the rice. Give me the right. No.

834
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,113
Oh, that's good.

835
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:37,781
No. Pick up the bup bup.

836
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:39,714
Bup. Bup.

837
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,514
What you. Doing is on my side. For you.

838
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:44,798
You like Popeye?
Why do you take my pop for?

839
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,765
Because you put it on my side.

840
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:47,965
There's no other room.

841
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,282
I need a.

842
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:51,315
Body. 3 hours.

843
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,699
Oh, OK.

844
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:53,849
I forgot about the cucumbers.

845
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:55,882
I forgot.
I fucking forgot about the cucumbers.

846
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:57,916
I'm not fucking cucumbers right now.

847
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,299
OK, here you go.

848
00:33:59,366 --> 00:33:59,999
On. Another help.

849
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:00,766
I'll help

850
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:04,667
you're not fucking helping.

851
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,100
You're in my way.

852
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,167
The right way.

853
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,617
It's burning. It's raining, it's raining.

854
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,934
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

855
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:13,251
Oh, shit.

856
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,534
He didn't see that. It's OK.

857
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,251
What didn't I say? What did I say? You are

858
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,135
going like I say anything.

859
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:21,385
I'm like I said. You got a move.
A fast one. I mean, you know, you're not.

860
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,218
You're not know.

861
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:25,035
If you. Mess up my restaurant,
I will fucking kill.

862
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:28,019
You. Your restaurant?
It's our. Restaurants.

863
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:30,052
What was ours? You're my apprentice.

864
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:32,086
You're our hey.

865
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:33,319
You can serve for once in your life.

866
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,236
Have you ever considered, like,
you know, for once?

867
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:37,036
Maybe.

868
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:39,470
Maybe this is a collaborative effort
where we're sharing.

869
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:41,270
Nothing about collaboration.

870
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,704
This is not a. Sharing. Of our age.

871
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:46,437
This is about
you washing my fucking dishes, boy.

872
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:47,421
Give me.

873
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,387
Just give me more rice.

874
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,688
Any more
rice? Please, please, box, please.

875
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:53,155
Rice, rice, rice. Put it in the pot.

876
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,005
But I'll put it.

877
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,205
I'll put you in the pot.

878
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:01,722
Chef, chef, chef.

879
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:02,606
Chef.

880
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,006
You will be. Boiled. Chef.

881
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:07,039
What the fuck?

882
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,023
You will be boiled.

883
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,390
You know this is not fair.
This is what is.

884
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,773
What is this, chef?

885
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:14,973
A culinary. Inequality did.

886
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:16,857
Hold on. Here you go.

887
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:17,990
The inequality is the customers.

888
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,057
No, getting that fucking food.

889
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:22,708
I'm trying my best right now.

890
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:25,458
Give me a cucumber. Oh, my God.

891
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,058
You think you come back?

892
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,508
I don't know how to put it. Oh,
my God. Here.

893
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,542
You're here. Give me a fucking kick.

894
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,575
Grab the killer. Wow.

895
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,925
I didn't know what I did there. Holy shit.
That was amazing.

896
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:35,575
Oh, you're here. We're cucumber.

897
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:37,759
We're cucumber,
we're cucumber. Here's right through.

898
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:38,276
All right.

899
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:39,476
You're fucking idiots, dude.

900
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:42,376
We did it. Easy clap, easy clap.

901
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:45,026
Look at that. Holy shit.

902
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,810
All thanks to my leadership soon might.

903
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,227
I might.

904
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:52,227
I would like to say my cock
grew, like, three inches after that one.

905
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,777
Oh, good. OK, can I take a look?

906
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,161
Yeah. On here.

907
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,711
I'll bring you over take a look.

908
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,011
Don't look that

909
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:01,195
shit.

910
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:02,928
All right.

911
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,795
That's four inches.

912
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:10,529
Think what you get.

913
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:13,462
Right
was that I had in my head of Patrick's.

914
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,513
Patrick's Day. Through.

915
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,013
Take it or leave it

916
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:18,413
switches.

917
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:20,697
Never switches. Yeah, that's me.

918
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:23,247
OK, so we got a lot of,
like, collectables on the map and shit.

919
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:24,897
OK, hold on.

920
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:27,681
And what the fuck
I said that would be all right.

921
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:29,497
I want to find the switch.

922
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:30,931
I'm right here.

923
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,148
You're not a fucking switch.

924
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,131
You're a bomb. No,

925
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:34,748
people.

926
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:37,098
My my I was.

927
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,782
It told me to be more assertive.

928
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,932
Is something more assertive
about my switch rights, too.

929
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,449
We got a. Balloons. We're buoyant.

930
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,499
What a sick. Foot.

931
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,366
I'm trying to untangle the subject, but

932
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:51,416
switch horses.

933
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,550
Kevin one. What.

934
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,200
Is Kevin one you were trying wrong.

935
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,334
All right, so we're both separated again.

936
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:02,451
No new recipe.

937
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,418
Oh, no. Why is it steamed?

938
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,184
Hams, old family recipe.

939
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,535
Way it's steamed.

940
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:12,585
Chopped me or veg mixed with flour
and then steam together.

941
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:16,285
This is like. Is it like bowels?

942
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,835
Or we can bowels

943
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,819
on what is this?

944
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:21,769
I'm OK.

945
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,719
So what's the fire extinguisher?

946
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,470
All right, so you got some flour.

947
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,403
What do I do with a.

948
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:31,220
For tomorrow's the meat
and then steam it to get.

949
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,420
All right, there's the flour.
Thank you very.

950
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,404
Much. Yeah, I don't want the other flour.

951
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:35,687
What's the flavour?

952
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,637
This one's easy.

953
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:42,121
It's easy for me.

954
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,605
Are you sure it's easy?

955
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,888
I don't know. It's feeling
and feeling a little.

956
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,605
Feel a little sauce.

957
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:48,188
Do this.

958
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,572
I got an order for you.
Got an order for you? What?

959
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,756
Our idea of this oh, no.

960
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:54,056
Here, here, here, here.

961
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:56,123
Here, right here. You'll never know.

962
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:56,989
I thought I have to play.

963
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:59,723
I'll never much anything. Fuck you. God.

964
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,473
I learnt that from Mr..

965
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,240
You will never.

966
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,024
You can't, right?

967
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:07,740
You got to put me in bowls. OK.

968
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,174
Here's the fish.

969
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:11,807
Oh, that's on.

970
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:12,808
Oh, I have to.

971
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:14,791
I have to let the order almost no cooking.

972
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:15,908
It's not cooking.

973
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,025
Fucking don't ask.

974
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:19,275
No, it's not. Wait, it's done.

975
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,308
Can I get a bowl, please?

976
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:23,059
Needs a plate.

977
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:25,075
Hold on, hold on. Bowl. Bowl.
You need a bowl?

978
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,325
I got a bowl for you.

979
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:28,276
I got a bowl for you. Here, here.

980
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:28,909
There's a bowl.

981
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:32,159
All right. Good ah.

982
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,126
Oh, shit. Excuse me.

983
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,210
Yeah, yeah.

984
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,560
I got another order for. Yeah.

985
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,577
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

986
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:43,761
Oh, dude,
I only have two steamers over here.

987
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,561
What do I do with the bowl?

988
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,128
Why do I have so many bowls for.

989
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:49,528
The bowls of mine?

990
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:50,728
Give me the bowls.

991
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,878
I'm trying to give you fish. Hold
on. There, there.

992
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:53,995
There's a fish.

993
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:57,295
There's more fish.
There's a bowl of flour.

994
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,162
You gotta be honest with you.

995
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,262
I can't do anything with the fish
that's about to burn.

996
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:02,629
You got to put the fish straight
in the steamer.

997
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:04,763
Oh, I had to put it
right into the steamer.

998
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:06,746
Yeah, OK. OK.

999
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:07,796
Oh, you're right. You're right.

1000
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:10,196
You're so right. You're so right.
I always. Am.

1001
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,647
Why is this order
sitting on the fucking side?

1002
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:14,597
I don't know.
I was just about to get water.

1003
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:17,030
I have to do the dishes, too. No,
you do the dishes.

1004
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,731
Big boy. Go do the dishes.

1005
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:21,498
Fuck you.

1006
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,181
Oh, my God, dude.

1007
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:23,998
OK, this is done.

1008
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:26,565
This w plates are your powers.

1009
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,448
Are all
this is burning. This burning. Oh, my god.

1010
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:31,949
Everything's burning, everything's
burning, everything's burning.

1011
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:32,715
VOCs.

1012
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,882
What I do, what I do.

1013
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:36,199
Here you go.

1014
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,899
More fish.

1015
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,949
More dishes.

1016
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:43,500
I think.

1017
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,750
I think

1018
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,900
what is this for?

1019
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:49,767
Wait.

1020
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,617
What? What? Wait.

1021
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:53,217
Why did you. Why did you take it?

1022
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:54,567
I think I forgot to put flour in that one.

1023
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:55,401
That's my bad.

1024
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,968
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1025
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:01,035
The meal.

1026
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:03,568
Oh, my God. That's a steam.
The shiatsu one.

1027
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,669
I got to take this off of your station.

1028
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,569
Oh, what is that?

1029
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:10,886
That's nothing. It's.

1030
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,736
I fucked it up. I fucked it up.
Why is that?

1031
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:16,336
Why is I. Well, what the hell?

1032
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:17,603
Listen, listen.

1033
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:17,903
True.

1034
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,920
Culinary mastery is sometimes.

1035
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,520
Sometimes I'll try to fuck it. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1036
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,687
I'm going to get it. I'm gonna get it.

1037
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,971
Oh, no, oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

1038
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:26,871
OK, ok.

1039
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:32,338
Ah, you thought I've done shit,
you pillock.

1040
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:34,638
Are you faffing back there?
What was that noise?

1041
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:37,338
I was rubbing my eyes
because you're boring me, boy.

1042
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:40,455
I'm trying my best. Rubbing my eyes I say.

1043
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,489
Sarah, please.

1044
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:42,222
See? Well.

1045
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,489
Oh, oh, you see, I didn't know you got me.

1046
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:47,006
Sarah got it.
I'll come in the dishes. Sir.

1047
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:49,806
I thought I'm supposed to call you sir.
You're the head shagging.

1048
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:52,340
The big salty surprise. But then.

1049
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:55,040
Sir. Sir?

1050
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,457
Yes, sir.

1051
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:56,540
There's a chef.

1052
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,407
Oh, chef.

1053
00:40:57,407 --> 00:41:00,091
Yes. Yes, Chef.
Thank you. Chef. Yes, Chef. No, Chef.

1054
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:02,207
Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.

1055
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:03,108
Yes, Chef.

1056
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:04,041
Yes, Chef.

1057
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,225
No, hold up. Hold up, Will.

1058
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:08,958
Give me a second. Give me a second.
I have put the orders out.

1059
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,058
I put the orders out.
I'll give you the dishes.

1060
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,975
You need more flour.
Here's the fucking flour. Thank you.

1061
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,726
All right, here we go.

1062
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,009
Here it was sitting on the counter.

1063
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:21,509
You're so blind.

1064
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:23,476
You're so blind. Vaughn.

1065
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,310
There is counter right there.

1066
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,527
Now, there wasn't flour on the counter
that was on the plate.

1067
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,127
You literally put flour
in a bucket of fucking flour.

1068
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:31,760
I can put that in the bowl.
I tried multiple times. It didn't. Work.

1069
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,461
Or you saw here I didn't pull out a plate.

1070
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:36,027
It was really on the plate.

1071
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:36,144
Yeah.

1072
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:37,728
You put flour alone on a plate.

1073
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,978
I can't put that in a fucking bowl.
Really? It's.

1074
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,195
I really

1075
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,212
Oh, my God.

1076
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:47,929
Oh, Papa,
can you just take it off the play, Farid?

1077
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:49,262
I can't.

1078
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:50,679
The game on. Let me

1079
00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:54,396
that seems like
it might be a bit beyond us.

1080
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:56,529
You sure it's beyond us?

1081
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,196
You keep it if you. If you're.

1082
00:41:58,196 --> 00:41:59,596
If you're feeling ballsy about not.

1083
00:41:59,596 --> 00:42:01,763
Actually, no, I'm not feeling that ballsy.

1084
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,563
Yeah.
I didn't think you were. You never asked.

1085
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:14,815
Oh. I was actually upset.

1086
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:17,465
Fuck you. Oh, my dear. God, you are until.

1087
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:17,882
Don't you?

1088
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:19,248
Are you one of us? You are.

1089
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:22,015
You're like you feel you're you're like
a five inch dildo, you know that?

1090
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,749
Not even not even six and still dog
five you one of.

1091
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:25,649
Those single tier.

1092
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:27,832
People going to the fucking restaurant?

1093
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:30,149
Do I look like a double
fucking rainbow to you?

1094
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:32,100
What's that mean?

1095
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,233
What the fuck does that mean?
What are these insults are.

1096
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:35,600
You into a tearing up?

1097
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,267
You're tearing up.

1098
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:38,367
I'm like a double fucking rainbow.

1099
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,334
And you don't don't flatter

1100
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:42,201
yourself.

1101
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:44,751
We we can dash Maggie.

1102
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,284
Sushi on Zoom.

1103
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,435
Oh, my God. I'm fast. Look at me,

1104
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,285
look at me. Go look at me. Go.

1105
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:53,485
Holy shit.

1106
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:56,219
Louis, move out of my way.

1107
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,335
No, you bastard.

1108
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:00,652
I fuck in reviews. There you go.

1109
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:02,153
Why is it look like one of those?

1110
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:05,536
Like, what's it called? Those on rotating.

1111
00:43:06,736 --> 00:43:07,620
Those rotating?

1112
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,887
Yeah, I think. I think that's, like,
literally the entire point.

1113
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,020
And that's like, a really obvious joke
that they're going for.

1114
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,554
OK, well,
you don't have to be so mean about it.

1115
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:17,187
I mean, I mean.

1116
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:17,421
I mean.

1117
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:19,821
I mean, maybe I don't have to be,
but like, you've either.

1118
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,288
Fucked all I can push you.

1119
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:23,488
I can bully you like that.

1120
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:25,488
Then we'll get enough fucking served, boy.

1121
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,288
Well, I just made an entire meal.

1122
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:29,038
What have you been doing?

1123
00:43:29,038 --> 00:43:31,405
I've been making rice for your dumb arse.

1124
00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:33,806
What are you talking about?
What have I done?

1125
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:34,856
Rice. Rice.

1126
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:37,706
This is like the the essence of life.

1127
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,590
For some people and food.

1128
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,323
Oh, my God, you're fucking cereal.
You wouldn't even know.

1129
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:43,907
He wouldn't know. You wouldn't fucking up.

1130
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:48,057
I what are you sleeping about?

1131
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:49,074
You're sleeping on the job.

1132
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:52,641
Is it on the lot?

1133
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:55,641
Cause, boy, you fuck you.

1134
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:57,775
It's about the fuck, you. Know?

1135
00:43:57,775 --> 00:44:00,142
I got it, I got it,
I got it. I'm not even.

1136
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:02,175
Not even worried and not even worried.

1137
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,309
Are you worried about

1138
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,875
everything's everything's fine.

1139
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,325
Fine.

1140
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,609
Everything's OK sometimes.

1141
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:10,876
Sometimes you just have to.

1142
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:12,676
Yet can can vice be raw?

1143
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:14,326
It can be all right.

1144
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:17,993
You'll be raw in a minute
if you shut the fuck up.

1145
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,010
Maybe I don't want to shut the fuck up.

1146
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,210
It's a good thing
I like it. But I don't want me.

1147
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,794
I don't want to shut the fuck up.
What is your.

1148
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,711

00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:27,078
I can't even grab it. OK,
I'm going to be real with you.

1150
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,578
I throw it and I can't reach you.

1151
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:30,611
I can't grab the cucumber. What's.

1152
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:31,795
Oh, no, you can't

1153

00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:34,995
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:35,545

Lots of dirty dishes.

00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:45,446
Move.

1160
00:44:45,446 --> 00:44:47,279
Oh, my God. You're grieving.

1161
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:49,596
Oh, shit, dude,

1162
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,630
I was trying to sell you food.

1163
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,447
You fucking me.

1164
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:56,430
You actually are a devil.

1165
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,931
Oh, my goodness.

1166
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:59,731
What was that?

1167
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,598
Good devil.

1168
00:45:02,598 --> 00:45:04,314
Whoa. I threw fish.

1169
00:45:04,314 --> 00:45:06,448

You go. Ah,

1181
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,450
Keep track of

1182
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,851
how you want more rice or more rice, babe.

1183
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:35,518
Babe.

00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:37,284

00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,768
Babe. More rice, tons. No, I'm good.

1186
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:41,035
I'm good. You're good.

1187
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:43,318
All right,

1188
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:45,669
I got a ton of.
Rice highlights. Oh, my God.

1189
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:47,652
Why are you talking like that? Yes.
I'm so sorry.

1190
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:48,586
I'm so sad.

1191
00:45:48,586 --> 00:45:51,286
You know, you sound so sad. I'm sound.

1192
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:52,736
Why are you sad for.

1193
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:55,253
Sad because. This restaurant's
going to fucking shit.

1194
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:56,336
Dude. We're all.

1195
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,736
No, we're not. Fine. Wait,

1196
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,853
we were not fine, actually.

1197
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:04,737
Hold up, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1198
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:06,354
I can, I can, I can. We can recover.

1199
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:07,971
We can cover to cover.

1200
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:09,471
We can recover.

1201
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:15,855
Why do 2 minutes
like I'm not even joking right now.

1202
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:20,122
2 minutes
passes by like it's fucking nothing.

1203
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:23,156
Yeah, we got our. We got a star

1204
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:26,239
all right, listen,

1205
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:28,589
all right, listen.

1206
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:30,556
OK, ok, I'm listening. I'm listening.

1207
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,240
You and I

1208
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:35,240
are going to have to learn
how to work together, because otherwise,

1209
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,107
this is never going to work.

1210
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:37,907
We need to make a plan.

1211
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:39,557
What's our plan?

1212
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:42,391
Let's get back in there
in this figure out. OK.

1213
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:44,424
Ok, ok, I'm listening. I'm listening.

1214
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:46,891
I thought I. Was doing the rice.

1215
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:47,908
Let me do the rice.

1216
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,242
Let me do the rice chopper. Oh.

1217
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,258
We did. Look, the next thing.

1218
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:54,325
But I think we need more stars
from those stars.

1219
00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:56,609
We need. We need to do bag.

1220
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:58,192
Do we know how to collaborate?

1221
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:00,176
What happened. To us?

1222
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:03,526
I don't know.

1223
00:47:03,526 --> 00:47:05,243
Why you sound so sad.

1224
00:47:05,243 --> 00:47:06,977
Is that why you're so sad?

1225
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:10,043
All I've got to pull is I've got a pulse.

1226
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:11,277
OK? So

1227
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,577
you all right?

1228
00:47:14,577 --> 00:47:15,527
We try. I'm thinking

1229
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:18,528
I will get.

1230
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:22,345
Um, time still ticking,
even if it's players.

1231
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:25,045
Yeah, it is. Oh, my fucking God.
All right, fair enough. I will chop.

1232
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:28,079
I will do nothing, but I will chop
and I will wash dishes.

1233
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:30,829
OK, you do rice and plate up ok? OK. OK.

1234
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:34,196
I will play and do and do rice. As a rule.

1235
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,396
As a rule, never
go the wrong way on the conveyor belt.

1236
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,596
That way, we'll stay out of each other's
way, ok? OK. OK.

1237
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,430
I will also grab you rice
for your fucking thing.

1238
00:47:43,763 --> 00:47:45,897
OK? OK, we're actually going to try.

1239
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,697
Or are you going to try?

1240
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,781
I have been trying.

1241
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,297
We have been trying.
It's just hard. Yeah. Yeah.

1242
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:53,064
This game at this game is really
is really weird.

1243
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:54,414
OK, i think I think I.

1244
00:47:55,465 --> 00:47:59,032
And I'll catch up with
you whenever you fuck up like that. Ok?

1245
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:00,765
All right. Thanks, babe.

1246
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:02,665
That easy you.

1247
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:05,166
People in your mindset ready to be done.

1248
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,699
Well done. You can drop some fucking cute.

1249
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:09,683
We'll grab more rice.

1250
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:10,649
What.

1251
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:12,300
Right comes to shove.

1252
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,733
And now

1253
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:18,717
OK, that Rice's cooking
got more rice from me over there.

1254
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:21,384
Yes, you do. Give me that.
Rice is cucumber.

1255
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,284
What do I do with the cucumber?

1256
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:26,018
I will put it on some of the dishes.

1257
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:28,351
And I'll. Put.

1258
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,335
I don't worry about that. Don't
worry about that. OK, I'll get you light.

1259
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:31,585
I'll get you the fucking.

1260
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:33,735
OK. OK, ok. OK. I got it.

1261
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:36,802
I'll bring in the ingredients during.

1262
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:38,419
I'll get it.

1263
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:40,019
I'll get it. OK. I got it. I got it.
I got it.

1264
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:42,136
I got it. I got it. Easy, easy, easy.

1265
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:50,970
Like sometimes when you release space,
it just sort of like, throws it.

1266
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,454
Oh, my God. We're out of plates.
Are we out of plates?

1267
00:48:53,787 --> 00:48:54,620
Oh, that's my that's my bad.

1268
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:54,920
My bad.

1269
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,421
I'll do the dishes now.

1270
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:01,588
And more.

1271
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:03,438
Rice. You go.

1272
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,655
You come over here.

1273
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:08,605
Come over. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1274
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:11,539
I said only put it back on the stove
on my doing.

1275
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:14,339
Can you actually play it up
like I asked you to? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:16,673
I'm doing it. I'm doing right now.
I'm doing right now. I'm doing right now.

1277
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:17,639
I think I think I did.

1278
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:19,673
My first order of the day

1279
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:24,540
on the rice about burn.

1280
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,307
Holy shit.

1281
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:26,874
This is stressful.

1282
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:28,740
Holy shit.

1283
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,291
Boxes is so stressful.

1284
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,307
We have to split up the jobs that are
all right.

1285
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:34,791
Uh huh. Stop trying to take everything
into your own hands.

1286
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,441
Just do what I tell you
to, ok? OK, ok, ok.

1287
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,475
All rice on
play up the dishes and serve them.

1288
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:42,258
That's all you got to do.

1289
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,125
I will wash, I will chop.

1290
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:46,976
I will do everything else.

1291
00:49:46,976 --> 00:49:49,559
OK? OK, ok.

1292
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:51,959
Got the rice

1293
00:49:54,026 --> 00:49:56,160
and chop.

1294
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,993
Yes, I'm chop this.

1295
00:49:56,993 --> 00:50:01,410
In the meantime, and.

1296
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:04,161
Oh, yeah, I need
I need cucumbers. Any cucumbers.

1297
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,127
Don't worry about. Chopping.

1298
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,211
I've still chop plenty of shit.

1299
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,328
OK. Ok. OK, ok.

1300
00:50:08,928 --> 00:50:11,278
The more you chop, the the more you're
going to lose track of the current thing.

1301
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:13,761
We have eight. Coins.

1302
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,262
We have aids.

1303
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,178
Wait, hold up.

1304
00:50:17,178 --> 00:50:20,179
Hold off. Wait. What happened?

1305
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:22,246
What happened
is you haven't been doing your jobs.

1306
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:24,596
More of them.

1307
00:50:24,596 --> 00:50:27,496
Amber, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1308
00:50:27,596 --> 00:50:29,096
I don't have
I don't have cucumber oh, wait.

1309
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,163
No, I do have cucumber.
I do have cucumber.

1310
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:33,613
I've got so much fish. Boy.

1311
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,697
Yeah, there you go. Good. OK, ok.

1312
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:36,980
OK. I get it. I get it now.

1313
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,647
Hold on. Hold on.

1314
00:50:37,647 --> 00:50:38,964
OK. OK, ok. OK.

1315
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:41,364
We've established. We've established
the jobs.

1316
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:43,464
We know what to do
now. Right now we can't.

1317
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:46,215
OK, I can get right into it again. Right?

1318
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:47,548
Easy, easy.

1319
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:50,748
Right

1320
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:53,399
holy shit.

1321
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:55,616
There's so much this going gets.

1322
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:58,699
Harder to do. This game gets harder

1323
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:00,766
hitting me. Yes.

1324
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:07,667
Ok, i'm ready this time.

1325
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,634
We got it.

1326
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:10,967
Oh, you do.

1327
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,217
I saw I just plate and cook rice.

1328
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:15,418
So you cook rice on. Put rice on.

1329
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:17,118
I will chop.

1330
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:19,285
I will bring the ingredients to you.

1331
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,018
You play top
and I will wash the dishes after that.

1332
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:23,752
All right, so we don't.

1333
00:51:23,752 --> 00:51:24,952
Get three stars.

1334
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:28,019
I'm not male wife material.

1335
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,169
So I don't listen

1336
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:34,186
don't don't listen to the is all what?

1337
00:51:34,286 --> 00:51:35,519
You just threw rice straight.

1338
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,970
OK, so I'm guessing at like a high level
people will just be

1339
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,420
actually, like, positioning themselves
that they can throw.

1340
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,170
Yeah, I saw that sheens.

1341
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,771
Into each other's hands.
That was that would be insane. All right.

1342
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:51,738
You know, I think that's a good strategy.

1343
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:55,438
Just throw the rice over to my side.

1344
00:51:55,438 --> 00:52:02,339
I'll get you the rice door. OK?

1345
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:06,206
No you see that?

1346
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,906
I did you see that?

1347
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,240
Holy shit.

1348
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:19,107
OK, and now I need it.

1349
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:20,307
Yup, yup, yup.

1350
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,191
Yeah, I've got
I've got all the ingredients for you here.

1351
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:23,041
All you got to do is chop them.

1352
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,374
All you got to do is play them up, OK?

1353
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:31,475
OK, I'm going with that.

1354
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:34,125
OK? I need fish and chopped cucumbers.

1355
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:37,426
Oh, oh, yeah.
I've chopped fish right here.

1356
00:52:37,426 --> 00:52:38,692
I've got chopped fish, chop cucumbers.

1357
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:40,076
I got everything you need.

1358
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:44,660
OK, ok, send that out.

1359
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,976
Send this one out.

1360
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:53,877
Pug, ok. OK,

1361
00:52:56,994 --> 00:52:58,561
and I'm going to take this.

1362
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:00,661
There's dirty dishes

1363
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:07,545
and when rice is done,

1364
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:11,596
there's dirty dishes.

1365
00:53:11,596 --> 00:53:13,279
There's dirty dishes.

1366
00:53:15,796 --> 00:53:17,746
Babe, they've.

1367
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:18,896
Come on.

1368
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,047
I'll put it over here, ok?

1369
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,397
And have you actually served anything yet?

1370
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:28,181
Yeah, I have served. I have served.
I got, I got. I did get that.

1371
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,264
Get that one with the cucumber, ok? Yeah.
Almost done.

1372
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,131
You just need some seaweed
i'll get it. I'll get.

1373
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:34,348
I got it. Yeah,
I got the seaweed for the other one.

1374
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:36,148
Yeah, ok.

1375
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:36,381
All right.

1376
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,098
This is what that's working.

1377
00:53:38,098 --> 00:53:40,248
Yeah, that we go out more rice.

1378
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:41,549
I mean, some more plates.

1379
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,315
We need more. Plenty of chopped
fish over there.

1380
00:53:43,315 --> 00:53:44,665
Plenty of chopped fish.

1381
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:46,216
I've got the plate for you.

1382
00:53:49,949 --> 00:53:50,483
Or plates.

1383
00:53:50,483 --> 00:53:52,666
More plates, more plates, more plates,

1384
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,067
Get the fish on it. Get the seaweed on it.

00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,500
I'll put seaweed on it. Mm hmm.

1386
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:02,517

OK, and you put the plate in the

1388
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:08,851
Go get the rice going.

1389
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:10,935
Let me check the fish

1390
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:12,385
rice on that rice on.

1391
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,035
That same rice.

1392
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:14,535
You see.

1393
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:16,485
We see when you got seaweed,
you can put that in. You can see.

1394
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:18,052
We got seaweed. OK.

1395
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:18,919
OK. I got another.

1396
00:54:18,919 --> 00:54:21,286
Rice coming next fresh next, putting it.

1397
00:54:21,286 --> 00:54:23,386
On the another plate.
I need another plate and another plate.

1398
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:24,803
OK, I'll get it on the plate.

1399
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,336
All the plates are dirty.
All the plates are dirty.

1400
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:27,120
I'm going to wash it.

1401
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,370
I thought I'm talking about

1402
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,370
fish, though.

1403
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,837
Listen to the timer. We're doing fine now.

1404
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:35,070
We're doing great.
We're doing great. We're doing great.

1405
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,871
And I have time for another rice.

1406
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:37,487
And to put it in.

1407
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,221
For really

1408
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,455
bad. OK.

1409
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:45,688
I'll fuck.

1410
00:54:45,688 --> 00:54:46,338
I'll do it.

1411
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:47,005
I know you got it.

1412
00:54:47,005 --> 00:54:49,138
You got it.
You got to play that shit right now.

1413
00:54:49,138 --> 00:54:50,122
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:50,839

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,789
OK, I fish fresh
fish, fresh fish, fresh fish.

1416
00:54:54,439 --> 00:54:57,106
Diamonds are my fish. No.

1417
00:54:57,656 --> 00:55:00,706
Oh. Oh, my God. I think we did it, though.

1418
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:01,940
I think we did it all.

1419
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,207
We get. Our lives.

1420
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:03,690
My boy.

1421
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,457
Oh, my god. Oh, yeah.

1422
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:07,607
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1423
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:08,940
Well done.

1424
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,857
Well, fucking John was good.

1425
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:12,257
Oh, yeah.

1426
00:55:12,257 --> 00:55:14,758
Oh, right.

1427
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:15,291
That actually felt.

1428
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,858
Really good to finally. Get it.

1429
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:17,158
That's it.

1430
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:17,875
I think the key.

1431
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,692
The key is looking for the specific
recipes that are on the left, you know?

1432
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:24,075
Oh, ok.

1433
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:28,859
Oh, God. Down

1434
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:30,809
all right,

1435
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:33,109
so we got all hands on.

1436
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:35,176
Oh, well done.
Three stars. I'm proud of us.

1437
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:38,360
That's next.

1438
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,527
Way. Where the fuck are we going now?

1439
00:55:40,527 --> 00:55:42,927
Is that an air balloon? I believe we are.

1440
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:45,061
We're on. OK, this is really going
have some weird physics.

1441
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:47,394
Huh? Physics?

1442
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:47,694
Yeah.

1443
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:51,145
This is this is really going to be
a moving kitchen.

1444
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:53,295
New recipe, possible pasta,

1445
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:56,128
add chopped tomato meat and mushroom
or fish and prawns.

1446
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,729
So basically, we pay attention
to the recipe on the top left.

1447
00:55:58,979 --> 00:56:01,346
And I like before I will do the chopping.

1448
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,746
You cook faster and plates up
and I will do garnishes.

1449
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:04,613
OK? OK.

1450
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:06,896
Oh, actually,
I don't think we have a choice,

1451
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,830
so that is going to move up and down.

1452
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:12,380
All right, so give me my ingredients, OK?

1453
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:14,780
Actually,
now I can get them like you have.

1454
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,697
Can I just grab it?

1455
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:18,781
I'm cooking pasta I'm cooking pasta.

1456
00:56:19,031 --> 00:56:19,764
It's not going.

1457
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:25,515
And I move.

1458
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:26,565
We have salts.

1459
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:27,831
As long as on this.

1460
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:30,798
This is this. Oh, no, no.

1461
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:32,715

There you go.

It's got some cooked tomato
all on. Hold on, hold on.

1466
00:56:39,616 --> 00:56:42,500
Take these off of the burner. OK? OK,

I played on my past. I played with lots.

1471
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:49,884
More pork.

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,317

01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:35,689
I'll go.

1574
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:39,506
I keep talking like that
and then you'll know.

1575
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:40,906
It's all right. Gorgeous.

1576
01:00:40,906 --> 01:00:41,806
Don't worry about it.

1577
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:45,090
Maybe I'll. Maybe I'll give you another.

1578
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,157
Oh, my. He's going to caramelise me.

1579
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:47,874
Yeah.

1580
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,157
All right, let's get back to.

1581
01:00:50,157 --> 01:00:50,974
Back to basics. Salad.

1582
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:54,858
All right, I'm back to so,
so so I will chop you playing, ok? OK.

1583
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:56,941
Actually, yes.

1584
01:00:56,941 --> 01:00:58,975
OK. But

1585
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:01,575
what is the why is there a fire?

1586
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,558
What the hell?

1587
01:01:03,558 --> 01:01:04,225
Right.

1588
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:07,159
OK, so I guess that's the hazard
for this one.

1589
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:08,476
I so you all right?

1590
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:11,876
So I will do chopping
you can be on, you can plates up.

1591
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,976
But also, if you could

1592
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:15,560
fire extinguisher where possible.

1593
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,960
There's no fire extinguishers.

1594
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,677
Oh, so we just have to avoid something.

1595
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,110
I think we just had to avoid it.

1596
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:21,860
What the fuck.

1597
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,977
Does.

1598
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:26,361
Yeah.

1599
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,494
We just got to stay away from the fire.

1600
01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:29,394
What the hell?

1601
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,795
This is such a new. Lettuce and tomato.

1602
01:01:31,795 --> 01:01:32,328
Mm hmm.

1603
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:35,362
Let me tomatoes on millions of meals
on the plate already.

1604
01:01:35,395 --> 01:01:37,312
Say I was on the plane already.

1605
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:40,045
You know, let us know what it say.

1606
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:42,629
Let's see who cooks in these conditions.

1607
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,279
We do bad. What? We're built fucking.

1608
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:48,080
Different kind of restaurant.

1609
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,480
OK, I'm going to wash the plates. Oh,
my God.

1610
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,080
Tomato, tomatoes. Ready?

1611
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,147
Is it tomato? That's ready.

1612
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,364
Wasn't wet.

1613
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:58,614
It's not ready. But all right.

1614
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,531
Alia, it's ready to be shot.

1615
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:01,614
I would say.

1616
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:04,331
Yes. Or all right. It's that.

1617
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:07,165
There's that that there's just not just.

1618
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:09,315
The lettuce on the floor.

1619
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:09,982
Obviously.

1620
01:02:10,048 --> 01:02:11,065
You have that still good.

1621
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:11,899
Still good.

1622
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:15,899
OK, all right.

1623
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,149
Let me just play that up. Send it out.

1624
01:02:18,149 --> 01:02:20,249
Move them.

1625
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:23,666
OK, I'm
going to chop up the cucumber perfect.

1626
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,283
Perfect. Play that up. Play that up.
Yeah, yeah.

1627
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,467
Easy move up.

1628
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:27,867
Fuck!

1629
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:31,017
Oh, my God. Dude,
the fire is such a clock.

1630
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:32,901
Wait a second.

1631
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:35,451
Send it. Send all. Your hash.

1632
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,918
La la

1633
01:02:37,918 --> 01:02:38,818
only. God, there's another.

1634
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:41,368
There's a oh, my goodness.
I'm going to grab it.

1635
01:02:41,368 --> 01:02:43,518
I'm going to grab the the lettuce.

1636
01:02:44,002 --> 01:02:45,468
Grab the lettuce. Oh, wait.

1637
01:02:45,468 --> 01:02:46,169
We need more plates.

1638
01:02:46,169 --> 01:02:48,769
Fuck me. Oh,
please, please, please, please.

1639
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:49,586
Whoa.

1640
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:53,386
Hop oh.

1641
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:55,669
All right. We landed with my line.

1642
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:56,686
We've landed.

1643
01:02:57,586 --> 01:02:58,486
That's crazy.

1644
01:02:58,486 --> 01:02:59,720
All working. Sushi away.

1645
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,937
This conveyor belts right with four.

1646
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:04,404
Oh, my God. All right.

1647
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:06,121
Oh, my. God. Let's.

1648
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:09,137
It's cucumber fucking.

1649
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:13,438
But some of that shit,
some of that whole ennui.

1650
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:15,771
I had to get the rice going out
to get the rice going right now.

1651
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,438
Yeah, you handle.
You handle the salad right now. I'm going.

1652
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:19,739
I'm going to cut rice.

1653
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:22,039
We are just getting my controls reversed.

1654
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:23,039
I can't stop going on.

1655
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,406
But your. Control servers,
we all have when.

1656
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:28,006
Literally I'm stuck
in the awkward position that way, OK?

1657
01:03:28,006 --> 01:03:30,290
I was I was going to be like, I got it.

1658
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,273
I think I think it bugged out.

1659
01:03:33,023 --> 01:03:34,590
I got to get the. Rice to get. Off.

1660
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,524
Right. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
OK, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1661
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,291
I'm going to plate one of them.

1662
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:41,641
All right.

1663
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:44,158
Now, just to prepare it. Let's try.

1664
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:46,108
So if we can get some cucumber,
that'll be great.

1665
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:47,725
Easier.

1666
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,375
Where is the cucumber?

1667
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:50,392
What the fuck?

1668
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:51,475
Where's the cucumber?

1669
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:53,308
Oh, it's the fucking tomato.

1670
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:54,409
Was covering the cucumber.

1671
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:55,075
There it is.

1672
01:03:55,075 --> 01:03:55,442
All right.

1673
01:03:55,442 --> 01:03:57,359
I was confused, I There we go.

1674
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,059
It's going to be OK.

1675
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:00,676
I'm going to send out this roll right now.

1676
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:02,843
I got some rice for you.

1677
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:04,460
I'm going to wash the dishes.

1678
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,543
Salad means you mean cucumber?

1679
01:04:05,543 --> 01:04:07,276
Cucumber for the salad.

1680
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:09,893
It's about to go bad.

1681
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:10,427
Come on, come on.

1682
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:12,777
Come on, pick it up. There we go.

1683
01:04:13,077 --> 01:04:14,161
It's doable.

1684
01:04:14,277 --> 01:04:17,011
So not there.

1685
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:19,428
We got lettuce and the another cucumber.

1686
01:04:19,678 --> 01:04:21,528
Another cucumber,

1687
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:22,828
other rice.

1688
01:04:22,828 --> 01:04:24,145
I'm going
get the rising and grab the rice.

1689
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:26,878
That rice is ready now.

1690
01:04:26,878 --> 01:04:29,395
He needs cucumber for that.

1691
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:31,129
Oh, my God.

1692
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:33,829
We need to make it. Yeah,
we need fish, too.

1693
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:34,696
What the fuck?

1694
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:37,613
Yeah, yeah, it's on the conveyor

1695
01:04:37,613 --> 01:04:38,480
Oh, no, we're out of beer.

1696
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,797
Out of plates. Right.
A plates on. Oh, shit.

1697
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,897
I mean, yeah, he's going to wash it
as a plate of hair.

1698
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,681
And of course, the acts of that.

1699
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:51,781
The rice is not looking so good. Yeah,
none of this is.

1700
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:55,048
We can't serve any of this, like,
until the whole time runs out.

1701
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:55,881
I don't think.

1702
01:04:57,831 --> 01:04:59,565
Who we got.

1703
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:00,682
We got 600, dude.

1704
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:02,332
We did great.

1705
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,749
We did so good. That was insane, man.

1706
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,099
My God, dude, what's going on?

1707
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:12,450
Like, our synergy, like, one up by hogging
some, like, a 100,000

1708
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,316
holy shed partners there.

1709
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,900
The onion man. He's so proud of us.

1710

Shit him bamboozled on. Yeah,

Stop, stop it.

1721
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:48,270
Oh, my God.

I'm trying to not you
you keep making me do these things, OK?

1723
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,087
And then.

1724
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,004
And then people keep thinking I'm a dog.

1725
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,571
I'm not human.

1726
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:58,737
It's bad.

1727
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:01,988

1729
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:06,355
It's hard. It's
hard. It's heart wrenching.

1730
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:08,005
You've only just begun.

1731
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,955
There's
still much to learn about cooperation.

1732
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:13,556
We can only keep you on bread back
so long and out into the wild country.

1733
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:15,406
I hear
there are flavours that I can say shake

1734
01:06:18,056 --> 01:06:18,556
back.

1735
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:21,290
I sure don't hurry me.

1736
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:22,940
But he's right.

1737
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,840
Let's go now.

1738
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,907
Bring back more delicious teen wild

1739
01:06:27,324 --> 01:06:29,124
delicious teamwork.

1740
01:06:29,157 --> 01:06:30,324
Teamwork.

1741
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:30,991
There's no time.

1742
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,057
To lose.

1743
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:35,274
Anyways.

1744
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:36,991
We did really good.

1745
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:37,491
Good.

1746
01:06:37,491 --> 01:06:40,558
We struggled like during the mids
middle portion.

1747
01:06:40,558 --> 01:06:41,808
But then we like, you know.

1748
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:44,775
We learn we learn to collaborate. Yeah.

1749
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:45,925
And to collaborate.

1750
01:06:45,925 --> 01:06:49,492
We learn to collaborate.

1751
01:06:50,759 --> 01:06:53,126
Or is this place going to the waters?

1752
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,926
Was that one from earlier this?

1753
01:06:54,926 --> 01:06:56,576
You really wanted something good? Woo!

1754
01:06:56,576 --> 01:06:59,160
I think we should try that again.
I think we've been doing a lot better.

1755
01:06:59,427 --> 01:07:00,743
I think we've been doing a lot better
since.

1756
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:03,327
We got the lowdown down.

1757
01:07:03,744 --> 01:07:05,177
People. And, like, this is.

1758
01:07:05,177 --> 01:07:08,511
Honestly, like,
it's still stressful as hell,

1759
01:07:08,928 --> 01:07:11,961
but is it, like, harder
when there's more people, like,

1760
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,695
it make the game gets harder
if there's more people.

1761
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,412
I don't honestly, I don't remember.

1762
01:07:15,412 --> 01:07:16,195
I think I played it with

1763
01:07:16,195 --> 01:07:18,562
for people before,
but I don't know how much hotter it goes.

1764
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:19,945
OK, ok.

1765
01:07:19,945 --> 01:07:20,995
Steam's right.

1766
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,112
OK, so remember you your job is to steam.

1767
01:07:24,112 --> 01:07:25,729
My job is to do the boiling.

1768
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:28,730
So if you put the bowls in the
middle so I can use the bowls

1769
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,630
and then once you steam together
you do the thing.

1770
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,080
So and then we've got to pay attention
to the oil.

1771
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,497
Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1772
01:07:37,497 --> 01:07:38,397
All right.

1773
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:39,647
Meat and flour.

1774
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,281
That's all we got to do.

1775
01:07:42,148 --> 01:07:43,331
Youngest. And I'm going.

1776
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:45,081
Put the fish over here.

1777
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:48,015
Put some flour right here

1778
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:48,865
where you've got.

1779
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:51,098
You've got chopping boards
on your size as well. So don't don't go.

1780
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:52,365
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true.

1781
01:07:52,365 --> 01:07:52,765
That's true.

1782
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:53,865
Give me that shit.

1783
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:56,116
Also, I need one more flour.

1784
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:57,149
Hold on, hold on.

1785
01:07:57,149 --> 01:08:01,116
Then I send it over
and suckin is your flour yes.

1786
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:02,250
You're going to steamed.

1787
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm going to steam the fish first.

1788
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:06,650
I got some to go. Some steam ship for you.

1789
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,017
There you go. Make sure to give me
the ball back when you're done. Yeah,

1790
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:12,834
I'm steaming fish first, though,
so once that's good.

1791
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:15,451
You go. Right, I'll send more flour.

1792
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:17,868
I'm just some more flour over
because I think you need more flour.

1793
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:19,835

1794
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:21,335
OK, thank you.

1795
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:26,035
We grab the fish, I'm playing the fish
and we'll put your report.

1796
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:27,735
Can you give me the bowls back? Yeah,
yeah.

1797
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:29,019
Hold on. I just got a gas.

1798
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:30,852
Send these orders out

1799
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:34,636

You need more flour?

1806
01:08:44,837 --> 01:08:47,487
I think you need more flour.
I know. I've got no flour for now.

1807
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:48,921
OK. OK, here's your dishes.

01:09:05,272 --> 01:09:07,739
Two balls of meats ready.

All right, good.
I'm going to do another dish.

1818
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:14,440
Mm hmm.

1819
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:19,107
Put these in and put this in.

1820
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:21,174
Here's your bowl, doc.
Thank you very much.

1821
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:25,858
And this can go
until there's another bowl back.

1822
01:09:25,858 --> 01:09:27,858
I go, I get some fish going.

1823
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:28,225
I'm going to.

1824
01:09:28,225 --> 01:09:29,075
Get a formal. Flour.

1825
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,175
Yeah, there's.

1826
01:09:30,175 --> 01:09:32,175
Yeah, there you go.

1827
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:33,558
I'm going to set to flour.

1828
01:09:33,558 --> 01:09:35,509
Is up, like, right here on this.

1829
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:38,009
And dirty dishes. Three dishes.

1830
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:40,226
So that was a burn.

1831
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:42,176
Yeah. These two are good. I'm going to.

1832
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:45,593
I'm going to send these out he's up

1833
01:09:46,110 --> 01:09:47,610
and then

1834
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,410
I think I can just sit it out.

1835
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,977
Yeah. And I prioritise the fish.

1836
01:09:52,977 --> 01:09:54,961
The fish are mommy. Mommy. All right,
all right, fish.

1837
01:09:54,961 --> 01:09:55,311
That's fine.

1838
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,777
The fun is always choice.

1839
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,861
First I'll do the dishes.

1840
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,878
I am, I have my job.

1841
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:00,178
I can't,

1842
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:03,178
I don't really have a job for
a little bit, but just make sure you also

1843
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:05,212
do one of those
and then you should be good.

1844
01:10:05,212 --> 01:10:08,062
Yeah, clean the plates in the meantime.
Very young.

1845
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:09,045
Lady. More plates.

1846
01:10:09,045 --> 01:10:11,029
Well. Nice.

1847
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:14,729
OK, and then you go more flour.

1848
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:17,829
And you go. And say, good.

1849
01:10:18,863 --> 01:10:21,380
Oof! OK.

1850
01:10:22,897 --> 01:10:24,530
A bowls back, please.

1851
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,497
Yeah, yeah,
I'm about to send that in on block

1852
01:10:30,597 --> 01:10:30,847
here.

1853
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:31,998
Go for bowls.

1854
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:34,348
Good bowls. Good. Well,
that will happen to the onion king.

1855
01:10:34,348 --> 01:10:36,348
Just give me a little bit stimulation.

1856
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:38,932
Yeah, I don't know. I just. I got stuck.

1857
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:40,765
That's stuck, bro.

1858
01:10:40,765 --> 01:10:42,182
Stop up.

1859
01:10:43,815 --> 01:10:44,482
Plate. That's it.

1860
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:47,866
Now you got it with some fish order.

1861
01:10:48,682 --> 01:10:51,466
Yeah. One that's ready to go.

1862
01:10:51,466 --> 01:10:53,666
I just need more plates. Here
you go. Here's 30 plates.

1863
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:56,067
I may get some more fish ready.

1864
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:57,450
I'm going to give you another flour.

1865
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,067
Actually, I think you need more flour.

1866
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:01,367
Yeah, this would be good. Yeah.

1867
01:11:01,367 --> 01:11:04,967
OK. Bowls back on the dinner plate ASAP.

1868
01:11:05,984 --> 01:11:06,684
There we go.

1869
01:11:06,684 --> 01:11:10,585
There's more flour. Are

1870
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:12,918
when we got that music speeding up?

1871
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:14,602
It's is going
faster and faster. Going fast.

1872
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:17,419
All right, I've got to play for you.

1873
01:11:17,419 --> 01:11:18,435
Make sure you play some of these.

1874
01:11:18,435 --> 01:11:19,219
Something's right away, guys.

1875
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:20,602
I'm guessing it's about a.

1876
01:11:20,602 --> 01:11:22,769
Serve it to serve it.

1877
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:23,936
Something's going bad.

1878
01:11:23,936 --> 01:11:26,670
Something's going back to

1879
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:28,670
where. Almost wants to get three stars.

1880
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,887
If you want more. Oh,
my God. Oh, my God. I can't.

1881
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:31,770
I don't have enough time.

1882
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,270
I don't have enough time.

1883
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,521
Fuck.

1884
01:11:36,521 --> 01:11:39,487
Fuck. Oh, we're literally 15 seconds.

1885
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:42,688
My God. Let's do that again.
Yeah, I think.

1886
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:44,505
I think we got it this time.
We got this time.

1887
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:46,555
We had a good run. Yeah, yeah. OK.

1888
01:11:46,555 --> 01:11:49,255
Oh. Damn him.

1889
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:51,439
In a little.

1890
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,539
They called me. They called me the chef.

1891
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:54,589
They called me too. Shit.

1892
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:56,656
Because I fucking fucking.

1893
01:11:56,656 --> 01:11:58,156
Bother, chef.

1894
01:11:58,673 --> 01:12:00,323
Oh, hold on.

1895
01:12:00,323 --> 01:12:01,856
Matsu. The universe.

1896
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:02,240
Thank you guys.

1897
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,673
So much for all the gifts, subs holy shit.

1898
01:12:05,457 --> 01:12:06,357
Oh, my God.

1899
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,190
You good?

1900
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,257
Yeah, I'm good. So is someone just.
People are.

1901
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:12,324
There's a lot of gift subs going on right
now, so.

1902
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:14,741
Say some. Income for you guys. Asians.

1903
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:15,774
That's OK.

1904
01:12:15,924 --> 01:12:16,458
All right.

1905
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,408
Same rules as last time. We're good. OK.

1906
01:12:18,408 --> 01:12:20,025
Yeah, we got it. We got it.

1907
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,592
I just make sure to be
a little quicker on the fish.

1908
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:24,175
We should be fine. Yeah,
the fish is also really important.

1909
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:26,992
I'm going to just throw flour immediately
towards you.

1910
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:29,059
Since that's. Important. Go there.

1911
01:12:29,059 --> 01:12:29,759
And I'm going to get.

1912
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,793
I'm going to get some fish chops.

1913
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:34,943
I feel like I get pretty up
these fish, so.

1914
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:38,160
Yeah, yeah, I know that is a good idea
when they know when you don't have

1915
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,593
anything else to do.

1916
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,794
You could do with getting some fish tied
right away.

1917
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:47,244
Yeah, I'm putting them in a sub right now

1918
01:12:49,128 --> 01:12:49,528
in the chop.

1919
01:12:49,528 --> 01:12:52,795
More fish do you need more flour?

1920
01:12:53,128 --> 01:12:55,095
I think you do.
I know I'm all good for flour right now.

1921
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:57,045
I just set it up to set it up.

1922
01:12:57,045 --> 01:12:59,279
Yeah. One more flour.

01:12:59,329 --> 01:13:00,712

All Wait.
I think I got a system whole long way.

1926
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,613
I just put it on the plate
and then take this and your bowls.

1927
01:13:07,829 --> 01:13:10,696
I don't even need to grab the bowls.

1928
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:11,780
Oh, share.

1929
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,563

Oh, no. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

There you go.

1940
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:32,099
Yeah, I accidentally put the fish
in with the meat and stuff.

1941
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:33,799

All around.

2044
01:17:29,055 --> 01:17:30,439
You just run somebody over again.

2045
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:32,572
Always on. I'll run you over.

2046
01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:34,856
I will. Yeah.

01:17:35,806 --> 01:17:36,656
Oh, yeah.

2048
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:41,806
Vox He keeps saying you're going to
do these things, but then you never.

2049
01:17:42,106 --> 01:17:44,090
You never come through with it.

2050
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,557
I don't know if you can handle them.

2051
01:17:45,557 --> 01:17:48,057
You always you. Know. That's how I know.

2052
01:17:48,057 --> 01:17:49,790
But no. No, if you really, you.

2053
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,674
Know, it's, you know,
they say actions speak louder than words.

2054
01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:54,141
I'm not seeing a lot of action.

2055
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,274
I'm just hearing
a lot of are hearing a lot of

2056
01:17:57,358 --> 01:17:59,275
honey and and like,

2057
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:03,475
blubbery, whatever you fucking call it,
blubbering, blubbery.

2058
01:18:03,742 --> 01:18:05,725
Blubbering, all right.

2059
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:06,325
All right, well,

2060
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:10,909
next up, next time I see you, I shall run
you over in my 1994 Honda Civic.

2061
01:18:10,909 --> 01:18:12,226
How does that sound?

2062
01:18:13,726 --> 01:18:14,510
Honda Civic.

2063
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,860
That's going to hurt.

2064
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,543
Yeah. That's going to. Hurt.

2065
01:18:17,543 --> 01:18:20,927
Are you sure you don't
want me to be all talk.

2066
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,244
I mean I thought you were,
I thought this is a euphemism

2067
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:25,044
for something else.

2068
01:18:26,394 --> 01:18:27,477
Like you said.

2069
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:29,128
Oh yeah.

2070
01:18:29,128 --> 01:18:31,561
And you said, you said like oh
when you go actually going to run me over.

2071
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,628
And I was like all right,
I suppose I will go and grab my Honda

2072
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:35,728
Civic and I will run you down
in the middle of the street until we.

2073
01:18:35,728 --> 01:18:37,345
Get into the parking lot right.

2074
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,962
In the middle of the road. You little.

2075
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:39,329
All right.

2076
01:18:39,329 --> 01:18:41,779
I guess if you. Can't hold to
your convictions, then I guess, you know.

2077
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:43,846
I had a nightmare about you last night.

2078
01:18:44,362 --> 01:18:45,296
Oh, my God. Really?

2079
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:47,846
Yeah. A nightmare about you
is that it's not real.

2080
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:49,163
Oh, my God. No, it was real.

2081
01:18:49,163 --> 01:18:49,913
It was actually real.

2082
01:18:49,913 --> 01:18:51,746
So I woke up. No, I woke up.

2083
01:18:51,746 --> 01:18:53,180
So what was happening? Like,

2084
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,197
I think

2085
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:58,464
it was, like, premeditation, like,
whatever it was like in preparation

2086
01:18:58,464 --> 01:19:00,981
for the collar in my head,
whatever was happening,

2087
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:04,098
you were stuffing raw shrimp
into your pants, right?

2088
01:19:04,248 --> 01:19:05,998
Like you were putting
some into your apron.

2089
01:19:05,998 --> 01:19:07,798
So you, like, your apron had pockets,

2090
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:10,765
but you also were putting some
into your pants for some goddamn reason,

2091
01:19:10,915 --> 01:19:13,649
but you were also yelling at me
and calling me a dildo.

2092
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:15,265
So that's why I called you a dildo today.

2093
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:17,032
Because you kept calling me one of my.

2094

I'm bloody trying to build up an immunity.

2106
01:19:43,102 --> 01:19:45,268
Immunity to white.

01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:47,335

2110
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:52,586
Oh, you don't like shrimp?

It tastes. Tastes like tastes like arse.

2113
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,970
You don't know what real arse tastes like.

2114
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,970
You know, we find out.

2115
01:20:02,337 --> 01:20:04,554

2116
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,170
I don't want to help you find out.

2117
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,671

I wish I could help, but I can't.

2141
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:03,109
I'm just saying. You really can't. OK?

2142
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:04,276

I don't know.

2153
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:28,612
You said it all here.

2154
01:21:28,612 --> 01:21:31,879
Like, there was a one Sunday night
when there's, like, 2 seconds left.

Yeah, I think we can do it.

2164
01:21:47,964 --> 01:21:50,181
I wish I got a whole lot more light

01:21:50,181 --> 01:21:50,731
You don't need.

We just need one more dish.

2224
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:56,726
I think we just need one more dish.

01:23:57,676 --> 01:23:59,027
Yeah.

2226
01:23:59,027 --> 01:23:59,960

Oh. Oh, there's those potatoes

Potato. I mean, there's no time.

2236
01:24:19,395 --> 01:24:21,495
Why do you do this every single time?

2237
01:24:21,495 --> 01:24:23,579
You beggin for water?
We still got three freestyle.

2238
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:27,896
You let me throw an ingredient
at the last few seconds expecting me

2239
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,296
like you expecting it?
Do something with it.

2240
01:24:30,296 --> 01:24:31,830
It's so far.

2241
01:24:33,213 --> 01:24:34,647
We still got three stars is fine.

2242
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:35,297

2243
01:24:35,297 --> 01:24:35,964
That was all me.

2244
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:38,847
You just have to chop
and somebody that was old negro.

2245
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:39,831
This is OK.

2246
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:43,181
Well, if I didn't chop those ingredients
for you, then, you know.

2247
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:45,498
You know, if I didn't if I didn't.

2248
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:48,865
Cook plate, throw and serve all of them.

2249
01:24:48,865 --> 01:24:50,998
Come on, now.
There's only two ingredients to work on.

2250
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:53,149
If I was ever really that hard.

2251
01:24:53,149 --> 01:24:55,665
Oh, my finger keeps like, oh, yes.

2252
01:24:55,665 --> 01:24:57,349
I don't know. I don't know.

2253
01:24:57,349 --> 01:24:59,416
I think it just keeps, like,
defaulting to the spacebar.

2254
01:24:59,816 --> 01:25:01,549
Oh, OK.

2255
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:03,383
So now we got.

2256
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:05,366

Yeah.
Work with father throwing method now.

2258
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:08,867

01:25:09,867 --> 01:25:11,784
that's why it's sight to do that, right?

2260
01:25:11,784 --> 01:25:14,634

01:25:28,635 --> 01:25:29,219
I don't think so.

2269
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:32,069
I think it because we're in an RV and
we're in like the middle of the desert.

2270
01:25:32,069 --> 01:25:32,669
I'll be like.

2271
01:25:32,686 --> 01:25:35,519
You know, we need to cook.

2272
01:25:35,519 --> 01:25:36,986
We all know where you want to cook.

2273
01:25:36,986 --> 01:25:37,553
What do you want to cook?

2274
01:25:37,553 --> 01:25:41,420
Did show, though we need to make fries.

2275
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,837
Is this a reference on missing.

2276
01:25:44,837 --> 01:25:46,170
Fucking breaking bad.

2277
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:47,971
Shoulder? I've never watched Breaking Bad.

2278
01:25:47,971 --> 01:25:48,871
Oh, you've. Never watched it?

2279
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:50,788
All right, well,
this is literally like the first episode.

2280
01:25:50,788 --> 01:25:52,438
They go
they go and they cook it, like, in,

2281
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:55,071
like, the RV out in the desert,
and he's like, oh, I think we.

2282
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:56,871
Have to cook just like you.

2283
01:25:56,871 --> 01:25:58,438
OK, you see,
this is now. That's where I'm at.

2284
01:25:58,438 --> 01:26:00,288
Wait, there's only one star here?

2285
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,705
Oh, no, I'm dumb.

2286
01:26:01,705 --> 01:26:04,372
Ignore me. You're me. Yeah. That's right.

2287
01:26:04,372 --> 01:26:06,506
There's three. Whoa.

2288
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:07,823
All right, pasta.

2289
01:26:07,823 --> 01:26:09,889
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

2290
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,423
I passed that pasta going

2291
01:26:12,956 --> 01:26:15,173
to throw me as many ingredients as you
can. Huh?

2292
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:18,324
Uh huh. Fish, fish going.

2293
01:26:18,324 --> 01:26:19,824
Fish, fish, fish is going.

2294
01:26:19,824 --> 01:26:22,257
Fish is going is going fried chicken over.

2295
01:26:22,707 --> 01:26:23,507
I'm just going to keep chopping.

2296
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:24,291
You know, I have a lot.

2297
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,258
Of shit to chop,

2298
01:26:25,258 --> 01:26:27,341
so I'm just going to chop a bunch of shit
and throw it over to you.

2299
01:26:27,341 --> 01:26:29,575
Go bubble up.

2300
01:26:30,008 --> 01:26:31,975
We need shrimp. You need shrimp.

2301
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:33,108
Shrimp would be nice.

2302
01:26:33,108 --> 01:26:36,592
OK, thank you.

2303
01:26:37,075 --> 01:26:37,559
All right.

2304
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:39,526
Chicken

2305
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:40,742
fried

2306
01:26:42,026 --> 01:26:43,826
hey, go.

2307
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,260
Chicken pasta.

2308
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,843
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2309
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:48,827
Ow, ow.

2310
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,427
Yes. I'm Bo.

2311
01:26:50,427 --> 01:26:52,627
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going,
I'm going. I'm serving. I'm serving you.

2312
01:26:52,644 --> 01:26:53,477
I'm serving

2313
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:54,744
it served.

2314
01:26:54,744 --> 01:26:57,227
It's served as a chop chop more.

2315
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:00,511
Oh, fuck. Wait. Oh, God. This is a lot.

2316
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:03,345
There is a lot to do here.

2317
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:05,778
Oh, my God. I'm stuck. No.

2318
01:27:06,495 --> 01:27:09,345
You're fucking my sous chef.

2319
01:27:09,345 --> 01:27:10,695
It's fucking dead.

2320
01:27:10,695 --> 01:27:12,862
Oh, no, I'm back. I'm back.

2321
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:15,079
And I'm a magician.

2322
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:15,596
Here you go.

2323
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:17,479
I didn't know
you could die in this fucking game.

2324
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:19,230
All right? Pasta has to pass the pasta.

2325
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:22,397
I sample slice
and passed that over our pasta.

2326
01:27:22,397 --> 01:27:24,380
Thank you. Send pasta.

2327
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,880
Some pasta.

2328
01:27:26,747 --> 01:27:28,097
I'm stuck again.

2329
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:29,181
Oh, God.

2330
01:27:30,447 --> 01:27:32,998
My plates, please.

2331
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:33,881
Goodness.

2332
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:35,031
Do. This is.

2333
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:37,665
Bad. Like it, like, is really wrong.

2334
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:41,398
It makes me stranded on the other side,
and I can't do anything by plates.

2335
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:45,832
Fish and shrimp.

2336
01:27:45,832 --> 01:27:47,149
There we go. There we go. There
we go. That's fine.

2337
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:48,866
That's that's that's playable.

2338
01:27:48,866 --> 01:27:50,716
That's playable. This one and this one.

2339
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:51,916
One of the top. Send it, send it.

2340
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,566
OK, ok. OK.
I'm going to send it. I'm just.

2341
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:54,916
I'm going over. I'm going over.

2342
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:56,517
I should. I could throw the pool.

2343
01:27:56,517 --> 01:27:58,650
Can I just. I mean, since I need
some shrimp and some shrimp.

2344
01:27:59,717 --> 01:28:00,500
Shrimp, you know, shrimp.

2345
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,067
OK, there's.

2346
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,150
No way to put. Anything.

2347
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:04,067
Yeah, there's there way.

2348
01:28:04,067 --> 01:28:06,451
There's a lot of space over here,
to be honest.

2349
01:28:06,751 --> 01:28:07,668
There's no where to.

2350
01:28:07,668 --> 01:28:10,468
Fucking put anything on the go.

2351
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:11,418
OK? Shrimp is cooking.

2352
01:28:11,418 --> 01:28:12,985
Shrimp is cooking.

2353
01:28:14,285 --> 01:28:14,968
There you go.

2354
01:28:14,968 --> 01:28:17,485
I thought that was cooked. Oh,
my God, I'm fucking up.

2355
01:28:17,485 --> 01:28:18,919
Shrimps cooking. Shrimp is cooking.

2356
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:21,019
OK, I'm
not saying you don't. I'm saying it over.

2357
01:28:21,169 --> 01:28:21,852
Saying over.

2358
01:28:21,852 --> 01:28:23,086
All Alyssa, send it.

2359
01:28:23,086 --> 01:28:25,336
You've got the fucking roll pan
in your hand.

2360
01:28:25,336 --> 01:28:28,453
Wait, what the. Oh, oh.

2361
01:28:28,486 --> 01:28:30,837
What happened? Oh, my God.

2362
01:28:30,837 --> 01:28:32,337
Strangely, I could not tell you.

2363
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:33,387
All right, well, both were both crap.

2364
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:35,120
We can't get anymore, so.

2365
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:37,671
I'm just gonna put more this.

2366
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:39,804
Pots. OK? Oh, my God.

2367
01:28:39,804 --> 01:28:42,504
I put the fucking plate on the chopping
board. What am I doing

2368
01:28:45,138 --> 01:28:46,338
Pasta, pasta.

2369
01:28:46,338 --> 01:28:47,272
Pasta to me.

2370
01:28:47,272 --> 01:28:50,305
Speak to me tonight.
It's amazing you to me.

2371
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:51,989
I got more. Pasta, grandma. Pasta.

2372
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:54,022
Easy, easy game.

2373
01:28:54,406 --> 01:28:55,556
All right, shrimp.

2374
01:28:55,556 --> 01:28:57,356
We meet pasta.

2375
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:01,556
I'm going to put this on the on salting.

2376
01:29:01,556 --> 01:29:02,873
I'm salting.

2377
01:29:02,873 --> 01:29:03,806
He's salting.

2378
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,307
This motherfucker is so.

2379
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:09,657
And isn't
that what you're supposed to do? No,

2380
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:13,707
I tossed the fucking pasta off the do.

2381
01:29:13,707 --> 01:29:14,508
This is so.

2382
01:29:14,508 --> 01:29:17,391
Dharma, what is. Happening now?

2383
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:20,058
Pasta.
Pasta. Pasta for pasta for you, chef.

2384
01:29:20,058 --> 01:29:21,108
I don't know what to do.

2385
01:29:21,108 --> 01:29:23,308
I don't know if you did.

2386
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,875
Did you die or you died?

2387
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,442
Oh, no.
Everything burned. Everything burned.

2388
01:29:27,442 --> 01:29:28,309
OK, ok.

2389
01:29:28,309 --> 01:29:29,726
OK, let's roll it back.

2390
01:29:29,726 --> 01:29:31,643
Let's roll it back a bit.

2391
01:29:32,109 --> 01:29:34,376
We're kind of. We got frazzled.

2392
01:29:34,376 --> 01:29:36,476
We got, you know, flustered.

2393
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:38,877
It's a lot going on at once. Feel

2394
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:42,860
what do they want us to get?

2395
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,227
480 points. Holy shit.

2396
01:29:45,227 --> 01:29:46,494
Oh, my God.

2397
01:29:48,678 --> 01:29:50,628
Listen, with a plan, this will work.

2398
01:29:50,628 --> 01:29:53,395
I think that the issue
there are two issues with this one,

2399
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:57,562
not enough ingredients are coming out
because we keep getting stuck on one side.

2400
01:29:57,628 --> 01:30:00,795
Yes. Secondly,
not enough space to put, you know, what.

2401
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:01,545
I think is a good idea.

2402
01:30:01,545 --> 01:30:04,279
We should just like, hog
all the ingredients from that one side

2403
01:30:04,462 --> 01:30:05,179
because, like, it's.

2404
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:07,879
Literally on the left
and just whole ingredients that you

2405
01:30:09,046 --> 01:30:10,946
OK and then you'll have everything
you need.

2406
01:30:10,946 --> 01:30:11,363
OK, OK.

2407
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:14,530
I'll just ricotta what the menu is
and immediately drop everything.

2408
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,130
Great. Yeah. Yes, yes.

2409
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:16,797
I think

2410
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:20,147
I'll grab
I'll grab some stuff pre-emptively though.

2411
01:30:20,147 --> 01:30:21,031
Like this.

2412
01:30:21,031 --> 01:30:22,548
Like a good idea to pasta.

2413
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:24,414
Like we need a box on the pasta that.

2414
01:30:24,414 --> 01:30:26,481
Yeah. Just throw all the plastic.

2415
01:30:26,481 --> 01:30:27,531
Throw all the possible.

2416
01:30:27,531 --> 01:30:28,698
But could.

2417
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:30,465
Literally just fuck this.

2418
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:33,549
Side of the map specifically it's.

2419
01:30:33,549 --> 01:30:35,715
The ocean oddly blocked me with that.

2420
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:38,416
Like I couldn't
even get all. My cutaway here right

2421
01:30:40,866 --> 01:30:41,666
OK. All right.

2422
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:43,516
I got the pasta going.

2423
01:30:43,516 --> 01:30:45,016
Possibly.

2424
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,483
We got going too fast for a lifetime.

2425
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:48,150
Yeah,

2426
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:51,800
it's an Italian woman's kitchen right now.

2427
01:30:52,617 --> 01:30:55,801
That's feeling
that I got to make the best.

2428
01:30:58,068 --> 01:30:58,968
Did you hear about,

2429
01:30:58,968 --> 01:31:02,301
like, the fact that, oh, you know,
have you seen the video of, like,

2430
01:31:02,501 --> 01:31:05,602
the Italian, the old Italian guy,
like, complaining that there's no fish

2431
01:31:06,602 --> 01:31:09,569
oh, that was the one thing
I've got to get.

2432
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:11,369
To take it off. It's about the one.

2433
01:31:11,369 --> 01:31:12,269
Take it off.

2434
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:13,936
I can't. I can't.

2435
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:15,203
I can't. I can't. I can't. Oh, no.

2436
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,686
Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm a vox rocks.
Fuck. Oh, God.

2437
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:18,886
I think the fire extinguisher.

2438
01:31:18,886 --> 01:31:21,120
Where's the fire. Extinguisher?

2439
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:23,070
It's with you. It's with me.

2440
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,170
Or is it? Oh, no.

2441
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:27,204
I don't know. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

2442
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:28,854
I can't find the fire extinguisher.

2443
01:31:30,221 --> 01:31:32,371
Bro. Well, this has not worked.

2444
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:35,271
Oh, no. Everything's everything's burning

2445
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:36,888
VOCs. Everything's burning.

2446
01:31:36,888 --> 01:31:38,838
Where's the fire extinguisher?

2447
01:31:38,838 --> 01:31:41,055
I genuinely don't know. I'm
looking at my fucking God.

2448
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:42,889
I can't see anything. I don't.

2449
01:31:42,889 --> 01:31:45,539
We do so much pasta
why it so much pasta everywhere?

2450
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:46,972
Oh, I could not tell.

2451
01:31:46,972 --> 01:31:48,956
I could not fucking tell you.

2452
01:31:48,956 --> 01:31:49,406
Voxer.

2453
01:31:49,406 --> 01:31:50,339
So we agree.

2454
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,090
It's how we.

2455
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:56,240
I'm oh, I can't find the fire
extinguisher box.

2456
01:31:56,507 --> 01:31:57,540
Oh, don't you?

2457
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,224
Oh, it's right here.

2458
01:31:58,224 --> 01:32:00,324
Right here. Oh.

2459
01:32:03,174 --> 01:32:06,358
You need you need to stop

2460
01:32:06,508 --> 01:32:09,475
pushing yourself to orgasm
every time there's a slight inconvenience.

2461
01:32:09,975 --> 01:32:11,308
I was panicking, OK?

2462
01:32:11,308 --> 01:32:12,592
I was panicking. I was panicking.

2463
01:32:12,592 --> 01:32:13,108
I was panicking.

2464
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:16,159
Sounded like. You're being stimulated.

2465
01:32:16,342 --> 01:32:18,259
I mean, you're here so

2466
01:32:18,392 --> 01:32:18,976
hard. Knocks it.

2467
01:32:18,976 --> 01:32:19,859
All right, all right, all right.

2468
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:21,976
This place may be burning down, but,
you know, you fly, right?

2469
01:32:21,976 --> 01:32:23,309
We'll get you everyone a flutter.

2470
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,626
Everything's dead.

2471
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:29,027
VOCs. I think we got to restart this one.

2472
01:32:29,027 --> 01:32:31,227
We failed so hard early on.

2473
01:32:31,227 --> 01:32:32,310
All right, now.

2474
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:34,427
Look at my side of the kitchen.

2475
01:32:34,427 --> 01:32:37,861
Is going to make sure
that there's enough space to put shifts

2476
01:32:37,861 --> 01:32:40,011
so that you can take shit off
the grill, ok? OK.

2477
01:32:40,261 --> 01:32:41,694
The fire. OK.

2478
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:42,511
All right.

2479
01:32:42,778 --> 01:32:42,945
All right.

2480
01:32:42,945 --> 01:32:44,061
Yeah, you do the thing with the pasta.

2481
01:32:44,061 --> 01:32:45,562
I'll start chopping

2482
01:32:50,179 --> 01:32:51,595

2483
01:32:51,595 --> 01:32:52,846
Bombardment.

2484
01:32:53,429 --> 01:32:55,496
And any more. Pasta is one of each.

2485
01:32:55,496 --> 01:32:58,679
One of each ok. OK,

2486
01:32:58,679 --> 01:32:59,363

2491
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,330
Wait, hold on. Wait.
There is the meat. OK?

2492
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:10,464
No, you need to chop the meat,

2493
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:12,781
OK, ok.

01:34:13,637 --> 01:34:14,737
We just, we just.

2526
01:34:14,854 --> 01:34:16,120

01:34:33,105 --> 01:34:35,122
It burned, it burned, it burned. It

2538
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:37,556
It fucking burned alive. That's fine.

You go.

2545
01:34:50,207 --> 01:34:51,391
OK, this passes.

2546

Oh, my God.

01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:08,926
We thought that wasn't cooked.
It wasn't cooked.

2555
01:35:08,926 --> 01:35:10,426
It wasn't cooked.

2556
01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:13,309
Oh, my God.

2557
01:35:13,309 --> 01:35:15,076

Everything's everywhere.

Everything is everywhere.

2577
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,246
Everything. Everywhere.

2578
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,447
All the time.

2579
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:56,547
OK, ok. This is right. It is right.

2580
01:35:56,547 --> 01:36:00,447
Not don't grab the fucking dumb arse. OK?

OK, let me send this over

All we need 400. OK, ok. OK.

2585
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:11,148
See, this is fine.
This is fine. I reckon we could do it.

2586
01:36:11,148 --> 01:36:12,982
Do would you like me to do more for you?

2587
01:36:12,982 --> 01:36:15,199
Because I feel like. I mean, maybe. Maybe.

2588
01:36:15,465 --> 01:36:16,616
I don't.

2589
01:36:17,099 --> 01:36:17,699
Know.

2590
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:19,699
I think I just fucked up a lot.

2591
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:22,366
I just fucked up a lot there.

2592
01:36:22,366 --> 01:36:23,966
OK, because there's so much.

2593
01:36:23,966 --> 01:36:26,216
There's not enough space. There's like,
no tables.

2594
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:29,100
It's like, puts down the.
I think we can do this.

01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,700
I think we can do this. OK, ok,
we can do this.

2596
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,751
It's good to keep practising.
Yeah, you got it.

2597
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:36,751
We got it. Easy peasy.

2598
01:36:36,751 --> 01:36:37,668
I'm going to grab it now.

2599
01:36:37,668 --> 01:36:40,218
There's so much food. On the floor.

2600
01:36:40,218 --> 01:36:40,851
I couldn't.

2601
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:43,552
I was like, glued trudging through a pile.

2602
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:44,885
This game is.

2603
01:36:44,885 --> 01:36:46,919
Making me hungry.
Excuse me. Making me hungry.

2604
01:36:47,335 --> 01:36:47,935
Nice. Try this again.

2605
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:50,236
And you just have lunch.

2606
01:36:50,236 --> 01:36:51,469
What do you have for lunch, by the way?

2607
01:36:51,469 --> 01:36:53,903
I had some fried rice. Oh, egg fried rice.

2608
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:55,436
Chicken fried rice.

2609
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:56,886
Actually, you know,

2610
01:36:57,803 --> 01:37:01,803
yeah. OK.

2611
01:37:02,903 --> 01:37:04,470
All right, we're not cooking.

2612
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:07,137
OK? I'm
going to get the pasta going right now.

2613
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:10,321
Oh, thank you, my stars.

2614
01:37:10,321 --> 01:37:12,504
Thank you. I've been called an expert.

2615
01:37:12,504 --> 01:37:13,921
I need. I need meats. I need meat.

2616
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:15,838
Not not shrimp, but.

2617
01:37:15,838 --> 01:37:17,305
Yeah, yeah, like two meats.

2618
01:37:17,305 --> 01:37:18,805
I need two meats.

2619
01:37:20,205 --> 01:37:20,688
Always my one.

2620
01:37:20,688 --> 01:37:21,405
Not enough.

2621
01:37:22,772 --> 01:37:24,656
No, it's not enough, actually.

2622
01:37:24,656 --> 01:37:26,422
Oh, why don't you want to hear?

2623
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:28,489
Jesus Christ, this is the fucking kitchen.

2624
01:37:29,389 --> 01:37:30,839
What oh!

2625
01:37:30,839 --> 01:37:32,440
Oh, God.

2626
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,540
OK, Elizabeth, those meats are going.

2627
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:36,757
This is ready. Order! Order!

2628
01:37:36,757 --> 01:37:37,373

01:37:37,373 --> 01:37:40,190
Yep. Yeah,

2630
01:37:40,457 --> 01:37:40,790
I got

2631
01:37:46,008 --> 01:37:46,741

I think I need. I think.

2633
01:37:48,325 --> 01:37:50,425
I think you actually know
this is good to go.

2634
01:37:51,058 --> 01:37:52,725
You could go

2635
01:37:55,075 --> 01:37:55,525
it's possible.

2636
01:37:55,525 --> 01:37:56,992
Just need to go in. OK?

2637
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,942
I'm not send you another meat pasta.

2638
01:37:58,942 --> 01:38:01,759
Oh, there you go. Oh.

2639
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:02,826
You got enough fish? Yeah.

01:38:02,826 --> 01:38:04,509
You got. You.

2641
01:38:04,509 --> 01:38:05,476
I don't think.

2642
01:38:05,476 --> 01:38:08,310
So. This little fish I need up.

2643
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,743
This isn't chopped.

01:38:09,743 --> 01:38:12,810
Hold on. I have my I got you.

01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:14,627
Throw it right onto the board.

Going again?

2647
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:18,261
Yeah. Oh.

2648
01:38:18,928 --> 01:38:20,728
Dude, look at our synergy girl.

2649
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,228
There we go.

2650
01:38:28,395 --> 01:38:30,629
OK, and then I need a shrimp.

2651
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:32,896
Shrimp is almost done.
Shrimp is almost done.

2652
01:38:32,896 --> 01:38:34,646
And you smell me

2653
01:38:35,663 --> 01:38:37,429
do you mean pasta? Next, if you can.

2654
01:38:37,429 --> 01:38:38,779
Perfect. Perfect. Give me that. Yeah.

2655
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:41,180
Excellent, excellent.

Yeah.

2657
01:38:44,247 --> 01:38:47,997
Played pretty quick,
but then I just put it down.

2658
01:38:47,997 --> 01:38:48,330
I don't know.

2659
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:50,664
I'll put it down there into Salty.

2660
01:38:50,664 --> 01:38:51,631
There we. Go.

2661
01:38:53,214 --> 01:38:54,781
Fish for you.

I think you need to. Hold on, hold on.

2667
01:39:03,682 --> 01:39:05,749
I need more pasta.
I don't like a million pasta.

2668
01:39:05,799 --> 01:39:07,916
I'll plate this and I'll give you pasta.

2669
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,316
We might miss that one, but we still got
a whole minute left, so it should be fine.

2670
01:39:11,266 --> 01:39:14,250
OK. Are

01:39:30,168 --> 01:39:31,668
Now I need to get some pasta.

01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,957
No, it's not.
We have one. More. Oh, my God. Yes.

2712
01:40:31,991 --> 01:40:34,441
So you need one more pasta.

Maybe not all.

Are you eating?

01:43:41,759 --> 01:43:43,009
OK. This sore.

2795
01:43:43,009 --> 01:43:45,276
This one's ready. There you go.

2796
01:43:45,276 --> 01:43:46,226
For. It.

2797
01:43:46,226 --> 01:43:48,510
And more regular pasta.
And here it is. OK.

2798
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,727
What happened to my, uh.

2799
01:43:50,727 --> 01:43:52,794
We might have to ignore that. That
that pasta.

2800
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:55,160
What do you go?
Go ahead with a meat pasta. OK.

2801
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,477
I'll often pass that fork.

2802
01:43:57,477 --> 01:43:59,911
I keep, I get my finger
keeps resting on the bottom.

2803
01:43:59,928 --> 01:44:02,011
I don't have any meat over
here, by the way.

2804
01:44:02,011 --> 01:44:04,678
I'll make any. One, but

2805
01:44:06,145 --> 01:44:08,428
I keep sending you some fish

2806
01:44:11,195 --> 01:44:11,779
yeah, we got time.

2807
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:12,629
We got time.

2808
01:44:13,946 --> 01:44:15,262
To do some fish pasta. About what?

2809
01:44:15,262 --> 01:44:17,363
That first one has three
bars. That'll be a good tip.

2810
01:44:17,363 --> 01:44:18,629
OK, ok. OK,

2811
01:44:19,763 --> 01:44:20,396
I'll try.

2812
01:44:20,396 --> 01:44:21,413
I'll try

2813
01:44:22,647 --> 01:44:23,997
I don't know.

2814
01:44:23,997 --> 01:44:24,947
I'll know. Here we go.

2815
01:44:24,947 --> 01:44:25,447
Here we go.

2816
01:44:25,447 --> 01:44:28,947
I oh, my God.

2817
01:44:29,447 --> 01:44:31,097
OK, you got it. You got it. You got it.

2818
01:44:31,097 --> 01:44:33,264
No, it's not enough. It's not enough. It's
not enough.

2819
01:44:33,714 --> 01:44:35,148
Oh, my gosh.

2820
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:37,065
This bar is hard.

2821
01:44:37,098 --> 01:44:38,998
It's actually quite a challenge.

2822
01:44:38,998 --> 01:44:41,815
What do we do
or how do we improve on this?

2823
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:43,499
I think we just have to be cleaner
about it.

2824
01:44:43,499 --> 01:44:48,116
So the mistake I made that time, it was
I didn't throw you an off me.

2825
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:51,349
And then there was like, told me pasta
get made, so I'll just make all go on.

2826
01:44:51,349 --> 01:44:52,733
Like, let's do it again.

2827
01:44:52,733 --> 01:44:54,350
I'll go on like a rotation.

2828
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:54,533
All right.

2829
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:56,800
OK, got it. Oh.

2830
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,200
I don't like rotations.
I'll do meat. Fish.

2831
01:45:00,534 --> 01:45:03,267
So the knuckleball,
I had the keyboard controls

2832
01:45:03,317 --> 01:45:06,984
trying to, like, pick things up,
like the specific it's annoying.

2833
01:45:06,984 --> 01:45:07,251
Yeah,

2834
01:45:08,718 --> 01:45:11,451
OK. Oh.

2835
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:12,385
I remember lesson. I played this.

2836
01:45:12,385 --> 01:45:15,352
It was on switch
the controls to really get that

2837
01:45:15,352 --> 01:45:17,002
all right you do pasta.

2838
01:45:17,002 --> 01:45:19,919
I will start chopping right away. Yeah.

01:45:19,919 --> 01:45:20,569

01:45:22,436 --> 01:45:24,269
OK. These are good.

This one's good to go.

01:47:32,482 --> 01:47:33,565
Oh, my God. This is like.

2892
01:47:33,565 --> 01:47:35,182
This is. Not. Sanitary.

2893
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:37,216
We're, like, violating
so many health codes right now.

2894
01:47:37,216 --> 01:47:37,582
No, no, no.

2895
01:47:37,582 --> 01:47:40,166
This is completely fine. This thing, it's
their fault for ordering so much shit.

2896
01:47:40,366 --> 01:47:41,716
We're this way. We're innocent.

2897
01:47:41,716 --> 01:47:43,283
Bystanders. OK.

Thank you. So, so sexy. You're gorgeous.

2902
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,867
You're so sexy. Look at you, cook.

2903
01:47:50,934 --> 01:47:54,117
Oh, all

2904
01:47:56,934 --> 01:47:59,218
I think I need to actually know
this is ready.

2905
01:47:59,218 --> 01:48:00,051
Is ready.

2906
01:48:01,368 --> 01:48:02,118
OK, that's good.

2907
01:48:02,118 --> 01:48:03,318
That's good.

01:48:04,935 --> 01:48:05,835
That's good.

2909
01:48:05,835 --> 01:48:07,135
I'm going to send this over.

2910
01:48:07,135 --> 01:48:09,202
There's an army pass. We're at three. 80.

2911
01:48:09,219 --> 01:48:10,686
We just need to not fail.

2912
01:48:10,686 --> 01:48:12,519
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

2913
01:48:13,586 --> 01:48:15,236
Make sure you got some meat
pasta coming, OK?

2914
01:48:15,236 --> 01:48:17,370
Yeah, that's me. Pasta.
Why didn't I see that?

2915
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:18,836
Yeah, there's a me pasta right there.

2916
01:48:18,836 --> 01:48:20,536
OK, we might fail one,
but I'll get another one then.

2917
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:22,220
That will give us a big enough tip.

2918
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,537
Yeah, that's belly anything.

2919
01:48:23,537 --> 01:48:24,287
That's fine. That's fine.

2920
01:48:24,287 --> 01:48:25,137
That's fine.

2921
01:48:25,137 --> 01:48:27,354
One more. For 17. That's enough.

2922
01:48:28,471 --> 01:48:29,071
No, I don't.

2923
01:48:29,071 --> 01:48:31,704
I can't get it. Oh, fuck.

2924
01:48:31,704 --> 01:48:32,821
No, no, it's fine.

2925
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:35,238
It's fine. Fine, fine, fine.
I don't worry. We got it.

2926
01:48:35,238 --> 01:48:36,088
No, we. Didn't.

2927
01:48:36,088 --> 01:48:36,688
Oh, it's in.

2928
01:48:36,688 --> 01:48:39,772
It's a harbour.

2929
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:42,205
Oh, my.

2930
01:48:42,205 --> 01:48:43,705
Oh, did you guys do you?

2931
01:48:43,705 --> 01:48:44,956
We were absolutely parking.

2932
01:48:44,956 --> 01:48:46,756
You were hogging so hard.

2933
01:48:46,756 --> 01:48:48,706
Shit. Oh.

2934
01:48:48,706 --> 01:48:50,273
Oh. OK.

2935
01:48:50,273 --> 01:48:53,240
One issue
I saw was that there's so much ingredients

2936
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,823
all over the place on myself,
so it was like, hard to pick some stuff.

2937
01:48:55,823 --> 01:48:57,507
So maybe not too many.

2938
01:48:57,507 --> 01:48:58,457
Yeah, not too many.

2939
01:48:58,457 --> 01:49:00,807
So, yeah, definitely. So, OK, ok.

2940
01:49:00,807 --> 01:49:02,941
And if we fix that, then I think we got it
this time.

2941
01:49:03,057 --> 01:49:06,108
I will literally, I will look at the
recipes and throw exactly what you need.

2942
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:08,341
OK, ok, we got it. We got it.

2943
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:10,375
OK, this one for sure, I believe.

2944
01:49:10,608 --> 01:49:11,125
Sure.

2945
01:49:11,125 --> 01:49:13,125
So much so I'm.

2946
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:14,775
Absolutely going to do it this time.

2947
01:49:17,875 --> 01:49:19,009
It's pasta.

2948
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:20,542
All right. Meat, pasta.

2949
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:22,776
Meat stuff.

2950
01:49:23,059 --> 01:49:23,959
All right.

2951
01:49:25,826 --> 01:49:29,327
This and this into the that's important
right now.

2952
01:49:29,543 --> 01:49:32,360
I'll cook that as well.

2953
01:49:33,377 --> 01:49:34,644
Pick it up shop, OK?

2954
01:49:34,644 --> 01:49:35,310
Yeah.

2955
01:49:36,077 --> 01:49:36,294
All right.

2956
01:49:36,294 --> 01:49:38,394
You've got
you should now have enough for everything.

2957
01:49:38,627 --> 01:49:39,161
Mm hmm.

2958
01:49:41,011 --> 01:49:42,561
I mean, do.

2959
01:49:49,045 --> 01:49:49,995
You know the customer?

2960
01:49:49,995 --> 01:49:51,862
OK, that's ready.

2961
01:49:51,862 --> 01:49:54,562
Our fish is ready.

2962
01:49:57,513 --> 01:50:00,013
It's it's it's

2963
01:50:00,413 --> 01:50:02,930
shrimp is ready.

2964
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:06,080
OK, this is ready.

2965
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,847
Done. Cook more shrimp.

2966
01:50:07,847 --> 01:50:09,797
I mean, you've seen me.

2967
01:50:09,797 --> 01:50:11,997
It's been a bit slow.

2968
01:50:11,997 --> 01:50:14,098
It's just the rotation of the thing.

2969
01:50:14,098 --> 01:50:15,114
There you go.

2970
01:50:15,448 --> 01:50:16,465
There you go.

2971
01:50:16,948 --> 01:50:17,898
There you go.

2972
01:50:18,948 --> 01:50:19,665
Oh, my God.

2973
01:50:19,665 --> 01:50:22,432
Oh, my God. Oh, my. God.

2974
01:50:22,548 --> 01:50:23,815
Oh, fuck.

01:50:32,066 --> 01:50:35,100
OK. Ow! Ow!

2977
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:37,133

2978
01:50:37,133 --> 01:50:38,917
Ow! No!

2979
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,817
And this is good to go.

2980
01:50:43,917 --> 01:50:45,501
It's sitting there. It's
just sitting there.

2981
01:50:45,501 --> 01:50:47,818
I got it. I got it. OK.

2982
01:50:47,818 --> 01:50:49,951
And then we got more.

2983
01:50:49,968 --> 01:50:52,135
We got more fucked. There's
no room for anything.

And then

2989
01:51:06,653 --> 01:51:07,486
hey, this is good.

2990
01:51:07,486 --> 01:51:08,453
Oh, shit.

You go.

2995
01:51:18,021 --> 01:51:19,187
Perfect. Perfect.

Oh, God. Holy shit.

01:52:30,544 --> 01:52:31,228
Oh, my God.

3028
01:52:31,228 --> 01:52:34,278
We haven't quite finished both of these
I kids get older.

3029
01:52:34,428 --> 01:52:35,178
Oh, my God.

3030
01:52:35,178 --> 01:52:36,678
Oh, my God.

3031
01:52:38,812 --> 01:52:40,945
624. Absolutely fine.

3032
01:52:40,945 --> 01:52:43,229
Pretty dude.

3033
01:52:43,229 --> 01:52:44,996
Absolutely. Paul My God.

3034
01:52:44,996 --> 01:52:47,363
Paul Holy shit.

3035
01:52:47,429 --> 01:52:48,796
Holy shit.

3036
01:52:48,796 --> 01:52:49,279
Look at us.

3037
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:50,330
Go look at us.

3038
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:53,330
Game The Onion, man.

3039
01:52:54,263 --> 01:52:56,063
Are you still happy?
Both of them were solid.

3040
01:52:56,063 --> 01:52:58,314
Was it to make our onion man
and his dog proud?

3041
01:52:59,430 --> 01:53:01,464
Godzilla.

3042
01:53:01,831 --> 01:53:03,631
Oh, that was so hard.

3043
01:53:03,631 --> 01:53:04,948
Oh, my.

3044
01:53:04,948 --> 01:53:07,165
Goodness. Christ,

3045
01:53:08,598 --> 01:53:11,065
oh, you know.

3046
01:53:13,048 --> 01:53:14,199
It really was just.

3047
01:53:14,199 --> 01:53:17,249
Like all about the organisation
there at that point.

3048
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:20,966
It helped Sheets and looked at Rainbow.

3049
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:23,216
Black, so that's to get it.

3050
01:53:23,216 --> 01:53:29,100
Then I think there's a secret who we we

3051
01:53:31,534 --> 01:53:33,667
you know there is a secret.

3052
01:53:33,667 --> 01:53:36,934
Oh no, we already touched that before,
haven't we just.

3053
01:53:36,984 --> 01:53:39,451
Jesse, Jesse are coming out.

3054
01:53:39,568 --> 01:53:41,468
You're making me
want to watch Breaking Bad now.

3055
01:53:41,468 --> 01:53:42,368
Is it good?

3056
01:53:42,718 --> 01:53:46,235
It's arguably one of the,
one of the best TV shows ever made.

3057
01:53:46,268 --> 01:53:49,435
Like I think it was like by far
the most popular show on in

3058
01:53:49,435 --> 01:53:51,969
the US like when it was coming out.

3059
01:53:52,586 --> 01:53:55,536
I was a kid when I came out, I think.

3060
01:53:55,536 --> 01:53:57,720
I don't, I don't think any show has,
like, better acting.

3061
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,336
It's really good.

3062
01:54:00,203 --> 01:54:02,137
Jesse, we needed to. Cook.

3063
01:54:03,087 --> 01:54:04,837
Or they cook all.

3064
01:54:04,837 --> 01:54:07,254
They cook that. OK? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3065
01:54:07,254 --> 01:54:09,554
I was like, wait. Or they actually.
They cook.

3066
01:54:09,554 --> 01:54:10,621
No, no. Yeah, they cook.

3067
01:54:10,621 --> 01:54:13,288
It's all about a. Fry cook business.
Wait, what?

3068
01:54:13,504 --> 01:54:14,138
How do.

3069
01:54:14,888 --> 01:54:18,122
We. You got a hold control.

3070
01:54:18,205 --> 01:54:18,638
Throw it out.

3071
01:54:18,638 --> 01:54:19,172
Wait.

3072
01:54:21,005 --> 01:54:21,872
Oh, it's got to.

3073
01:54:21,872 --> 01:54:23,822
Oh, you got to put it down. The what?

3074
01:54:23,822 --> 01:54:25,539
Wait, what is this?

3075
01:54:25,539 --> 01:54:26,822
What's this all?

3076
01:54:26,822 --> 01:54:28,406
I can't throw it because it's cooking.

3077
01:54:28,406 --> 01:54:29,973
Me. Oh, no, I can't throw it.

3078
01:54:29,973 --> 01:54:33,423
Oh, no, you can. I'm just dumb.

3079
01:54:33,423 --> 01:54:34,890
What the fuck? It's stupid.

3080
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:36,307
Yet? Wait.

3081
01:54:36,307 --> 01:54:37,173
Oh, my God. This is.

3082
01:54:37,173 --> 01:54:39,624
Yeah, it's not funny. Huh?

3083
01:54:45,474 --> 01:54:46,308
Like it's a mushroom.

3084
01:54:46,308 --> 01:54:48,475
OK, ok. OK, ok. Never mind.
Never mind, never mind.

3085
01:54:48,475 --> 01:54:50,558
I think I understand not a whole lot of.

3086
01:54:50,558 --> 01:54:52,325
Although not your fault, though.

3087
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:54,008
I think.

3088
01:54:54,008 --> 01:54:55,175
Any pasta over there.

3089
01:54:55,175 --> 01:54:57,459
Oh, now you get to of pasta, sir.

3090
01:54:57,459 --> 01:54:58,225
I want.

3091
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:02,076
Oh, my fucking.

3092
01:55:02,076 --> 01:55:04,826
Chops. Chop some stuff to get it. Topic
get you ready.

3093
01:55:04,826 --> 01:55:07,593
Yeah, that would be really handy.

3094
01:55:08,193 --> 01:55:09,660
Fuck me. Oh, my God.

3095
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,744
Oh, my God. Fuck me.

3096
01:55:12,744 --> 01:55:13,944
One. Where

3097
01:55:15,577 --> 01:55:17,727
right after this is done,
I'm going to need it for stress relief.

3098
01:55:17,727 --> 01:55:19,411
OK, bye.

3099
01:55:20,311 --> 01:55:22,628
Anymore pasta was or somewhere over there

3100
01:55:25,645 --> 01:55:26,162
I think.

3101
01:55:26,162 --> 01:55:27,662
Yeah, yeah. That's when you played it.

3102
01:55:27,662 --> 01:55:29,345
You just put it on the thingy

3103
01:55:29,345 --> 01:55:32,045
and send it over to me because you can't
throw the plates over eating, right?

3104
01:55:33,812 --> 01:55:35,879
We can certainly I call him now.

3105
01:55:35,879 --> 01:55:36,929
On over the mushroom.

3106
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:40,346
Mushroom twice here.

3107
01:55:42,096 --> 01:55:44,130
To me, pasta is ready.

3108
01:55:45,697 --> 01:55:46,380
Make another.

3109
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,064
I bend it. I'm a fucking dummy.

3110
01:55:48,064 --> 01:55:51,297
No. And literally been there. Oh.

3111
01:55:51,864 --> 01:55:54,964
I think every time I need more time
to figure that shit out.

3112
01:55:55,114 --> 01:55:56,014
Oh, my God.

3113
01:55:56,014 --> 01:55:58,231
Yeah, it's ok. It's OK. This is the.
This is the first round.

3114
01:55:58,231 --> 01:55:59,882
This is just the first round.
All everything on fire.

3115
01:55:59,882 --> 01:56:01,532
Me, the fire.

3116
01:56:01,532 --> 01:56:03,282
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

3117
01:56:03,282 --> 01:56:04,899
Where is the fire? Extinguisher.

3118
01:56:06,115 --> 01:56:07,016
Hello?

3119
01:56:07,749 --> 01:56:08,332
Oh, there it is.

3120
01:56:08,332 --> 01:56:11,699
Hidden with a mole. I got it.

3121
01:56:12,066 --> 01:56:14,933
Yeah, I.

3122
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:18,483
There goes all the food.

3123
01:56:18,483 --> 01:56:20,334
Is all the food fucked?

3124
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:21,750
Oh, no.

3125
01:56:25,784 --> 01:56:26,701
I was.

3126
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:27,518
I sent you a dish.

3127
01:56:27,518 --> 01:56:29,068
Oh, you did send me a dish. Sorry,
I didn't.

3128
01:56:29,068 --> 01:56:30,818
I died.

3129
01:56:30,818 --> 01:56:31,418
Oh, my God.

3130
01:56:31,418 --> 01:56:35,218
OK, this is another scuffed round
that's fine.

3131
01:56:35,218 --> 01:56:36,235
OK. All right.

3132
01:56:36,235 --> 01:56:38,485
I just got a shit throw.

3133
01:56:40,235 --> 01:56:41,552
OK, negative.

3134
01:56:41,552 --> 01:56:42,452
60. We are in.

3135
01:56:42,452 --> 01:56:45,353
We are negative. Down.

3136
01:56:45,353 --> 01:56:49,020
Like this is an episode of Kitchen
Nightmares.

3137
01:56:49,236 --> 01:56:50,553
You know, we're in Miami.

3138
01:56:51,037 --> 01:56:53,053
Now, OK? We're in -27 right now.

3139
01:56:53,053 --> 01:56:53,787
Good times seven.

3140
01:56:53,787 --> 01:56:54,420
Nice.

3141
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,754
Nice giving back.

3142
01:56:59,154 --> 01:57:01,138
Like, oh

3143
01:57:01,921 --> 01:57:04,021
I'm going to keep throwing stuff

3144
01:57:06,005 --> 01:57:06,455
yeah.

3145
01:57:06,455 --> 01:57:08,605
More pasta, more pasta,

3146
01:57:09,788 --> 01:57:10,988
more pasta.

3147
01:57:10,988 --> 01:57:13,089
All right, that's meat pasta done.

3148
01:57:14,189 --> 01:57:15,689
More pasta,

3149
01:57:16,256 --> 01:57:17,706
more pasta,

3150
01:57:18,323 --> 01:57:19,706
more pasta.

3151
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:20,706
Fucking stop.

3152
01:57:20,706 --> 01:57:24,540
Pasta stop or pasta stop.

3153
01:57:25,207 --> 01:57:27,757
More now more pasta.

3154
01:57:27,757 --> 01:57:30,390
There's too much more pasta.

3155
01:57:32,357 --> 01:57:33,391
I think more pasta.

3156
01:57:33,391 --> 01:57:37,058
They won't let me eat more pasta.

3157
01:57:38,725 --> 01:57:40,725
More I Yeah.

3158
01:57:40,741 --> 01:57:43,358
-50,000. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I got.

3159
01:57:43,408 --> 01:57:45,175
We got negative.

3160
01:57:45,175 --> 01:57:49,209
We got to sit this
and they look appropriately upset.

3161
01:57:49,676 --> 01:57:50,942
Holy shit.

3162
01:57:50,942 --> 01:57:54,093
Oh. Oh, what else?

3163
01:57:54,143 --> 01:57:57,576
We sit around from our pogroms round
last time

3164
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:00,727
yeah.

3165
01:58:00,727 --> 01:58:02,877
Negative points. That's crazy, dude.

3166
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,160
I like that.

3167
01:58:08,011 --> 01:58:10,911
Oh, my God. OK.

3168
01:58:10,911 --> 01:58:11,311
All right.

3169
01:58:11,311 --> 01:58:13,978
Try this again. Hmm. Hmm, hmm.

3170
01:58:13,978 --> 01:58:16,528
So this time it's all about.

3171
01:58:16,528 --> 01:58:17,812
Yeah, I will prepare.

3172
01:58:17,812 --> 01:58:20,845
I will just make the dish, and,
yeah, you chop it, throw it to me,

3173
01:58:20,845 --> 01:58:22,479
and then I'll put it down here
when it's done.

3174
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:22,929
You can.

3175
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:26,046
You can just get these in the

3176
01:58:26,046 --> 01:58:26,996
pots.

3177
01:58:27,396 --> 01:58:29,246
Right. Away, and I'll chop.

3178
01:58:29,246 --> 01:58:30,780
Actually, no,
we don't need meat right now.

3179
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:31,980
You need me to

3180
01:58:34,163 --> 01:58:35,697
mushrooms?

3181
01:58:35,697 --> 01:58:36,297
Yeah.

3182
01:58:37,864 --> 01:58:38,797
Here you go.

3183
01:58:38,797 --> 01:58:40,531
That's my mushroom.

3184
01:58:42,364 --> 01:58:42,597
This is.

3185
01:58:42,597 --> 01:58:44,614
I grabbed a meat pocket. Why not?

3186
01:58:46,164 --> 01:58:48,298
Here comes another mushroom, sir.

3187
01:58:48,298 --> 01:58:49,915
Excellent.

3188
01:58:49,915 --> 01:58:51,665
Love me a good love me.

3189
01:58:51,665 --> 01:58:53,165
Love me a sexy mushroom.

3190
01:58:53,165 --> 01:58:55,899
Yup. Here comes another meat.

3191
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:57,332
And you're going to need another mushroom.

3192
01:58:57,332 --> 01:58:59,582
That's all the ingredients
you need right now.

3193
01:58:59,766 --> 01:59:01,799
Besides the pasta, I'll send you,
I'm sure.

3194
01:59:01,799 --> 01:59:03,099
Pasta right now.

3195
01:59:03,099 --> 01:59:04,416
Here we go. Oh, shit.

3196
01:59:04,416 --> 01:59:05,516
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3197
01:59:05,516 --> 01:59:08,183
Fuck will happen.

3198
01:59:08,183 --> 01:59:08,467
Sorry.

3199
01:59:08,467 --> 01:59:10,800
I tried to put it on the thing
to plate it, and I missed it.

3200
01:59:11,317 --> 01:59:12,017
Panicked

3201
01:59:14,584 --> 01:59:15,667
man. Let me just.

3202
01:59:15,667 --> 01:59:16,784
Do my

3203
01:59:20,034 --> 01:59:23,918
shit for you.

3204
01:59:25,868 --> 01:59:27,635
Are you feeling it now, Mr. Crabs?

3205
01:59:27,635 --> 01:59:28,819
Are you feeling. Absolutely.

3206
01:59:28,819 --> 01:59:31,019
You feel that
this is for you to dish points.

3207
01:59:31,019 --> 01:59:32,452
You dishes. Or watch out. That's burning

3208
01:59:34,536 --> 01:59:34,836
nice.

3209
01:59:34,836 --> 01:59:35,819
Good job. Good job. Which up?

3210
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:37,586
Your job, your parking,
your body and your soul partners.

3211
01:59:37,586 --> 01:59:39,753
Your soul partners.
One more. One more. Coming over now.

3212
01:59:40,053 --> 01:59:40,753
Three to four.

3213
01:59:40,753 --> 01:59:42,770
Oh, my God.
You got the dishes for your trouble.

3214
01:59:42,787 --> 01:59:43,537
Three for me.

3215
01:59:43,537 --> 01:59:45,004
Holy shit. God.

3216
01:59:45,004 --> 01:59:47,187
Three, three, and one. Go. Delicious.

3217
01:59:47,187 --> 01:59:48,987
Nice. That's one.

3218
01:59:49,654 --> 01:59:50,904
That's two.

3219
01:59:50,904 --> 01:59:53,188
I could also do with

3220
01:59:53,188 --> 01:59:55,988
another one of you in the shop.

3221
01:59:55,988 --> 01:59:57,055
Another mushroom.

3222
01:59:57,055 --> 02:00:00,388
Make sure to also when you do the plates,
put them back on the thing. Hmm?

3223
02:00:00,938 --> 02:00:04,989
Yeah, the plates just came back,
so you'll get them on the next run.

3224
02:00:05,406 --> 02:00:06,122
Yep. Yep.

3225
02:00:06,122 --> 02:00:06,622
That's fine.

3226
02:00:06,622 --> 02:00:07,472
That's fine.

3227
02:00:11,256 --> 02:00:13,523
OK, all right.

3228
02:00:13,523 --> 02:00:14,156
I have to go.

3229
02:00:14,156 --> 02:00:16,657
And do the dishes
and then put them put back.

3230
02:00:16,707 --> 02:00:18,323
I have to put it back.

3231
02:00:18,323 --> 02:00:20,607
I can't throw the plates.
You have to put it back on the thing

3232
02:00:24,357 --> 02:00:25,624
we aren't doing much about this thing.

3233
02:00:25,624 --> 02:00:26,758
OK, ok. OK.

3234
02:00:26,758 --> 02:00:29,158
You got plates back. You got plates.
Are you plates already? Plates already.

3235
02:00:29,675 --> 02:00:31,708
This one's more pasta.

3236
02:00:33,875 --> 02:00:34,675
There we go.

3237
02:00:34,675 --> 02:00:35,975
There you go.

3238
02:00:37,542 --> 02:00:39,559
Also, thank you for all the gifts.

3239
02:00:40,526 --> 02:00:42,476
OK, there's more pasta.

3240
02:00:42,476 --> 02:00:43,743
You need put.

3241
02:00:44,043 --> 02:00:46,526
On. Hold on, hold on.

3242
02:00:46,526 --> 02:00:48,576
All uh.

3243
02:00:48,576 --> 02:00:49,527
Shit,

3244
02:00:50,343 --> 02:00:51,443
shit, shit, shit.

3245
02:00:51,443 --> 02:00:52,110
Shit, shit.

3246
02:00:53,094 --> 02:00:56,044
Oh, I don't think
we're getting a mushroom one

3247
02:00:58,627 --> 02:01:00,528
I was about to run out.

3248
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:02,044
Fuck you.

3249
02:01:02,044 --> 02:01:04,678
All right, now we go as one.

3250
02:01:07,795 --> 02:01:09,062
Some meats.

3251
02:01:09,062 --> 02:01:11,495
Plate. Play it up.

3252
02:01:11,495 --> 02:01:12,879
Meat going on,

3253
02:01:13,529 --> 02:01:14,662
pasta

3254
02:01:17,046 --> 02:01:18,113
that's done.

3255
02:01:19,196 --> 02:01:19,596
Fuck.

3256
02:01:19,596 --> 02:01:21,596
Play, play, play, play, play, play plate.

3257
02:01:21,596 --> 02:01:22,296
Yeah. Plates are good.

3258
02:01:22,296 --> 02:01:23,430
Plates are ready.

3259
02:01:24,997 --> 02:01:25,597
Oh, shit.

3260
02:01:25,597 --> 02:01:27,064
Looks so stressful over on that side.

3261
02:01:27,064 --> 02:01:30,481
The kitchen is

3262
02:01:31,414 --> 02:01:31,681
all right.

3263
02:01:31,681 --> 02:01:34,131
Your hands are, like,
getting and getting crap. Shit.

3264
02:01:34,648 --> 02:01:35,164
Oh, no.

3265
02:01:39,065 --> 02:01:41,465
Mushroom pasta done.

3266
02:01:44,365 --> 02:01:44,915
Meat pasta.

3267
02:01:44,915 --> 02:01:45,249
Done.

3268
02:01:45,249 --> 02:01:46,565
I'm chilling.

3269
02:01:49,982 --> 02:01:51,983
Oh, my God.

3270
02:01:51,983 --> 02:01:54,683
That the I took a glance over what.

3271
02:01:54,683 --> 02:01:56,966
You had to do off is just, like,
so chaotic.

3272
02:01:58,283 --> 02:02:00,083
Mike, this game is like this

3273
02:02:00,083 --> 02:02:03,450
game is like a long

3274
02:02:04,051 --> 02:02:08,251
just series of events where one player
has to do everything in the other place.

3275
02:02:08,251 --> 02:02:11,618
Yeah, because last round,
it was me, like, suffering on the other.

3276
02:02:11,618 --> 02:02:12,385
Yeah, it was.

3277
02:02:12,385 --> 02:02:13,801
And now it's now.

3278
02:02:13,801 --> 02:02:15,985
It's now the customer has come around.

3279
02:02:16,385 --> 02:02:17,102
Yeah.

3280
02:02:17,168 --> 02:02:19,319
I mean, this is all.

3281
02:02:19,769 --> 02:02:22,469
I mean, this is, you know,
it's like we start teaching.

3282
02:02:22,469 --> 02:02:26,003
I saw what's exactly
the stress of the kitchen.

3283
02:02:26,736 --> 02:02:27,653
When we're getting.

3284
02:02:27,653 --> 02:02:29,520
Lubricated and caffeinated.

3285
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,986
We're at we're actually.

3286
02:02:30,986 --> 02:02:35,854
Yeah, we are actually getting getting
looped up and ready for what comes next.

3287
02:02:37,837 --> 02:02:38,904
Thank you, sir.

3288
02:02:38,904 --> 02:02:40,137
Here's your mushroom.

3289
02:02:40,137 --> 02:02:41,904
I'm on top of it this time.

3290
02:02:41,904 --> 02:02:44,404
Here's something we have some meats here.

3291
02:02:44,404 --> 02:02:44,755
Well, I'm

3292
02:02:44,755 --> 02:02:46,988
glad that you can enjoy the fantasy
of being on top of something for once.

3293
02:02:47,788 --> 02:02:49,922
What the fuck? But.

3294
02:02:49,922 --> 02:02:51,989
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine. It's
fine. Keep walking. Come on.

3295
02:02:51,989 --> 02:02:54,689
Come on, now. We're in the kitchen
now. Tell me, what was that?

3296
02:02:54,705 --> 02:02:55,806
Was that comments?

3297
02:02:55,806 --> 02:02:58,222
Was that kind of not important?

3298
02:02:58,256 --> 02:03:00,873
Not relevant to the kitchen? Come on.

3299
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:01,256
You're lucky.

3300
02:03:01,256 --> 02:03:03,840
I'm. I'm stranded on this side
of the side of the kitchen.

3301
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,973
I was. I'll come. Over for you
over there on my.

3302
02:03:05,973 --> 02:03:08,123
Bed. You over on the counter
opened you over in the counter.

3303
02:03:08,273 --> 02:03:10,257
Oh, I'd like to see you fucking try.

3304
02:03:10,257 --> 02:03:12,007
I'd like to see you
fucking try. I'll put you in the ground.

3305
02:03:12,957 --> 02:03:13,857
Very literally.

3306
02:03:13,857 --> 02:03:16,108
Quite 1000 feet above the ground.

3307
02:03:16,108 --> 02:03:17,908
I don't think so.

3308
02:03:17,908 --> 02:03:20,108
I don't think that's happening
any time soon. Sorry.

3309
02:03:20,108 --> 02:03:20,975
That's not going to happen.

3310
02:03:20,975 --> 02:03:23,075
That's how I. Look at that.

3311
02:03:24,175 --> 02:03:25,325
Oh, good job.

3312
02:03:25,325 --> 02:03:25,892
Hold on.

3313
02:03:25,892 --> 02:03:27,275
Thank you.

3314
02:03:30,126 --> 02:03:31,709
Send more pasta over.

3315
02:03:31,709 --> 02:03:32,793
There you go.

3316
02:03:33,126 --> 02:03:34,743
Is your noodles

3317
02:03:38,076 --> 02:03:38,343
guys?

3318
02:03:38,343 --> 02:03:41,677
Trust me, one of these days on blocks
is going to be the one barking for me.

3319
02:03:42,277 --> 02:03:43,227
It'll. It'll get there.

3320
02:03:43,227 --> 02:03:45,444
We'll get there.
Keep dreaming going. Keep dreaming.

3321
02:03:45,444 --> 02:03:48,027
I don't have to dream on the bigger
reality.

3322
02:03:48,627 --> 02:03:49,894
All right, prove it.

3323
02:03:50,344 --> 02:03:50,644
All right.

3324
02:03:50,644 --> 02:03:53,045
I will give it, like.

3325
02:03:53,045 --> 02:03:53,845
Even a couple more.

3326
02:03:53,845 --> 02:03:55,145
I like. I like.

3327
02:03:55,145 --> 02:03:56,845
I like this one. Can you, boy,
I like this one.

3328
02:03:56,845 --> 02:03:58,562
Can you keep that going?

3329
02:03:58,562 --> 02:04:00,279
And we'll see
and we'll see what we'll see what happens.

3330
02:04:00,279 --> 02:04:01,712
All right. Remember
to wash your fucking dishes. Yeah.

3331
02:04:01,712 --> 02:04:03,512
I'm watching you right
now. I'm watching right now.

3332
02:04:03,512 --> 02:04:05,996
I could get at least one box here.

3333
02:04:05,996 --> 02:04:08,346
Yeah, I could get one back
to you before it flies back.

3334
02:04:10,946 --> 02:04:17,914
You shit, man.

3335
02:04:17,964 --> 02:04:19,614
Do you need more pasta?

3336
02:04:19,614 --> 02:04:21,747
Uh, yes, please. OK.

3337
02:04:23,948 --> 02:04:24,998
All right. I'm going to shop more.

3338
02:04:24,998 --> 02:04:27,215
We go mushroom passed it on.

3339
02:04:27,348 --> 02:04:28,165
Let's do, like.

3340
02:04:29,165 --> 02:04:30,632
We'll plate these.

3341
02:04:30,632 --> 02:04:34,065

3343
02:04:37,899 --> 02:04:39,316
We go.

3344
02:04:40,683 --> 02:04:42,183
OK. Three plates.

3345
02:04:42,183 --> 02:04:45,233
Three plates are coming for you right now
at the ready.

3346
02:04:45,833 --> 02:04:46,983
Excellent.

3347
02:04:47,016 --> 02:04:47,967
Good boy.

3348
02:04:50,067 --> 02:04:51,034
Here you go.

3349
02:04:51,034 --> 02:04:55,467
And here you go.

3350
02:04:56,284 --> 02:04:58,768
And here you go.

Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

3353
02:05:03,385 --> 02:05:05,468
We got one minute left, by the way.

3354
02:05:05,468 --> 02:05:06,418
Oh, my fucking God.

3355
02:05:06,418 --> 02:05:08,635
My left, one mil left.

3356
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:11,919
POG, pog, pog

I mean, chef. Yes,
Chef. Sorry, Chef. Don't.

3360
02:05:20,953 --> 02:05:23,037
Don't worry, chef. Please
don't fuck me, Chef.

3361
02:05:23,037 --> 02:05:23,870
I'm sorry, Chef.

3362
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:26,220
I'm sorry, chef.
Whatever you want. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

3363
02:05:26,637 --> 02:05:28,887
I like that you told us what you want.

3364
02:05:28,887 --> 02:05:31,804
Oh, we lost points. Damn it.

3365
02:05:34,088 --> 02:05:37,088
Oh. That's fine.

3366
02:05:37,088 --> 02:05:38,288
I fucking binge.

3367
02:05:38,288 --> 02:05:40,205
I'm dumb twice.

3368
02:05:40,205 --> 02:05:41,605
I'm a dumb fuck.

3369
02:05:41,605 --> 02:05:43,705
All your ads on all your ads on voice.

3370
02:05:43,739 --> 02:05:45,422
I was. Rushing off.

3371
02:05:45,422 --> 02:05:46,622
I was rushing out.

3372
02:05:46,622 --> 02:05:48,723
Don't let it get. To the convoy.

3373
02:05:48,723 --> 02:05:51,773
Don't let it get to your fucking head
all the. Way

3374
02:05:53,256 --> 02:05:55,990
through the order down the bin
right there.

3375
02:05:56,007 --> 02:05:57,307
Yeah, I think we made it all.

3376
02:05:57,307 --> 02:06:00,307
Do we made it or do we have to get 480?

3377
02:06:00,357 --> 02:06:01,357
Please, please.

3378
02:06:01,357 --> 02:06:02,407
It's costing. Things.

3379
02:06:02,407 --> 02:06:04,807
But yeah, we did. Yeah.

3380
02:06:04,807 --> 02:06:06,658
Let's go, all of you.

3381
02:06:06,658 --> 02:06:08,975
That's your vessel -30. Shit.

3382
02:06:09,508 --> 02:06:10,708
Yeah, we did see it.

3383
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:13,208
It just barely just barely.

3384
02:06:13,675 --> 02:06:15,008
Fuck yeah.

3385
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:17,809
Hey. Yeah,

3386
02:06:18,759 --> 02:06:20,576
you know, for a while
you did really well there.

3387
02:06:20,576 --> 02:06:21,426
They really well back there.

3388
02:06:21,426 --> 02:06:22,142
You'll do a sexy.

3389
02:06:22,142 --> 02:06:24,526
Yes, I bet your arse was really out
too little.

3390
02:06:24,526 --> 02:06:26,093
It's not. Very much.

3391
02:06:26,093 --> 02:06:29,010
The way you handle those mushrooms,
the way you toss it up, will you?

3392
02:06:29,010 --> 02:06:31,377
Caressed that meat while you plated it.

3393
02:06:31,627 --> 02:06:33,994
Beautiful plating, beautiful technique.

3394
02:06:33,994 --> 02:06:36,211
So you're saying I'm
not a stupid little boy then?

3395
02:06:36,211 --> 02:06:37,894
I mean, you're still stupid
little boy by me.

3396
02:06:37,894 --> 02:06:40,044
That doesn't mean
I can't compliment you on your clothes.

3397
02:06:40,144 --> 02:06:43,645
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. All right, all right.

3398
02:06:45,211 --> 02:06:47,278
OK, here we go. Now.

3399
02:06:47,278 --> 02:06:50,595
I don't actually know all we can do. We

3400
02:06:50,595 --> 02:06:52,679
like this place.

3401
02:06:53,996 --> 02:06:55,162
What the fuck are we?

3402
02:06:55,162 --> 02:06:57,963
Look.
What is that? The catch up dimension.

3403
02:06:58,863 --> 02:06:59,613
The catch up.

3404
02:06:59,613 --> 02:07:03,180
Woven the dwarven mineshaft burritos.

3405
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:05,813
We got to make burritos. Wow.

3406
02:07:06,147 --> 02:07:09,680
Get some of that chocolate
and salt or that.

3407
02:07:09,697 --> 02:07:13,147
Make it take a tortilla, add cooked rice,
then add fried chicken.

3408
02:07:13,147 --> 02:07:15,314
Meat or mushroom or.

3409
02:07:17,015 --> 02:07:18,448
Everything looks cool down the earth.

3410
02:07:18,448 --> 02:07:21,098
Oh. Hey.

3411
02:07:21,098 --> 02:07:23,432
What the fuck do I boil.

3412
02:07:26,849 --> 02:07:27,449
Rice over here?

3413
02:07:27,449 --> 02:07:29,482
Let me. Let me see you. The rice.

3414
02:07:29,732 --> 02:07:30,449
OK, ok.

3415
02:07:30,449 --> 02:07:32,366
Yeah, yeah.
You got to ask me. It's awesome rice here.

3416
02:07:32,366 --> 02:07:33,449
I think you've got to go.

3417
02:07:33,449 --> 02:07:34,950
I'll toss you off.

3418
02:07:35,083 --> 02:07:38,283
Oh. Well, I mean,

3419
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:39,000
I'm in front of them.

3420
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,834
In front of all these people.

3421
02:07:40,834 --> 02:07:42,234
You just be one

3422
02:07:43,267 --> 02:07:46,017
God. Always so embarrassing.

3423
02:07:46,684 --> 02:07:51,151
You guys do this OK?

3424
02:07:51,385 --> 02:07:53,435
So what are you doing?

3425
02:07:53,435 --> 02:07:55,318
Step bro. Gaming.

3426
02:07:55,318 --> 02:07:56,485
What are you doing?

3427
02:07:56,485 --> 02:07:58,269
You do it down the hallway.

3428
02:07:58,269 --> 02:08:00,669
Purely fucking gaming.

3429
02:08:01,136 --> 02:08:01,569
I need.

3430
02:08:01,569 --> 02:08:03,802
I need the cooked mushroom
and the cooked meats.

3431
02:08:03,836 --> 02:08:05,703
Oh, this is I.
This is a dud. I fucked it up.

3432
02:08:05,703 --> 02:08:07,553
What do you need?

3433
02:08:07,553 --> 02:08:10,470
You need another mushroom, sir.

3434
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:12,237
Possibly, sir.

3435
02:08:12,237 --> 02:08:13,253
I'm Musharraf.

3436
02:08:13,253 --> 02:08:15,837
Chef. Chef, owner, please.

3437
02:08:16,404 --> 02:08:18,237
Oh. No, no. It's not a problem.

3438
02:08:18,237 --> 02:08:21,087
Is problem with me.
Not a problem with me or look for me.

3439
02:08:21,087 --> 02:08:23,254
Is there anything you'd like? One.

3440
02:08:23,254 --> 02:08:24,604
Just. Just throw the meat on.

3441
02:08:24,604 --> 02:08:25,805
You can get those.

3442
02:08:25,988 --> 02:08:28,238
I'll send it over. Here you go.

3443
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:29,555
OK. OK, ok, ok. OK.

3444
02:08:29,555 --> 02:08:32,155
Now, now that we've explored this a bit,
we can establish the roles.

3445
02:08:32,589 --> 02:08:33,489
Oh, time is not going.

3446
02:08:33,489 --> 02:08:35,256
That was it. Time right now.

3447
02:08:35,256 --> 02:08:37,222
Because I guess this is oil.
It's teaching us how to do it.

3448
02:08:38,422 --> 02:08:39,123
And now all.

3449
02:08:39,123 --> 02:08:40,139
We do first, as.

3450
02:08:40,139 --> 02:08:42,323
Soon as the first order goes out, it
starts.

3451
02:08:42,706 --> 02:08:45,206
OK, ok. OK, that makes sense.

3452
02:08:45,206 --> 02:08:46,290
That makes sense.

3453
02:08:47,307 --> 02:08:50,124
There is a gift sub
war happening in my shop right now.

3454
02:08:50,374 --> 02:08:51,807
Who's going the crazy?

3455
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,524
I wish I. Did well then.

3456
02:08:53,524 --> 02:08:57,874
I wish I could say thank you, but
we are panicked and to actively gaming.

3457
02:08:57,874 --> 02:09:00,841
I mean, if you want, take a break
to go and address that chill for you, ok?

3458
02:09:00,925 --> 02:09:02,608
You sturdy plates.

3459
02:09:04,592 --> 02:09:07,109
Eight plates from a dirty boy.

3460
02:09:07,159 --> 02:09:09,609
I'll have you know I shower.

3461
02:09:09,609 --> 02:09:11,376
Every every evening.

3462
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:13,526
I'm a are you a night shower
or a morning shower?

3463
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:15,143
I'm a morning shower myself.

3464
02:09:15,143 --> 02:09:15,443
That was.

3465
02:09:15,443 --> 02:09:17,693
Really.
You got a bad one. It's all smelly.

3466
02:09:18,476 --> 02:09:20,377
Sometimes I'll do
only two in the day, to be honest.

3467
02:09:21,577 --> 02:09:22,827
I like I like an evening shower.

3468
02:09:22,827 --> 02:09:25,044
Evening shower is a nice

3469
02:09:25,644 --> 02:09:27,894
but there are luxury, you know,
you're not busy.

3470
02:09:27,894 --> 02:09:29,244
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

3471
02:09:29,244 --> 02:09:31,344
I need rice, by the way.
I haven't gotten any rice.

3472
02:09:31,494 --> 02:09:32,228
Oh, shit.

3473
02:09:32,228 --> 02:09:32,861
I look

3474
02:09:35,311 --> 02:09:38,312

3475
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:39,095
Rice,

3476
02:09:39,812 --> 02:09:41,245
fog, rice.

3477
02:09:41,579 --> 02:09:46,596
OK, also, here you go.

3478
02:09:47,579 --> 02:09:48,713
Like you.

3479
02:09:50,163 --> 02:09:52,196
Throw plate on the floor.

3480
02:09:52,196 --> 02:09:53,347
When you.

3481
02:09:53,513 --> 02:09:56,013
Rice is going in. Rice is going in.

3482
02:09:56,013 --> 02:09:58,164
That was the mushroom burrito.

3483
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:02,781
OK, I'm sending this out
and I need more rice and believe

3484
02:10:03,781 --> 02:10:04,298
more rice.

3485
02:10:04,298 --> 02:10:05,198
Gotcha.

3486
02:10:07,148 --> 02:10:08,198
Thank you.

3487
02:10:08,198 --> 02:10:09,698
You know, it's ready.

3488
02:10:15,199 --> 02:10:16,265
We got a plate, but.

3489
02:10:16,265 --> 02:10:19,616
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3490

Rice throwing and talking to myself.

3495
02:10:35,651 --> 02:10:38,151
Medium dog

3496
02:10:39,934 --> 02:10:40,268
oh, god.

3497
02:10:40,268 --> 02:10:42,235
Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up, cook faster.

3498
02:10:42,235 --> 02:10:43,435
Rice, please.

3499
02:10:43,435 --> 02:10:45,968
Let me, let me do the dishes.

3500
02:10:47,769 --> 02:10:49,802
Oh, just in time.

3501
02:10:55,536 --> 02:10:57,953
Carry some rice.

3502
02:10:57,953 --> 02:10:59,453
I'll grab this

3503
02:11:01,437 --> 02:11:02,220
here. Drop it.

3504
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:03,303
Thank you.

3505
02:11:04,203 --> 02:11:05,637
And I'll put that up.

3506
02:11:05,637 --> 02:11:06,604
And I need more rice.

3507
02:11:06,604 --> 02:11:07,987
Any more rice is up.

3508
02:11:07,987 --> 02:11:08,821
It's up

3509
02:11:11,304 --> 02:11:13,554
thank you for

3510
02:11:13,554 --> 02:11:14,338
family.

3511
02:11:14,338 --> 02:11:15,488
Dude, I didn't expect to throw it.

3512
02:11:15,488 --> 02:11:17,521
I got fumbled.

3513
02:11:17,788 --> 02:11:21,572
Should you give me some mushrooms?

3514
02:11:22,472 --> 02:11:24,089
Yeah, actually, we got rush.

3515
02:11:24,089 --> 02:11:27,022
Yeah,

3516
02:11:29,573 --> 02:11:30,056
Yeah, i got it.

3517
02:11:30,056 --> 02:11:32,523
I got. We need meat now. The other meat's
cooked. The meat cooked. Right?

3518
02:11:33,023 --> 02:11:34,473
That was that was my bad.
I didn't mean that.

3519
02:11:34,473 --> 02:11:36,673
It's done. It's
done. It's done. It's done. Think

3520
02:11:38,023 --> 02:11:39,074
shit.

3521
02:11:39,457 --> 02:11:40,057
You got

3522
02:11:43,057 --> 02:11:43,924
this one's not that bad.

3523
02:11:43,924 --> 02:11:45,624
Actually,
we just got to get a rhythm going.

3524
02:11:45,624 --> 02:11:46,441
Yeah, we just got it.

3525
02:11:46,441 --> 02:11:48,508
We just got to figure out
what each person is doing.

3526
02:11:48,508 --> 02:11:51,208
What OK.

3527
02:11:51,608 --> 02:11:52,708
Let's. We might even get a first. Right.

3528
02:11:52,708 --> 02:11:54,875
It's only six points to get through. Okay.

3529
02:11:54,925 --> 02:11:57,025
Any more rice? Any more rice ASAP?

3530
02:11:57,025 --> 02:11:57,875
One second.

3531
02:12:04,643 --> 02:12:05,793
Oh, wait.

3532
02:12:05,793 --> 02:12:08,493
Is this not cooked? It's not cooked.

3533
02:12:08,493 --> 02:12:10,627
Oh, shit. Really? Hold on.

3534
02:12:10,627 --> 02:12:12,627
I'll grab this one of those ones cocked.

3535
02:12:12,627 --> 02:12:13,344
OK, I think we can get.

3536
02:12:13,344 --> 02:12:14,094
I think we can do it.

3537
02:12:14,094 --> 02:12:15,960
I think we could do it.

3538
02:12:18,227 --> 02:12:18,661
OK, now

3539
02:12:18,661 --> 02:12:21,578
I just need one more off
fuck and one more rice can do our time.

3540
02:12:21,778 --> 02:12:22,744
Our time

3541
02:12:23,528 --> 02:12:24,395
to coordinate this.

3542
02:12:24,395 --> 02:12:26,128
We coordinate the small.

3543
02:12:26,128 --> 02:12:27,678
Possibly it is lights.

3544
02:12:28,895 --> 02:12:30,429
Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom on.

3545
02:12:30,429 --> 02:12:32,029
Mushroom on. OK.

3546
02:12:32,029 --> 02:12:33,312
A mushroom.

3547
02:12:34,329 --> 02:12:36,296
I I di.

3548
02:12:36,412 --> 02:12:37,163
I don't think so.

3549
02:12:37,163 --> 02:12:37,913
I don't think so.

3550
02:12:37,913 --> 02:12:40,613
Rice wasn't so fucking close.

3551
02:12:40,613 --> 02:12:43,346
Oh, man. I would have been so close.

3552
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:45,413
Actually,
we just fucked up two orders. Oh, my God.

3553
02:12:45,413 --> 02:12:46,413
We did so well done.

3554
02:12:46,413 --> 02:12:49,880
Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

3555
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,414
It's rock n roll.

3556
02:12:52,414 --> 02:12:53,848
Look at eights.

3557
02:12:54,064 --> 02:12:58,898
Look, look, look, look.

3558
02:12:59,881 --> 02:13:02,315
What I love. This is in the pan.

3559
02:13:02,315 --> 02:13:03,548
Look at Ed's.

3560
02:13:03,548 --> 02:13:06,332
Look, look, look.

3561
02:13:06,332 --> 02:13:06,665
Love.

3562
02:13:06,665 --> 02:13:08,349
His voice cracks.

3563
02:13:09,366 --> 02:13:10,816
My favourite, my favourite one.

3564
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:11,316
My favourite one.

3565
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:14,700
Is you cook it in a burnt pan,
you fuck dick,

3566
02:13:15,716 --> 02:13:18,300
you fucking. Dig

3567
02:13:19,133 --> 02:13:21,000
oh. And you just.

3568
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,284
Oh, a slice of mouldy tomato.

3569
02:13:23,284 --> 02:13:25,284
He said that before he did.

3570
02:13:25,284 --> 02:13:26,884
And, like,
it's like in the second episode.

3571
02:13:26,884 --> 02:13:29,184
Have you ever seen that one? It's like the
what's it called?

3572
02:13:29,618 --> 02:13:31,885
It's Dillon's
the Indian restaurant in New York,

3573
02:13:32,318 --> 02:13:34,652
and it's where, like,
there are flies in the thing,

3574
02:13:34,652 --> 02:13:36,652
and there's that weird, creepy manager
and everything.

3575
02:13:36,652 --> 02:13:38,885
It's like, that was
that was a classic episode. Those little.

3576
02:13:39,485 --> 02:13:42,269
Huh. OK, rice pizza, rice.

3577
02:13:42,269 --> 02:13:43,919
Right, right. Yeah. On a plate.

3578
02:13:43,919 --> 02:13:44,636
And you put the 30.

3579
02:13:44,636 --> 02:13:46,919
Just throw a few things the rice over to
you so you'd have to worry.

3580
02:13:46,953 --> 02:13:48,853
Yeah, I'd be really healthy.

3581
02:13:48,853 --> 02:13:51,253
Three or so to start their orders.

3582
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:52,770
Here's your mushrooms.

3583
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:54,503
Thank you. It's your veggies.

3584
02:13:54,503 --> 02:13:56,337
Eat your veggies, your fungus.

3585
02:13:56,337 --> 02:13:57,720
Whatever you veg.

3586
02:14:01,004 --> 02:14:02,338
OK, OK.

3587
02:14:02,338 --> 02:14:04,454
Now I'm just waiting on the mushroom
and meet.

3588
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:07,921
These two are ready. Are here already OK?

3589
02:14:07,938 --> 02:14:09,838
What's he doing there? Yeah, that's right.
He played up.

3590
02:14:09,838 --> 02:14:11,188
Yeah, played it up.

3591
02:14:11,188 --> 02:14:13,605
And then this is ready. To all go.

3592
02:14:13,805 --> 02:14:14,955
Y'all look at us.

3593
02:14:14,955 --> 02:14:19,173
Y'all look at that synergy
give me more rice and more rice.

3594
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:20,423
More, more, more. More, more.

3595
02:14:20,423 --> 02:14:21,023
Here we go.

3596
02:14:21,023 --> 02:14:21,923
There we go.

3597
02:14:24,173 --> 02:14:25,173
Look at us. Go.

3598
02:14:25,173 --> 02:14:25,857
Look up. Go.

3599
02:14:25,857 --> 02:14:28,723
Holy shit.
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'll meet you.

3600
02:14:28,807 --> 02:14:30,324
I'll put the dirty, dirty plates out here.

3601
02:14:30,324 --> 02:14:31,890
I'm good. Grab your meat.

3602
02:14:32,307 --> 02:14:33,024
I grab my meat.

3603
02:14:33,024 --> 02:14:35,724
Grab me while I'm grabbing your meat.

3604
02:14:35,724 --> 02:14:37,058
I'm squeezing it.

3605
02:14:37,058 --> 02:14:38,791
Saying out to the customers.

3606
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:41,758
Go mushroom.

3607
02:14:47,409 --> 02:14:49,376
Go. That is cooking.

3608
02:14:49,376 --> 02:14:52,042
And OK, here we go.

3609
02:14:52,926 --> 02:14:53,343
Let's

3610
02:14:54,393 --> 02:14:57,510
go and

3611
02:14:57,876 --> 02:15:01,477
the whole meat thing. OK?

3612
02:15:02,277 --> 02:15:04,110
Oh, where's the where's the frying pan?

3613
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:05,194
Can you bring the frying pan back, please?

3614
02:15:05,194 --> 02:15:08,077
Oh, yeah, yeah. Frying pan frying pan.

3615
02:15:08,644 --> 02:15:09,594
Here you go.

3616
02:15:10,861 --> 02:15:12,778
I'll leave out there.

3617
02:15:12,778 --> 02:15:13,961
I'll just grab rice warm here.

3618
02:15:13,961 --> 02:15:14,728
Fuck it.

3619
02:15:17,528 --> 02:15:18,728
Yeah, I'll there.

3620
02:15:18,728 --> 02:15:20,879
I get. The new that we have here.

3621
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:23,696
We're destroying this one.

3622
02:15:24,962 --> 02:15:26,646
Grab the rice, grab the racial,

3623
02:15:26,646 --> 02:15:28,863
grab the rice off

3624
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:33,847
and go send another this
and another mushroom over to your side.

3625
02:15:33,847 --> 02:15:34,897
I think you might need that.

3626
02:15:34,897 --> 02:15:35,213
Cute.

3627
02:15:35,213 --> 02:15:38,097
Q OK, here's more dirty dishes.

3628
02:15:38,097 --> 02:15:40,514
Oh, she just died. Oh, my.
I had my edition.

3629
02:15:40,897 --> 02:15:44,914
I can't put my finger down on the fucking
up arrow, and I'm using wires instead.

3630
02:15:46,231 --> 02:15:49,415
Wires wise

3631
02:15:49,415 --> 02:15:50,548
this one's good skill.

3632
02:15:50,548 --> 02:15:52,532
Nice. So I'm using your one.

3633
02:15:55,382 --> 02:15:58,449
Shut your mouth, shut your fucking.

3634
02:15:59,016 --> 02:15:59,499
Shut your mouth.

3635
02:15:59,499 --> 02:16:00,382
Remember.

3636
02:16:01,866 --> 02:16:03,966
There's so much sexual tension
whenever we collide.

3637
02:16:03,966 --> 02:16:06,366
Why is this?
Why is that the case? I don't. Know.

3638
02:16:06,666 --> 02:16:07,383
I couldn't tell.

3639
02:16:07,383 --> 02:16:08,250
I'm not complaining, though.

3640
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:10,383
I put. Yeah, no, I mean me.

3641
02:16:10,383 --> 02:16:12,784
I just come so naturally.

3642
02:16:12,784 --> 02:16:15,751
I don't know what you do to me, sir, but

3643
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:18,401
you just make it come out
every single time.

3644
02:16:18,484 --> 02:16:21,001
Just comes out
every single time we call up.

3645
02:16:21,001 --> 02:16:21,968
Yeah.

3646
02:16:23,168 --> 02:16:25,268
I mean, I don't know what I do to you
either.

3647
02:16:25,268 --> 02:16:25,618
I'll do it.

3648
02:16:25,618 --> 02:16:26,735
I'll do more of it.

3649
02:16:26,735 --> 02:16:29,069
You talking like that, though?

3650
02:16:30,035 --> 02:16:32,736
Oh, no.

3651
02:16:32,736 --> 02:16:35,186
Oh. Oh, hold on, hold on. I'll fix that.

3652
02:16:35,253 --> 02:16:37,886
Oh, God, bro.

3653
02:16:38,553 --> 02:16:39,653
OK, I need more rice,

3654
02:16:39,653 --> 02:16:42,837
more rice, more ricer, more ricer.

3655
02:16:43,437 --> 02:16:43,753
I think.

3656
02:16:45,304 --> 02:16:46,170
One of the rice fell and.

3657
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:48,054
Projectile rice.

3658
02:16:48,054 --> 02:16:49,321
I think I need meat.

3659
02:16:49,321 --> 02:16:50,704
Is there cooked meat over there?

3660
02:16:50,704 --> 02:16:52,321
There is cooked meat ready for you?

3661
02:16:52,321 --> 02:16:55,171
OK, I'll grab it all.

3662
02:16:55,205 --> 02:16:55,805
Yeah, yeah. Any meat?

3663
02:16:55,805 --> 02:16:57,488
Any meat? Real bad. And another rice.

3664
02:16:57,488 --> 02:16:59,038
I need another rice ASAP.

3665
02:16:59,038 --> 02:16:59,788
And one more rice.

3666
02:16:59,788 --> 02:17:00,338
Gotcha.

3667
02:17:04,255 --> 02:17:04,689
Thank you.

3668
02:17:04,689 --> 02:17:05,606
Thank you, sir.

3669
02:17:05,606 --> 02:17:07,956
Four, six, six, six.

3670
02:17:10,406 --> 02:17:10,856
And that's here.

3671
02:17:10,856 --> 02:17:12,906
That's your lucky number, isn't it?

3672
02:17:12,906 --> 02:17:13,523
It is.

3673
02:17:13,523 --> 02:17:14,706
It is. And there we go. We do.

3674
02:17:14,706 --> 02:17:16,857
Clearly, we're going to win this.

3675
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:18,457
Toss me a shroom.

3676
02:17:18,457 --> 02:17:19,624
Toss me a shroom boy.

3677
02:17:19,624 --> 02:17:21,840
Sir. Sherm, hold on. Here we go.

3678
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:22,691
Here's my mushroom.

3679
02:17:22,691 --> 02:17:25,074
I want so badly.

3680
02:17:27,774 --> 02:17:30,308
And I think we're good here.

3681
02:17:30,308 --> 02:17:32,908
I just think. Meats, more meats.

3682
02:17:33,875 --> 02:17:34,825
Thank you.

3683
02:17:34,825 --> 02:17:38,192
It's a dirty dish. The inside of the meat.

3684
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:39,926
Oh, my God.

3685
02:17:39,926 --> 02:17:41,759
I died of the meat.

3686
02:17:41,759 --> 02:17:42,876
That's incredible.

3687
02:17:42,876 --> 02:17:45,243
Oh, it can't be dying with my meat.

3688
02:17:48,626 --> 02:17:49,593
Can you not?

3689
02:17:49,893 --> 02:17:50,460
Oh, my God.

3690
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,793
Can you let me do what I need to do?

3691
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:56,494
I was scared.

3692
02:17:56,494 --> 02:17:57,144
I saw the meat.

3693
02:17:57,144 --> 02:18:01,044
I saw the meat burning or, like,
the mushroom burning on.

3694
02:18:01,078 --> 02:18:02,278
I'll grab that ASAP.

3695
02:18:02,278 --> 02:18:03,728
And then you just worry
about the other stuff.

3696
02:18:03,728 --> 02:18:05,245
I think. I think we got this.

3697
02:18:05,245 --> 02:18:06,778
OK, we got this.

3698
02:18:06,778 --> 02:18:09,128
Five, four, one modish
one more high school.

3699
02:18:09,128 --> 02:18:09,812
High school.

3700

Oh, my God. Oh,

3707
02:18:24,097 --> 02:18:25,197
that wasn't so bad.

3708
02:18:25,197 --> 02:18:27,814
Like we said. Yeah, I said.

3709
02:18:27,814 --> 02:18:28,897
Good job.

02:18:29,047 --> 02:18:30,514
Good job.

3715
02:18:39,365 --> 02:18:40,498
Where do you go. From wearing it?

3716
02:18:40,498 --> 02:18:43,165
Oh, you're wearing it yeah.

3717
02:18:43,165 --> 02:18:44,065

I can't see it, but. Yeah.

3719
02:18:46,232 --> 02:18:48,632
Yeah. No way. I didn't mean to do that.

3720
02:18:49,082 --> 02:18:50,933
Would I keep doing that?

3721
02:18:50,933 --> 02:18:52,466
My my brain is just like, all right.

3722
02:18:52,466 --> 02:18:54,450
We've failed.
We have to go to the other one.

3723
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:54,966
Yeah.

3724
02:18:54,983 --> 02:18:55,500

3727
02:19:02,817 --> 02:19:04,934
We haven't cooked a single burger
in a lot.

3728
02:19:05,467 --> 02:19:06,717
I can't believe we haven't.

3729
02:19:06,717 --> 02:19:09,218
Bought their burger.

3730
02:19:09,218 --> 02:19:11,401
But we get.

3731
02:19:11,401 --> 02:19:12,385
In some french fries.

3732
02:19:12,385 --> 02:19:12,718
Oh, no.

3733
02:19:12,718 --> 02:19:15,135
We have cooked french fries. Burger,

3734
02:19:16,135 --> 02:19:17,485
no burger.

3735
02:19:17,485 --> 02:19:18,652
Barely

3736
02:19:20,102 --> 02:19:22,086
an apple.

3737
02:19:22,086 --> 02:19:23,136
When you tickle someone's.

3738
02:19:23,136 --> 02:19:24,936
Balls, you imagine like it goes like

3739
02:19:27,153 --> 02:19:28,653
like that. No.

3740
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:32,903
Believe it or not, no.

3741
02:19:34,303 --> 02:19:37,020
It's a it's a very valid question
I had to ask.

3742
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:39,337
Oh, my God, this is confusing.

3743
02:19:39,337 --> 02:19:40,554
This is confusing already.

3744
02:19:40,554 --> 02:19:42,538
I think I should handle the rice as usual.

3745
02:19:42,538 --> 02:19:44,488
Oh, no.

3746
02:19:44,488 --> 02:19:46,171
You got to be shitting me.

3747
02:19:46,171 --> 02:19:47,855
Why are you fucking my dick?

3748
02:19:47,855 --> 02:19:49,805
Do we really have to, like, alternate.

3749
02:19:49,805 --> 02:19:51,905
Between ingredients. Like that?

3750
02:19:51,905 --> 02:19:53,189
Oh, my God.

3751
02:19:53,189 --> 02:19:53,522
Oh, no.

3752
02:19:53,522 --> 02:19:54,755
I'm already stretched out.

3753
02:19:54,755 --> 02:19:56,606
I'm overstressed until I.

3754
02:19:56,606 --> 02:19:58,522
We haven't even started.

3755
02:20:00,889 --> 02:20:02,456
You decided to just.

3756
02:20:02,456 --> 02:20:04,690
Oh, I stood there and it all.

3757
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:07,173
I will take it all now.

3758
02:20:08,490 --> 02:20:10,740
OK, there's meats right there.

3759
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,524
There's more meats.

3760
02:20:12,524 --> 02:20:15,241
Are we don't need that meat right now.

3761
02:20:15,874 --> 02:20:17,908
I mean, this meat's

3762
02:20:19,675 --> 02:20:20,575

02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:21,958
wait.

3764
02:20:21,958 --> 02:20:24,758
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3765
02:20:24,758 --> 02:20:26,375
And then you need the broth.

3766
02:20:26,375 --> 02:20:28,359
The meat survived. The meat survived.

3767
02:20:28,359 --> 02:20:30,759
Dude.
Pug, wait. While the meat outlived me.

3768
02:20:31,776 --> 02:20:32,009
Hold on.

3769
02:20:32,009 --> 02:20:35,276
I need
the burrito, the tortilla tortilla thingy,

3770
02:20:35,793 --> 02:20:39,326
and then another tortilla.

3771
02:20:39,993 --> 02:20:41,493
Grab the tortilla.

3772
02:20:41,493 --> 02:20:42,443
Thank you.

3773
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:46,811
Oh, my God.

3774
02:20:47,494 --> 02:20:49,344
There's so much happening.

3775
02:20:50,228 --> 02:20:50,528
Yeah.

3776
02:20:51,811 --> 02:20:52,678
I'm hyperventilating.

3777
02:20:52,678 --> 02:20:53,878
I want to go home.

3778
02:20:56,095 --> 02:20:57,428
Is this really worth saving?

3779
02:20:57,428 --> 02:20:58,862
The kingdom over.

3780
02:20:59,228 --> 02:21:01,595
Oh, cranberry.

3781
02:21:01,629 --> 02:21:02,995
As in this weird of an environment.

3782
02:21:02,995 --> 02:21:07,079
I'm going to. OK.

3783
02:21:08,463 --> 02:21:10,763
Wow. I know what that means.

Got it.

3787
02:21:21,814 --> 02:21:25,948
OK, we got more and more plates ready

3788
02:21:28,115 --> 02:21:30,148
and then I put two rice in.

3789
02:21:30,148 --> 02:21:32,798
No, that's fucking chicken.

3790
02:21:33,815 --> 02:21:35,032
Jessie

3791
02:21:35,432 --> 02:21:37,716

3792
02:21:39,932 --> 02:21:40,349
due to.

3793
02:21:40,349 --> 02:21:44,066
All I know is rice. Oh,

02:21:45,216 --> 02:21:46,533
OK. Those are cooking now.

3795
02:21:46,533 --> 02:21:47,767
What? How?

3796
02:21:47,767 --> 02:21:48,183
What do you mean?

3797
02:21:48,183 --> 02:21:50,433

3800
02:21:56,334 --> 02:21:57,451
Dude. Oh, shit.

3801
02:21:57,451 --> 02:21:58,534
Oh, shit is ok.

3802
02:21:58,534 --> 02:22:01,118
It's not looking so as a burrito.

3803
02:22:01,118 --> 02:22:03,151
It's not. It's not looking so hot.

3804
02:22:03,151 --> 02:22:04,501
I fall off.

3805
02:22:04,501 --> 02:22:06,085
Dude, I was looking at you and I thought

3806
02:22:07,885 --> 02:22:08,335
you're working.

3807
02:22:08,335 --> 02:22:09,369
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3808
02:22:09,369 --> 02:22:11,402
Oh, fuck me. Oh, fuck, dammit.

3809
02:22:11,752 --> 02:22:13,202
Well, ok.

3810
02:22:13,202 --> 02:22:16,319
OK, ok. OK. OK.

3811
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:17,819
I think we do.

3812
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:20,670
We just lose a saucepan forever.

3813
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:21,303
No, it comes back.

3814
02:22:21,303 --> 02:22:21,987
It comes back.

3815
02:22:21,987 --> 02:22:24,653
OK, hang on, hang on. Hang on.

3816
02:22:24,653 --> 02:22:26,637
Where's the fire extinguisher?

3817
02:22:26,637 --> 02:22:28,204
Fire extinguisher.

3818
02:22:32,104 --> 02:22:33,788
OK. All right.

3819
02:22:34,138 --> 02:22:36,638
Seems it seems like. All they. All like.

3820
02:22:36,638 --> 02:22:38,938
Everything is is
everything is going to shit.

3821
02:22:38,938 --> 02:22:41,855
Oh, it seems like everything's gone
to shit, right?

3822
02:22:41,855 --> 02:22:44,855
Googly moodily
everything's gone to fucking hell.

3823
02:22:45,272 --> 02:22:46,922
I don't know what's the deal.

3824
02:22:46,922 --> 02:22:48,656
I don't know what the deal.

3825
02:22:49,773 --> 02:22:52,440
Do something, you fucking idiot.

3826
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,406
We're Fox or fox, bro.

3827
02:22:55,406 --> 02:22:56,607
I know what to do.

3828
02:22:56,607 --> 02:22:58,407
Oh, fuck you.

3829
02:22:58,407 --> 02:22:58,707
Yeah.

3830
02:22:58,707 --> 02:23:01,207
You ever, ever
stop moving in my kitchen like that again.

3831
02:23:01,207 --> 02:23:03,091
I'll send you over
and make you wish you was sorry.

3832
02:23:04,207 --> 02:23:07,924
Oh. You make it really, really hard.

3833
02:23:08,158 --> 02:23:10,825
Not so what I take the offer.

3834
02:23:10,825 --> 02:23:14,125
Is that what I'm trying to say? No.

3835
02:23:14,158 --> 02:23:16,109
To obey, maybe.

3836
02:23:16,109 --> 02:23:17,775
Laugh now

3837
02:23:18,509 --> 02:23:21,209
now, for now, we focus on the cooking.

3838
02:23:21,209 --> 02:23:22,042
All right?

3839
02:23:22,076 --> 02:23:24,393
Yeah. Sorry, we. Got. Plus,
I got philosophy this time.

3840
02:23:24,393 --> 02:23:26,843
I got flustered this time. Dude,
the noise, the mechanics.

3841
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:28,943
I don't talk to you again.

3842
02:23:28,943 --> 02:23:29,610
I'm just go grab.

3843
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:31,227
All the rice that's necessary.

3844
02:23:31,227 --> 02:23:31,477
Oh, no.

3845
02:23:31,477 --> 02:23:33,144
You grab all the rice

3846
02:23:36,444 --> 02:23:37,044
the rice.

3847
02:23:37,044 --> 02:23:37,894
The rice.

3848
02:23:38,677 --> 02:23:39,061
Yeah, ok.

3849
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:40,644
OK, I'll put the rice on immediately.

3850
02:23:40,644 --> 02:23:41,494
OK, I'll start.

3851
02:23:41,494 --> 02:23:43,795
I'll start
cooking the chicken in the meat.

3852
02:23:44,161 --> 02:23:44,561
In the dude.

3853
02:23:44,561 --> 02:23:45,745
He doesn't like

3854
02:23:46,445 --> 02:23:48,628
having chicken and meat on that side. OK.

3855
02:23:48,895 --> 02:23:50,245
I'll start. I'll start chopping.

3856
02:23:50,245 --> 02:23:51,345
Chop, chop, chop.

3857
02:23:51,345 --> 02:23:53,846
Are you ready for another little of meat?

3858
02:23:55,596 --> 02:23:57,513
Rice is done playing that up.

3859
02:23:57,513 --> 02:24:00,213
And throw these over.

3860
02:24:00,663 --> 02:24:03,713
I think I see what I have to do now.

3861
02:24:04,347 --> 02:24:04,797
I know what I.

3862
02:24:04,797 --> 02:24:05,513
Have to do.

3863
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:11,347
OK, these these are all cooking.

3864
02:24:11,347 --> 02:24:13,497
These are all cooking right now.

3865
02:24:15,214 --> 02:24:18,815
Wait throw those over there.

3866
02:24:20,348 --> 02:24:21,548
All right,

3867
02:24:24,899 --> 02:24:25,465
OK. This is.

3868
02:24:25,465 --> 02:24:26,465
Ready. No.

3869
02:24:26,465 --> 02:24:28,766
Yeah, yeah, you can. You can turn that.
You can stand that.

3870
02:24:28,766 --> 02:24:30,599
You can stand all over. Yeah,
actually now.

3871
02:24:30,599 --> 02:24:33,233
OK, if you focus, like, if you do that one
well, let's go step one. Each

3872
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:35,283
chicken done.

3873
02:24:35,283 --> 02:24:38,017
OK, let's get
the rice is giving us a bang.

3874
02:24:38,017 --> 02:24:39,333
But you got to rest.
You have the rice, ok?

3875
02:24:39,333 --> 02:24:41,067
OK. Yeah, if I can. Wait, wait.

3876
02:24:41,067 --> 02:24:42,367
Let me just grab those.

3877
02:24:42,367 --> 02:24:45,067
This chicken's ready.
I'm going to chop more chopped, more meat

3878
02:24:47,784 --> 02:24:49,768
and I'm
going to send that over to the grill.

3879
02:24:49,768 --> 02:24:51,901
I'm going to cook more chicken as well.

3880
02:24:54,518 --> 02:24:56,218
Just a bunch of chicken

3881
02:24:56,402 --> 02:24:57,385
loses.

3882
02:24:57,902 --> 02:25:00,635
Wow. I wasn't

3883
02:25:03,786 --> 02:25:05,653
I think I got something going here.

3884
02:25:05,653 --> 02:25:07,236
You have something special.

3885
02:25:07,236 --> 02:25:08,003
You got something?

3886
02:25:08,003 --> 02:25:09,603
Something special, Dave?

3887
02:25:09,603 --> 02:25:10,120
Yeah.

3888
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:14,037
I wish I could flip back,
but I'm concentrating.

3889
02:25:14,437 --> 02:25:15,587
White rice. Rice.

3890
02:25:15,587 --> 02:25:16,687
I'll get your rice ready.

3891
02:25:16,687 --> 02:25:18,787
I'll put some rice. And for you

3892
02:25:18,904 --> 02:25:19,687
here, you

3893
02:25:27,905 --> 02:25:30,055
I think my meat disappeared.

3894
02:25:32,589 --> 02:25:34,439
OK. Ah!

3895
02:25:34,439 --> 02:25:36,639
Oh, my. God. There's so much.
There's dirty plates, right?

3896
02:25:36,639 --> 02:25:38,039
We got to watch out for the dirty plates.

3897
02:25:38,039 --> 02:25:42,756
Fuck go.

3898
02:25:43,056 --> 02:25:45,506

Yeah, I'll be. I'll be the hero.

02:25:49,324 --> 02:25:51,840
I'll be the the the Barry tearoom.

3902
02:25:52,957 --> 02:25:53,857
The Barry hero.

3903
02:25:54,924 --> 02:25:55,841
Here, I'll throw another one out.

3904
02:25:55,841 --> 02:25:57,724
You all throw another one. Fuck me.

3905
02:25:57,724 --> 02:25:58,224
Grab it, grab it.

3906
02:25:58,224 --> 02:26:02,758
Graphic wow.

3907
02:26:02,975 --> 02:26:04,025
OK, this one's hard.

3908
02:26:04,025 --> 02:26:06,058
This one's, like,
actually pretty damn hard.

3909
02:26:06,759 --> 02:26:07,525
Yeah. Yeah.

3910
02:26:08,425 --> 02:26:10,776
Well, you don't use timing hard on.

3911
02:26:11,842 --> 02:26:13,776
You're acting like.

3912
02:26:14,109 --> 02:26:16,893
That's beside the point, sir.

3913
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:20,127
Chef. Fuck you.

3914
02:26:20,127 --> 02:26:21,593
Such that.

3915
02:26:21,593 --> 02:26:23,677
Just shut up about that.

3916
02:26:23,827 --> 02:26:25,744
There are a.

3917
02:26:26,244 --> 02:26:27,577
Few more dishes.

3918
02:26:27,577 --> 02:26:28,711
Oh, no VOCs.

3919
02:26:28,711 --> 02:26:29,527
Oh, no.

3920
02:26:29,527 --> 02:26:32,328
Oh, oh, no. Oh,

3921
02:26:33,578 --> 02:26:34,545
oh, no.

3922
02:26:34,545 --> 02:26:36,595
Oh, I. There's so many.

3923
02:26:36,695 --> 02:26:38,878
The bridesmaids. Wear. Them.

3924
02:26:39,062 --> 02:26:41,429
Give me the fucking. Lights.

3925
02:26:41,429 --> 02:26:43,729
And cleaning.
I'm cleaning the plates, chef.

3926
02:26:43,779 --> 02:26:44,196
Yeah.

3927
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:46,312
Oh, God.

3928
02:26:48,813 --> 02:26:50,196
Oh, my God.

3929
02:26:50,196 --> 02:26:51,963
Oh, my God.

3930
02:26:51,963 --> 02:26:55,263
Oh, my God.

3931
02:26:55,263 --> 02:26:56,313
Bang!

3932
02:26:56,313 --> 02:26:57,664
Three, three, three.

3933
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:59,914
Yeah. Oh, dude.

3934
02:27:00,247 --> 02:27:03,897
Rigging belts by this one.

3935
02:27:04,564 --> 02:27:05,431
All right, let's absolutely.

3936
02:27:05,431 --> 02:27:07,615
100 more points. We failed three orders.

3937
02:27:07,615 --> 02:27:09,031
So as long as we don't do that

3938
02:27:09,031 --> 02:27:12,182
and we actually focus on what we're doing,
we can make this one work. OK.

3939
02:27:12,515 --> 02:27:13,298
Y'all, we had it.

3940
02:27:13,298 --> 02:27:14,315
We had in the beginning.

3941
02:27:14,315 --> 02:27:16,499
Then all of a sudden, it just slips away.

3942
02:27:16,499 --> 02:27:17,065
Yeah.

3943
02:27:17,065 --> 02:27:19,382
All of a sudden,
shutters meet, disappeared.

3944
02:27:20,482 --> 02:27:21,299
I mean, you fell down the

3945
02:27:21,299 --> 02:27:24,233
hole till I was the thing that's true.

3946
02:27:24,483 --> 02:27:26,283
I'm going to holes. You.

3947
02:27:26,283 --> 02:27:27,083
I like holes.

3948
02:27:27,083 --> 02:27:29,933
I'm sorry
that I keep falling into your hole, but.

3949
02:27:30,267 --> 02:27:33,434
My hole is maybe.

3950
02:27:33,667 --> 02:27:34,984
Maybe it's not much.

3951
02:27:34,984 --> 02:27:35,884
If you were our.

3952
02:27:35,884 --> 02:27:39,334
It's our whole share. Oh.

3953
02:27:39,868 --> 02:27:41,768
It's our collective hole.

3954
02:27:41,768 --> 02:27:42,385
Right?

3955
02:27:42,385 --> 02:27:44,668
When you
when I said I fell into your hole,

3956
02:27:45,718 --> 02:27:46,168
you said that.

3957
02:27:46,168 --> 02:27:46,952
You said it was all.

3958
02:27:46,952 --> 02:27:49,835
So I'm like, damn,
what the hell you saying?

3959
02:27:49,835 --> 02:27:50,619
I'm yours.

3960
02:27:50,619 --> 02:27:53,669
Our hole like your mine.

3961
02:27:55,353 --> 02:27:58,136
Stop putting words into my mouth.

3962
02:27:58,536 --> 02:28:00,903
I did not say that.

3963
02:28:00,903 --> 02:28:02,337
And see that

3964
02:28:03,003 --> 02:28:05,153
water yourself, demon.

3965
02:28:05,153 --> 02:28:07,104
OK, fine. For myself, I find myself.

3966
02:28:07,104 --> 02:28:09,387
I think you'd like me to

3967
02:28:10,954 --> 02:28:11,154
this.

3968
02:28:11,154 --> 02:28:12,654
All this is.

3969
02:28:12,654 --> 02:28:14,754
Just for the game.
This is just for the game, OK?

3970
02:28:14,938 --> 02:28:15,671
Nothing else.

3971
02:28:15,671 --> 02:28:16,138
You know.

3972
02:28:16,138 --> 02:28:18,688
That's
just because I'm. We're trying to win.

3973
02:28:18,688 --> 02:28:20,305
I'm trying to win. You know, that's like.

3974
02:28:20,305 --> 02:28:22,355
It's like nowadays. It's
nothing more than about.

3975
02:28:22,805 --> 02:28:24,039
The game. It's for the win.

3976
02:28:24,039 --> 02:28:26,139
No, I understand. I do. I do. I really do.

3977
02:28:28,206 --> 02:28:29,573
With your meats

3978
02:28:30,089 --> 02:28:31,506
and your chicken.

3979
02:28:31,506 --> 02:28:33,390
OK. Good job.

3980
02:28:33,390 --> 02:28:35,907
Good job, old guy.

3981
02:28:40,107 --> 02:28:42,174
There, rice and the grab your rice.

3982
02:28:42,174 --> 02:28:42,957
You got it.

3983
02:28:45,691 --> 02:28:47,674
OK, this chicken's ready.

3984
02:28:47,674 --> 02:28:48,958
All right? And got some days.

3985
02:28:48,958 --> 02:28:50,458
So you knocked me off.

3986
02:28:50,458 --> 02:28:52,591
You literally pushed me to the side.

3987
02:28:52,591 --> 02:28:54,775
You fucking fucking. Mouth.

3988
02:28:55,075 --> 02:28:56,909
Shut your fucking mouth.
I'll keep knocking you off.

3989
02:28:56,909 --> 02:28:57,492
And then if you keep.

3990
02:28:57,492 --> 02:29:00,126
Why you keep doing this? Why, why?
Why are you yelling?

3991
02:29:00,126 --> 02:29:00,809
Why you are knocking it?

3992
02:29:00,809 --> 02:29:03,276
What's what's the what's the
what do you get?

3993
02:29:03,276 --> 02:29:05,576
What do you get from this, huh?
I don't understand.

3994
02:29:06,209 --> 02:29:08,843
It. Laugh really bad banter.

3995
02:29:09,243 --> 02:29:10,643
That's
that's like how you threw it onto the.

3996
02:29:10,643 --> 02:29:11,493
Oh, my God.

3997
02:29:11,493 --> 02:29:14,327
Oh, my God. Wrong, wrong way.

3998
02:29:14,327 --> 02:29:15,627
You have to chop it up first.

3999
02:29:17,577 --> 02:29:18,961
Chop you up.

4000
02:29:24,278 --> 02:29:24,811
Make it,

4001
02:29:24,811 --> 02:29:29,528
make it difficult to ah,
it's it's a think to focus in the kitchen.

4002
02:29:29,528 --> 02:29:30,479
You know, what.

4003
02:29:30,929 --> 02:29:32,279
Do I really wirehouses?

4004
02:29:32,279 --> 02:29:33,329
It sounds it's talent.

4005
02:29:33,329 --> 02:29:36,062
It's a it's really a talent of yours.

4006
02:29:36,062 --> 02:29:37,313
Russell. I'm talent. I am, too.

4007
02:29:37,313 --> 02:29:38,913
I have a natural talent
for distracting you.

4008
02:29:38,913 --> 02:29:41,963
Wow. You could be more obvious
if you tried.

4009
02:29:42,213 --> 02:29:44,613
Just just take the meat here.

4010
02:29:44,663 --> 02:29:46,880
Here you go. Actually,
not delivering meat.

4011
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:48,414
I don't think I want to take yours.
You can take mine.

4012
02:29:48,414 --> 02:29:50,647
You grab the chicken,
you grab the chicken, grab the chicken.

4013
02:29:50,647 --> 02:29:52,147
Fuck.
I'll grab the chicken. I got. I got it.

4014
02:29:52,147 --> 02:29:53,864
I got it. Oh,

4015
02:29:56,198 --> 02:29:57,064
ok. OK.

4016
02:29:57,064 --> 02:29:59,348
Rice, rice, rice.

4017
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:01,615
Oh, no.

4018
02:30:01,615 --> 02:30:02,365
Oh, my God.

4019
02:30:02,365 --> 02:30:06,182
I almost fell off of the order because you
fucking threw the me in my face.

4020
02:30:06,332 --> 02:30:08,849
It literally. No. Oh, my God. It

4021
02:30:10,316 --> 02:30:12,083
all my own luck.

4022
02:30:12,083 --> 02:30:14,116
Oh, that's fucking karma of karma, bitch.

4023
02:30:14,583 --> 02:30:15,233
No, no.

4024
02:30:15,233 --> 02:30:15,566
We'll get them.

4025
02:30:15,566 --> 02:30:18,267
We'll get. All.

4026
02:30:19,267 --> 02:30:19,800
We got all that.

4027
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:22,917
We got it. Don't panic. Don't panic.

4028
02:30:22,917 --> 02:30:24,234
Oh, God.

4029
02:30:28,201 --> 02:30:30,218
Oh, it was your pot down here.

4030
02:30:30,218 --> 02:30:31,234
There you go.

4031
02:30:34,201 --> 02:30:35,618
OK, meat's ready.

4032
02:30:35,618 --> 02:30:36,302
It's ready.

4033
02:30:36,302 --> 02:30:36,818
It's ready.

4034
02:30:36,818 --> 02:30:38,969
Borderline black rice noodles.

4035
02:30:42,069 --> 02:30:43,102
Await today.

4036
02:30:43,102 --> 02:30:44,452
I fuck up. No, I didn't fuck up. Hey.

4037
02:30:44,452 --> 02:30:49,103
Hey, pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.

4038
02:30:49,886 --> 02:30:51,153
Listen, the BSF might be listening.

4039
02:30:51,153 --> 02:30:53,603
Don't violate the programme, OK?

4040
02:30:54,187 --> 02:30:56,037
Fuck the visa.

4041
02:30:56,037 --> 02:30:57,937
Oh, don't don't tell Sunny.

4042
02:30:57,937 --> 02:30:59,604
Please don't tell Sunny.

4043
02:31:01,437 --> 02:31:02,404
He doesn't know prison.

4044
02:31:02,404 --> 02:31:03,504
You as you know.

4045
02:31:03,504 --> 02:31:05,254
That's that's a thought crime
you're going to get.

4046
02:31:05,254 --> 02:31:07,388
You're going to go away for a long time.

4047
02:31:07,388 --> 02:31:09,305
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

4048
02:31:12,188 --> 02:31:12,989
Do we got it.

4049
02:31:12,989 --> 02:31:13,555
By the way?

4050
02:31:13,555 --> 02:31:16,139
I think. I think we might have done.

4051
02:31:16,289 --> 02:31:16,706
Yeah.

4052
02:31:16,706 --> 02:31:21,389
Oh, that's definitely just barely.

4053
02:31:21,723 --> 02:31:23,823
Oh, barely above.

4054
02:31:23,823 --> 02:31:25,773
I like 14 points.

4055
02:31:25,773 --> 02:31:29,007
Oh, oh, oh.

4056
02:31:31,074 --> 02:31:32,607
That was really good. I like those grunts.

4057
02:31:32,607 --> 02:31:33,691
You do it again

4058
02:31:34,657 --> 02:31:35,674
a little slower.

4059
02:31:35,674 --> 02:31:38,224
A little bit more like,
you know, passion, like.

4060
02:31:38,224 --> 02:31:41,675
Oh, you can do some eating
and do some for me too.

4061
02:31:41,675 --> 02:31:42,475
If you do it first.

4062
02:31:42,475 --> 02:31:43,075
Yeah.

4063
02:31:44,825 --> 02:31:45,392
Oh, no.

4064
02:31:45,392 --> 02:31:46,892
I mean, maybe,
maybe you got to get them out of maybe.

4065
02:31:46,892 --> 02:31:48,959
You do it first, if you don't mind.

4066
02:31:48,959 --> 02:31:50,226
You don't want to be that easy.

4067
02:31:50,226 --> 02:31:51,542
Maybe. I mean, I know it works for you,

4068
02:31:51,542 --> 02:31:53,126
but I don't really know
if I want to be that easy.

4069
02:31:53,126 --> 02:31:54,059
Let me be that easy.

4070
02:31:54,059 --> 02:31:54,843
This is an agreement.

4071
02:31:54,843 --> 02:31:57,126
We're making a deal, you know.

4072
02:31:57,126 --> 02:31:58,776
As a business man doing business

4073
02:32:02,693 --> 02:32:03,477
oh, my God.

4074
02:32:03,477 --> 02:32:06,294
We get to make burger

4075
02:32:06,594 --> 02:32:08,527
all of that stuff.

4076
02:32:08,527 --> 02:32:11,828
Yeah, what the fuck was that noise?

4077
02:32:12,878 --> 02:32:15,328
I've been I've been going
I've been going slightly silly mode,

4078
02:32:15,328 --> 02:32:18,428
and I just keep saying words
and in stupid ways, I think.

4079
02:32:18,428 --> 02:32:19,195
I think it's all right.

4080
02:32:19,195 --> 02:32:21,662
Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK,
so the time is frozen, right?

4081
02:32:22,045 --> 02:32:24,362
Let's just figure out
how this is working for us, ok? OK.

4082
02:32:24,696 --> 02:32:25,862
Brains are going to be silly.

4083
02:32:25,862 --> 02:32:27,779
And every time something ends in an E.R.

4084
02:32:27,779 --> 02:32:30,096
or an O.R., I keep like, saying weird.

4085
02:32:30,996 --> 02:32:33,146
Like, whenever I make something
with a pepper, I'll just pick it up

4086
02:32:33,146 --> 02:32:33,746
and be like.

4087
02:32:33,846 --> 02:32:37,313
We bought a play board. And.

4088
02:32:37,747 --> 02:32:39,130
Boogie. Boogie anything.

4089
02:32:39,130 --> 02:32:41,047
Interesting. Together?

4090
02:32:41,047 --> 02:32:44,014
All right, so it looks like this is going
to, like, rotate, basically.

4091
02:32:44,364 --> 02:32:45,698
Yeah. There you go. All

4092
02:32:47,498 --> 02:32:48,515
this is cool.

4093
02:32:48,515 --> 02:32:50,315
This is cruel and unusual punishment.

4094
02:32:50,315 --> 02:32:54,665
Lockouts, and it's all it's
going to lock us in a certain segment.

4095
02:32:54,665 --> 02:32:57,699
So how are we going to do this?

4096
02:32:57,699 --> 02:32:59,282
We have to worry right now
because the time is not.

4097
02:32:59,282 --> 02:33:01,883
Yeah, if I put it on the plate,
it doesn't even start yet.

4098
02:33:01,883 --> 02:33:03,266
So we could, like.

4099
02:33:03,266 --> 02:33:05,966
Pre-Plan and it doesn't start
until you do the first order.

4100
02:33:06,083 --> 02:33:08,783
Yeah. So we could,

4101
02:33:08,783 --> 02:33:10,917
you know, we could just.

4102
02:33:11,283 --> 02:33:12,900
Begin like that.

4103
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:15,384
And then we can also throw

4104
02:33:15,584 --> 02:33:17,117
we can throw like that

4105
02:33:20,184 --> 02:33:20,884
mm hmm.

4106
02:33:21,484 --> 02:33:22,685
I'd like to make sure.

4107
02:33:22,685 --> 02:33:25,952
OK, so the main thing is making sure
that we don't get stuck on the same side

4108
02:33:25,952 --> 02:33:27,985
because then certain things
just aren't going to be doable.

4109
02:33:29,185 --> 02:33:29,852
Oh, wait, you.

4110
02:33:29,852 --> 02:33:31,735
You could, you could just walk around.

4111
02:33:31,735 --> 02:33:33,036
All of us are. No.

4112
02:33:34,019 --> 02:33:34,236
Here.

4113
02:33:34,236 --> 02:33:36,436
We all. Know. Where's the chopping block.

4114
02:33:36,436 --> 02:33:37,536
The over on your side.

4115
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:39,153
Oh, why is the cheese on it.

4116
02:33:39,153 --> 02:33:42,570
I can't cut. It out that the cheese
over there and I happen to land on it.

4117
02:33:44,153 --> 02:33:46,920
Oh, fuck. OK.

4118
02:33:48,054 --> 02:33:48,837
All right.

4119
02:33:49,304 --> 02:33:50,887
There go.

4120
02:33:51,487 --> 02:33:53,671
All we have to cut the cheese.

4121
02:33:53,671 --> 02:33:54,388
Oops.

4122
02:33:55,354 --> 02:33:57,938
You know,
I think I think burgers are a bit better

4123
02:33:58,138 --> 02:34:01,238
if you if you melt the cheese
while you're frying the burger.

4124
02:34:01,238 --> 02:34:02,672
Yeah, I like that idea.

4125
02:34:02,672 --> 02:34:05,739
I don't know why we're let's say
we're not even

4126
02:34:06,906 --> 02:34:09,089
maybe, like,
having the whole cheese on a burger.

4127
02:34:09,089 --> 02:34:11,606
Sounds so gross to me. Yeah, I, like.

4128
02:34:11,873 --> 02:34:13,173
Know, melt the cheese.

4129
02:34:13,173 --> 02:34:13,806
That's that's over.

4130
02:34:13,806 --> 02:34:15,873
That's a real man's way of doing it.

4131
02:34:15,873 --> 02:34:20,307
That's already dude,
I think we can just finesse this.

4132
02:34:21,474 --> 02:34:21,907
Yeah, we can.

4133
02:34:21,907 --> 02:34:24,191
We can just get a ton of burgers, right?
There's, like.

4134
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:25,707
My, my, my, my, my, my way.

4135
02:34:25,707 --> 02:34:29,158
But some of them don't. Want some cheese.

4136
02:34:29,158 --> 02:34:29,641
Fine.

4137
02:34:29,641 --> 02:34:31,625
It's fine. We'll have them ready.

4138
02:34:32,008 --> 02:34:34,258
Let's have three with cheese
and one with out.

4139
02:34:34,625 --> 02:34:37,325
OK? OK, so this one can go there.

4140
02:34:37,325 --> 02:34:38,459
Yeah,

4141
02:34:40,409 --> 02:34:42,276
someone's talking about creamy burger.

4142
02:34:42,276 --> 02:34:43,376
A creamy burger.

4143
02:34:43,376 --> 02:34:44,043
What's

4144
02:34:46,943 --> 02:34:47,310
I think?

4145
02:34:47,310 --> 02:34:49,176
I just think that she's off

4146
02:34:50,343 --> 02:34:52,193
the I just through the cheese off.

4147
02:34:52,227 --> 02:34:53,243
Oh, shit.

4148
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,160
That's OK. It's OK.

4149
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:56,877
We can recover.

4150
02:34:56,877 --> 02:34:58,761
We have one with me.

4151
02:34:58,761 --> 02:35:00,878
Two to one with me, one with just cheese.

4152
02:35:01,194 --> 02:35:03,895
All right, wait. One sandwich.

4153
02:35:04,495 --> 02:35:05,545
OK, hold on.

4154
02:35:05,545 --> 02:35:06,728
You know, some people like that.

4155
02:35:06,728 --> 02:35:09,278
Some people just like having a grilled
cheese like that. And there we. Go.

4156
02:35:09,395 --> 02:35:11,995
We have full plate burgers.
All right, do you want to do get going?

4157
02:35:12,245 --> 02:35:14,046
OK, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

4158
02:35:14,046 --> 02:35:16,246
Let me just prep some mouth.

4159
02:35:16,596 --> 02:35:18,846
Let me just move, bitch.

4160
02:35:19,346 --> 02:35:21,780
Move my just so much cheese.

4161
02:35:22,413 --> 02:35:24,413
I'm just I'm just prepping
I'm just prepping.

4162
02:35:25,197 --> 02:35:25,947
I'm preloading

4163
02:35:28,047 --> 02:35:30,264
You ever heard of pre-loading,

4164
02:35:30,264 --> 02:35:31,764
sir? Shut.

4165
02:35:31,764 --> 02:35:32,847
God, why do I keep doing that?

4166
02:35:32,847 --> 02:35:35,464
I keep calling you sirens, though, chef.

4167
02:35:35,464 --> 02:35:37,348
I think it might be just
sort of ingrained.

4168
02:35:37,348 --> 02:35:37,898
You know?

4169
02:35:37,915 --> 02:35:40,198
I mean, you haven't ever heard of Freudian
slip.

4170
02:35:40,798 --> 02:35:42,815
Yeah, I heard of burning slips.

4171
02:35:42,848 --> 02:35:44,615
It happens all the time.
I mean. I mean. I mean.

4172
02:35:44,615 --> 02:35:46,832
I mean, I might as well call using Freud
at this point.

4173
02:35:47,582 --> 02:35:49,299
Sir, chef, sir.

4174
02:35:49,299 --> 02:35:52,349
Lord, Master Chef, sir lord.

4175
02:35:53,033 --> 02:35:53,433
Oh, really?

4176
02:35:53,433 --> 02:35:55,950
Now, that's a real Freudian slip.
Holy shit. Fair enough.

4177
02:35:56,333 --> 02:35:57,033
I don't if.

4178
02:35:57,033 --> 02:35:58,917
We all get stuck here,
we can't even serve.

4179
02:35:58,917 --> 02:36:00,300
Yeah, we can't serve.

4180
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:03,817
We're stuck on one side,
which is very chill.

4181
02:36:03,967 --> 02:36:06,301
Just chill. We'll wait for it.

4182
02:36:07,384 --> 02:36:08,167
Yeah, I'll.

4183
02:36:08,167 --> 02:36:10,351
I'll also the rest of what we got.

4184
02:36:10,351 --> 02:36:12,785
OK, ok, I'll wait. We need plates.

4185
02:36:12,935 --> 02:36:15,352
Dirty place. There's dirty places.
Dirty plates.

4186
02:36:15,352 --> 02:36:16,352
Yeah, just.

4187
02:36:16,352 --> 02:36:19,085
Just put it here. Just put it here.
I'll clean them up. Yeah.

4188
02:36:19,085 --> 02:36:20,135
All done.

4189
02:36:21,936 --> 02:36:23,752
Oh, chopper to g.

4190
02:36:23,752 --> 02:36:24,936
Chopper to. Cheese.

4191
02:36:24,936 --> 02:36:27,753
Well,
I threw the cheese into the oblivion.

4192
02:36:27,753 --> 02:36:29,753
Did not mean to do that.

4193
02:36:29,753 --> 02:36:31,170
You did. OK, we just wait.

4194
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:33,087
We have three regular hamburgers.

4195
02:36:33,087 --> 02:36:33,803
What's

4196
02:36:36,804 --> 02:36:37,254
hold on.

4197
02:36:37,254 --> 02:36:37,987
OK, this one's ready.

4198
02:36:37,987 --> 02:36:38,904
This one's ready.

4199
02:36:38,904 --> 02:36:39,804
I think.

4200
02:36:41,371 --> 02:36:43,104
Yep. So that.

4201
02:36:43,104 --> 02:36:45,488
And that one is.

4202
02:36:45,488 --> 02:36:46,321
Wait, wait, wait.

4203
02:36:46,321 --> 02:36:48,755
You know, the plates are fake. Why?
We can't get the meat.

4204
02:36:48,838 --> 02:36:50,338
Oh, my God, we're stuck.

4205
02:36:50,338 --> 02:36:52,388
Wait, can you watch them from the side?
I think I can.

4206
02:36:52,589 --> 02:36:53,889
Yeah.

4207
02:36:53,889 --> 02:36:56,639
Oh, it makes zero sense,
but I don't give a shit.

4208
02:36:56,972 --> 02:36:57,722
OK, ok.

4209
02:36:57,722 --> 02:36:58,922
OK. And

4210
02:37:02,006 --> 02:37:03,506
I just need a plate for that.

4211
02:37:03,506 --> 02:37:04,673
I mean, so plates already.

4212
02:37:04,673 --> 02:37:06,423
You plates are ready.

4213
02:37:06,623 --> 02:37:09,207
All right. Oh, ok. I'll grab more meat.

4214
02:37:09,207 --> 02:37:10,207
We need more meat.

4215
02:37:10,207 --> 02:37:11,924
Yeah, that's it.

4216
02:37:11,924 --> 02:37:13,657
Yeah, I'll throw that.

4217
02:37:13,657 --> 02:37:14,757
Let me just add the right to me.

4218
02:37:15,924 --> 02:37:16,558
There you go.

4219
02:37:16,558 --> 02:37:17,941
That's over there.

4220
02:37:18,058 --> 02:37:20,558
OK. Have

4221
02:37:20,558 --> 02:37:21,658
I have it back. I have it back.

4222
02:37:21,658 --> 02:37:22,108
You've earned it.

4223
02:37:22,108 --> 02:37:23,858
You've earned some raw meat.

4224
02:37:25,858 --> 02:37:27,775
This is good.

4225
02:37:30,092 --> 02:37:30,309
Yeah.

4226
02:37:30,309 --> 02:37:32,492
It's just a bunch of regular burgers.

4227
02:37:32,492 --> 02:37:33,726
No cheese.

4228
02:37:33,726 --> 02:37:36,476
No, she's not. She's OK.

4229
02:37:36,476 --> 02:37:37,643
And again, we're on different sides.

4230
02:37:37,643 --> 02:37:38,493
It's good

4231
02:37:42,927 --> 02:37:43,944
oh, ok. OK.

4232
02:37:43,944 --> 02:37:45,627
This one's running. This one's ready.
This one's ready.

4233
02:37:45,627 --> 02:37:47,694
OK, there you go. Take it,
take it, take it, take it.

4234
02:37:47,827 --> 02:37:48,544
Take it.

4235
02:37:48,811 --> 02:37:51,628
And it's got

4236
02:37:53,078 --> 02:37:53,461
the chopped.

4237
02:37:53,461 --> 02:37:54,495
More meats.

4238
02:37:54,495 --> 02:37:56,678
Oh, look at that.

4239
02:37:56,678 --> 02:37:58,045
See work you there, baby?

4240
02:37:58,045 --> 02:37:58,645
Baby.

4241
02:38:01,029 --> 02:38:01,795
Here you go.

4242
02:38:01,795 --> 02:38:03,629
More plates are getting ready.

4243
02:38:03,629 --> 02:38:05,996
I think we have two cheeses next

4244
02:38:09,663 --> 02:38:10,146
to cheese.

4245
02:38:10,146 --> 02:38:12,063
Confirm some cheese.

4246
02:38:12,063 --> 02:38:13,796
Yeah, I got you.

4247
02:38:14,547 --> 02:38:15,547
Can I throw it?

4248
02:38:15,547 --> 02:38:16,497
I can

4249
02:38:18,147 --> 02:38:20,097
and there's a plate
here for some goddamn reason,

4250
02:38:21,881 --> 02:38:23,664
I can drop it here.

4251
02:38:23,664 --> 02:38:24,748
She has a cheeseburger.

4252
02:38:24,748 --> 02:38:26,314
Yeah, that one's ready. Helen's ready.

4253
02:38:26,314 --> 02:38:28,265
He's gonna.

4254
02:38:28,265 --> 02:38:30,665
Put a.

4255
02:38:30,848 --> 02:38:31,548
Black.

4256
02:38:31,865 --> 02:38:32,732
We'll put this in.

4257
02:38:32,732 --> 02:38:33,565
Put this in off.

4258
02:38:33,565 --> 02:38:35,765
Oh, God. Oh, wait. How that happened?

4259
02:38:36,415 --> 02:38:38,699
All right, well,
I guess we're on the opposite side now.

4260
02:38:38,699 --> 02:38:39,982
Yeah, ok.

4261
02:38:39,982 --> 02:38:43,383
OK. Well, damn it.

4262
02:38:43,383 --> 02:38:44,016
Plates up, plates up.

4263
02:38:44,016 --> 02:38:44,549
Come on.

4264
02:38:47,933 --> 02:38:49,867
I'm dropping me.

4265
02:38:49,867 --> 02:38:50,550
Oh, God.

4266
02:38:50,550 --> 02:38:52,984
OK, I want that burgers ready to get

4267
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:56,484
cooked so long. I put this on.

4268
02:38:56,484 --> 02:39:00,234
They go get to go on the dirty plates.

4269
02:39:01,134 --> 02:39:03,235
The chops, cheese again.

4270
02:39:04,085 --> 02:39:05,702
It's a regular burger.
It's about to expire.

4271
02:39:05,702 --> 02:39:07,502
Do a cheeseburger next.

4272
02:39:08,852 --> 02:39:09,752
OK, cheeseburger next.

4273
02:39:09,752 --> 02:39:11,969
Cheeseburger next. It's ready. It's right.

4274
02:39:11,969 --> 02:39:13,986
Yeah, it.

4275
02:39:13,986 --> 02:39:14,702
Good boy.

4276
02:39:16,403 --> 02:39:18,069
Is that OK? Yeah, I got that.

4277
02:39:18,069 --> 02:39:19,836
I don't want you eating. Plate.

4278
02:39:19,836 --> 02:39:22,920
Oh, plate. Play, play, play.

4279
02:39:22,987 --> 02:39:25,553
I didn't. I can't see them
from this angle. I thought it would lend

4280
02:39:27,570 --> 02:39:29,254
you know, I think we still got it, and we.

4281
02:39:29,254 --> 02:39:31,554
I think we still it. He's not bad.

4282
02:39:31,554 --> 02:39:32,404
Oh, my God.

4283
02:39:32,404 --> 02:39:34,854
Really? 740 now we can do it.

4284
02:39:34,854 --> 02:39:37,988
We can go in a bunch of mistakes that. He

4285
02:39:39,838 --> 02:39:41,555
we can be close.

4286
02:39:41,555 --> 02:39:42,955
Yeah, we could do that.

4287
02:39:42,955 --> 02:39:45,639
Yeah, maybe we could do that.

4288
02:39:46,322 --> 02:39:48,322
Customers are so impatient though.

4289
02:39:48,322 --> 02:39:48,906
Slowly.

4290
02:39:49,106 --> 02:39:51,423
They want their food
in, like, seconds flat.

4291
02:39:51,573 --> 02:39:52,956
OK, so we just got to finish this
one of them.

4292
02:39:52,956 --> 02:39:54,723
We can go back. Nice.

4293
02:39:54,723 --> 02:39:55,323
Yeah.

4294
02:39:55,323 --> 02:39:57,923
And talk to doctor old crusty onion. Boy

4295
02:40:00,657 --> 02:40:02,524
bring big

4296
02:40:03,057 --> 02:40:03,774
thing.

4297
02:40:05,657 --> 02:40:07,741
It's not that there is something
about tomatoes.

4298
02:40:08,208 --> 02:40:09,991
You anything about tomato?

4299
02:40:09,991 --> 02:40:10,325
Probably.

4300
02:40:10,325 --> 02:40:13,658
Just, like, later on, we'll have to do
with tomatoes as well. OK,

4301
02:40:18,342 --> 02:40:19,675
there are quite a lot of ingredients.

4302
02:40:19,675 --> 02:40:21,309
They're on me, sir. Thank you.

4303
02:40:25,543 --> 02:40:27,593
Go. You go.

4304
02:40:27,593 --> 02:40:29,693
That's right. You picked up.

4305
02:40:30,293 --> 02:40:31,827
OK, how. About we just you.

4306
02:40:31,827 --> 02:40:34,277
Get ready. How about we just get ready?

4307
02:40:34,277 --> 02:40:35,544
Yeah. And stuff here.

4308
02:40:35,544 --> 02:40:37,744
Regular burgers, 22 cheeseburgers.

4309
02:40:42,211 --> 02:40:42,778
You know?

4310
02:40:42,778 --> 02:40:45,295
Yeah. Hold on. You just.

4311
02:40:45,295 --> 02:40:47,495
I'm going to get I'm
just going to put the plate down here.

4312
02:40:47,728 --> 02:40:50,745
Get it ready ahead of time.

4313
02:40:53,079 --> 02:40:54,896
And to a regular burger.

4314
02:40:54,896 --> 02:40:55,612
You said it.

4315
02:40:55,612 --> 02:40:59,196
So here's a cheeseburger right here.

4316
02:40:59,196 --> 02:41:00,213
Regular lines.

4317
02:41:00,213 --> 02:41:02,513
And this is a regular burger place.

4318
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:07,047
I saw the voice,
and I just long it into a into oblivion.

4319
02:41:07,413 --> 02:41:08,580
First place to pick it up.

4320
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:09,564
You want.

4321
02:41:09,564 --> 02:41:12,781
I'm trying to put the plates down, you
whore.

4322
02:41:12,847 --> 02:41:14,197
No, no, no. I'm talking to you.
I'm talking to the game.

4323
02:41:14,197 --> 02:41:15,448
All the moves, OK?

4324
02:41:15,448 --> 02:41:17,281
I didn't mean
to call you a whore then. OK?

4325
02:41:18,898 --> 02:41:19,565
I know

4326
02:41:22,832 --> 02:41:23,832
stuff.

4327
02:41:25,082 --> 02:41:26,399
That's all this other stuff.

4328
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:27,549
I mean, stop throwing stuff.

4329
02:41:27,549 --> 02:41:30,116
Why are you throwing the shredded cheese
back at me?

4330
02:41:30,116 --> 02:41:32,399
Know it's kind of
just kind of why I'm out.

4331
02:41:32,966 --> 02:41:34,583
OK, ok,
let me. I'm going to send the burgers in.

4332
02:41:34,583 --> 02:41:35,916
And this one, the burgers.
And are you ready?

4333
02:41:35,916 --> 02:41:36,750
Are you ready?

4334
02:41:37,583 --> 02:41:39,117
OK, let's go. Let's go.

4335
02:41:39,117 --> 02:41:40,267
Easy peasy.

4336
02:41:43,884 --> 02:41:44,484
Oh, my God.

4337
02:41:44,484 --> 02:41:45,101
Gaming.

4338
02:41:45,151 --> 02:41:46,051
Gaming.

4339
02:41:48,968 --> 02:41:49,684
Is quite awkward.

4340
02:41:49,684 --> 02:41:50,818
Were stranded

4341
02:41:52,418 --> 02:41:53,551
oh. Well, while he's.

4342
02:41:53,551 --> 02:41:55,918
We have three plates of clean and ready
that real quick.

4343
02:41:55,918 --> 02:41:58,135
I'll go on the opposite side.

4344
02:41:58,502 --> 02:41:59,219
It's shaking.

4345
02:41:59,219 --> 02:42:00,602
All right, here we go.

4346
02:42:02,669 --> 02:42:03,086
Oh, yeah.

4347
02:42:03,086 --> 02:42:04,852
Well, it doesn't.

4348
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:10,053
Let me break.

4349
02:42:10,053 --> 02:42:10,886
I got.

4350
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:13,103
I got it. I got. It.
I thought I was yelling at the guy.

4351
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:14,753
Yeah, yeah, I saw. I saw

4352
02:42:16,404 --> 02:42:18,570
there's a bunch of a

4353
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:21,154
bunch of shit in the way.

4354
02:42:21,204 --> 02:42:24,154
We have three regular burgers actually on.

4355
02:42:24,838 --> 02:42:28,921
I'm going to send this one out
pre-emptively, but I got regular burgers.

4356
02:42:29,772 --> 02:42:31,688
Yeah. All right. Good side. Good side.

4357
02:42:31,688 --> 02:42:32,905
It splits. OK, it's.

4358
02:42:32,905 --> 02:42:35,005
Not good split, so I just need bread.

4359
02:42:35,005 --> 02:42:37,056
I just need bread with that one.

4360
02:42:37,706 --> 02:42:38,522
Bread right. One.

4361
02:42:38,522 --> 02:42:40,356
Yeah, that's bread with this one is bread.

4362
02:42:40,356 --> 02:42:42,723
I'll send it out as soon as you put
plate it.

4363
02:42:42,723 --> 02:42:44,190
What? What, what?

4364
02:42:44,190 --> 02:42:45,273
I was confused.

4365
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:48,357
OK, ok.

4366
02:42:48,357 --> 02:42:49,323
More regular, more. Right.

4367
02:42:49,323 --> 02:42:50,307
Here's more dirty dishes.

4368
02:42:50,307 --> 02:42:52,357
There's murder dishes. I mean, don't
let me do them.

4369
02:42:52,357 --> 02:42:53,107
All right? I'll stay on this side.

4370
02:42:53,107 --> 02:42:54,924
This this is Philip on my speed.

4371
02:42:54,924 --> 02:42:56,491
I'll stay on the side. Yeah.

4372
02:42:57,541 --> 02:42:59,741
Ok. You can grab the plate
whenever you're ready.

4373
02:42:59,774 --> 02:43:01,508
We just like. Yeah.

4374
02:43:01,508 --> 02:43:03,692
Thank you. All right.

4375
02:43:03,692 --> 02:43:06,358
OK, I'll chop more meats right here.

4376
02:43:07,325 --> 02:43:08,909
So we're not even toasting.

4377
02:43:08,909 --> 02:43:10,859
This is pretty wack.

4378
02:43:10,859 --> 02:43:11,792
Oh, I didn't mean to throw that.

4379
02:43:11,792 --> 02:43:12,442
She's

4380
02:43:14,093 --> 02:43:16,443
forgive me, chef.

4381
02:43:16,976 --> 02:43:17,393
Oh, nice.

4382
02:43:17,393 --> 02:43:17,693
You got it.

4383
02:43:17,693 --> 02:43:18,776
But you got it this time.

4384
02:43:18,776 --> 02:43:19,743
Finally.

4385
02:43:22,293 --> 02:43:23,944
OK, she's ready.

4386
02:43:23,944 --> 02:43:25,927
Eric mean for you?

4387
02:43:25,927 --> 02:43:27,444
I mean, you see on the other side.
See on the other side.

4388
02:43:27,444 --> 02:43:28,044
Stay on the other side.

4389
02:43:28,044 --> 02:43:30,644
Yeah, yeah. OK.

4390
02:43:31,711 --> 02:43:33,661
You OK to radio?

4391
02:43:33,661 --> 02:43:36,145
Nice. On in another burg.

4392
02:43:36,878 --> 02:43:38,945
Send some meat over. I can chop that.

4393
02:43:39,578 --> 02:43:41,729
How would you feel about this game
if they would just like randomly?

4394
02:43:41,729 --> 02:43:44,096
86 certain meals like that.
You just got to send it back.

4395
02:43:44,096 --> 02:43:46,612
It's like they said it was dry
and then you don't get the points for it.

4396
02:43:47,096 --> 02:43:49,146
That's fucked up.

4397
02:43:49,146 --> 02:43:49,713
I don't know.

4398
02:43:49,713 --> 02:43:52,230
I don't I think I would mauled. Or that

4399
02:43:53,463 --> 02:43:55,147
I think that's bullshit.

4400
02:43:56,947 --> 02:43:59,614
86. My meal is
just because it was too dry.

4401
02:44:00,547 --> 02:44:02,047
I'll show you dry.

4402
02:44:02,047 --> 02:44:03,114
Jesus.

4403
02:44:03,331 --> 02:44:06,264
God. You know, bite the pillow oh.

4404
02:44:07,264 --> 02:44:09,598
Thank you for the cheese, babe.

4405
02:44:10,081 --> 02:44:11,515
You're welcome.

4406
02:44:14,215 --> 02:44:16,049
Why are you throwing the buttons at me?

4407
02:44:16,049 --> 02:44:18,149
OK, I'm not at all. I'm losing it.

4408
02:44:18,899 --> 02:44:21,366
Like losing my mind in it.

4409
02:44:24,816 --> 02:44:25,683
You. Oh, no.

4410
02:44:25,683 --> 02:44:26,516
Oh, no. Oh, no.

4411
02:44:26,516 --> 02:44:27,933
Oh, no, you're not.

4412
02:44:27,933 --> 02:44:30,767
Oh, no. We're trying
not to have anything wrong.

4413
02:44:30,783 --> 02:44:32,134
There's no. It's OK. It's ok.

4414
02:44:32,134 --> 02:44:34,884
We can prepare so much together over here.

4415
02:44:36,067 --> 02:44:38,884
You can't even access one of the top moves

4416
02:44:40,234 --> 02:44:42,768
mm hmm.

4417
02:44:43,618 --> 02:44:46,335
But there

4418
02:44:46,585 --> 02:44:47,118
you go.

4419
02:44:47,118 --> 02:44:49,769
That's a burger. Ready not really.

4420
02:44:49,835 --> 02:44:51,269
Burger ready.

4421
02:44:53,502 --> 02:44:55,286
I'll grab that. Oh.

4422
02:44:55,286 --> 02:44:56,519
I put the.

4423
02:44:56,519 --> 02:44:57,153
I got it.

4424
02:44:57,153 --> 02:44:57,986
Yeah, I got it.

4425
02:44:57,986 --> 02:45:00,486
I put the fucking fire
extinguisher there for some reason.

4426
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:01,686
OK, is this ready?

4427
02:45:01,686 --> 02:45:03,787
Yeah, this is ready.
Let's go. Dirty dishes.

4428
02:45:03,787 --> 02:45:06,070
Dirty dishes. Are regular boring burger.

4429
02:45:06,187 --> 02:45:07,854
Regular burgers coming all man.

4430
02:45:09,604 --> 02:45:10,287
We could get another one.

4431
02:45:10,287 --> 02:45:12,754
We could get another one.
We need the dirty dishes. Three dishes.

4432
02:45:12,904 --> 02:45:14,854
Yeah. 24 seconds.

4433
02:45:14,854 --> 02:45:17,071
Just gets you. Regular burgers
to regular burgers. Ready?

4434
02:45:17,188 --> 02:45:18,455
I think we can have time for that.

4435
02:45:18,455 --> 02:45:19,105
Yeah,

4436
02:45:20,855 --> 02:45:22,588
I just need a place where it.

4437
02:45:22,989 --> 02:45:23,589
Any place.

4438
02:45:23,589 --> 02:45:24,089
Any place.

4439
02:45:24,089 --> 02:45:26,372
Yeah. Please. Oh.

4440
02:45:27,389 --> 02:45:28,622
Oh, my fucking God.

4441
02:45:28,622 --> 02:45:30,906
No, oh. Ok.

4442
02:45:32,039 --> 02:45:33,540
Oh, look, can we. Can we go?

4443
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:35,490
No, no, no. Washes.

4444
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:37,757
Yeah. Oh, the dolphins.

4445
02:45:37,873 --> 02:45:39,924
Such a good strike points.

4446
02:45:40,357 --> 02:45:42,890
Four points. The way. Not really.

4447
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:44,624
What are you talking about?

4448
02:45:44,624 --> 02:45:46,808
Oh. Oh,

4449
02:45:48,024 --> 02:45:50,408
my. Oh, my.

4450
02:45:51,175 --> 02:45:53,608
Just because you got stuck
on the same side of

4451
02:45:57,009 --> 02:45:57,542
this way.

4452
02:45:57,542 --> 02:46:00,059
Smells like shit in here one more time.

4453
02:46:00,059 --> 02:46:01,292
Smells like shit in here.

4454
02:46:01,292 --> 02:46:04,176
What a pickle. It smells like.

4455
02:46:04,326 --> 02:46:05,843
Not about my room. It's
most fine in my room.

4456
02:46:05,843 --> 02:46:08,676
I was just thinking about, like,
just the process of being in the game

4457
02:46:08,676 --> 02:46:10,026
and having that happen. I was just.

4458
02:46:10,026 --> 02:46:10,977
I don't know my opinion on it.

4459
02:46:10,977 --> 02:46:12,877
I was like, it smells like shit, you know?

4460
02:46:12,877 --> 02:46:15,994
OK, you're
your brain. Is truly miraculous.

4461
02:46:15,994 --> 02:46:18,627
Fox Thank you. Thank you. Soto Thank you.

4462
02:46:19,144 --> 02:46:21,694
Drama. OK, you ready?

4463
02:46:21,694 --> 02:46:23,578
Prep.
We're going to prep everything again.

4464
02:46:24,778 --> 02:46:28,345
One word

4465
02:46:30,545 --> 02:46:32,129
allowing more meat.

4466
02:46:32,129 --> 02:46:34,412
More meat. Good. One moment when meat.

4467
02:46:35,096 --> 02:46:36,296
I am laying out the buttons.

4468
02:46:36,296 --> 02:46:39,029
Be patient. Boy.

4469
02:46:39,629 --> 02:46:40,529
This is unrealistic.

4470
02:46:40,529 --> 02:46:43,980
I feel like they would probably ask
for a bottomless burger

4471
02:46:43,980 --> 02:46:45,297
at some point.

4472
02:46:48,114 --> 02:46:49,164
OK, we really need.

4473
02:46:49,164 --> 02:46:50,847
We really need to imagine
if they had, like

4474
02:46:50,847 --> 02:46:52,114
I mentioned, you know, never new
go to war.

4475
02:46:52,114 --> 02:46:54,931
Have you played that. The god of war?

4476
02:46:54,931 --> 02:46:56,314
No, I haven't. Actually.

4477
02:46:56,314 --> 02:46:59,165
You know, I like the new game is all about
what's kind of new.

4478
02:46:59,731 --> 02:47:02,815
Like, the newest one is about,
like, Kratos taking his, like,

4479
02:47:02,915 --> 02:47:04,448
this son boy up a mountain.

4480
02:47:04,448 --> 02:47:06,865
He's like, boy, you must not hunt
and all that kind of stuff.

4481
02:47:07,215 --> 02:47:08,099
You do that with us.

4482
02:47:08,099 --> 02:47:10,199
You know, I'm creatures
and you like the boy.

4483
02:47:10,199 --> 02:47:11,633
And the boy.

4484
02:47:11,633 --> 02:47:13,716
Boy and boy.

4485
02:47:13,716 --> 02:47:15,083
I'm just a boy.

4486
02:47:15,083 --> 02:47:17,933
Boy do you have much to learn, boy?

4487
02:47:18,633 --> 02:47:21,717
OK, let's chop more meat and cheese.

4488
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:24,450
Chop more meat, and she's cheese.
Get that ready.

4489
02:47:24,450 --> 02:47:26,467
Yeah. OK. I call it. Do I call you?

4490
02:47:26,467 --> 02:47:29,551
Was he say,
do I call you dad or do I call you mother?

4491
02:47:29,734 --> 02:47:30,968
Father, father?

4492
02:47:32,468 --> 02:47:33,835
Yeah, I'll do that.

4493
02:47:33,835 --> 02:47:34,918
My father.

4494
02:47:34,918 --> 02:47:37,052
Makes good. How to prepare a father.

4495
02:47:37,235 --> 02:47:38,285
Father and brother.

4496
02:47:38,285 --> 02:47:39,669
Father, father.

4497
02:47:39,669 --> 02:47:41,819
Father. Father. Father,

4498
02:47:43,019 --> 02:47:43,386
father. You.

4499
02:47:43,386 --> 02:47:44,219
Do you have a step?

4500
02:47:44,219 --> 02:47:45,152
Father? You're right.

4501
02:47:45,152 --> 02:47:47,369
Father. Father, I'm such father of fuck.

4502
02:47:47,586 --> 02:47:50,136
OK, ok. You give me the cheese.
Father, do.

4503
02:47:50,136 --> 02:47:52,170
Not make an I'm stuck step father joke.

4504
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,603
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4505
02:47:54,803 --> 02:47:55,887
You should not.

4506
02:47:55,954 --> 02:47:57,987
I was actually. About to get stuck.

4507
02:47:57,987 --> 02:47:58,954
Minimum.

4508
02:47:58,954 --> 02:48:00,604
No, no, no, no, no.

4509
02:48:02,221 --> 02:48:02,788
OK, meat.

4510
02:48:02,788 --> 02:48:05,071
We need all the plate meats.

4511
02:48:05,071 --> 02:48:05,738
Meat business.

4512
02:48:05,738 --> 02:48:08,171
And again,
I send this in and get ready. Ship

4513
02:48:12,688 --> 02:48:14,322
OK, this meat's ready.

4514
02:48:14,322 --> 02:48:16,456
This and then another one.

4515
02:48:17,072 --> 02:48:17,639
Action.

4516
02:48:17,972 --> 02:48:19,923
Oh, there you go. That's cooking.

4517
02:48:19,923 --> 02:48:21,123
Oh, you throw it in.

4518
02:48:21,123 --> 02:48:23,723
Yeah. Body of the.

4519
02:48:23,723 --> 02:48:24,690
Baby.

4520
02:48:24,873 --> 02:48:27,157
He come, baby. Wow.

4521
02:48:28,173 --> 02:48:29,457
I was already done that before.

4522
02:48:29,457 --> 02:48:31,174
Like I've heard, babe.

4523
02:48:31,174 --> 02:48:32,957
I've never heard baby.

4524
02:48:33,991 --> 02:48:35,041
We go.

4525
02:48:35,041 --> 02:48:37,974
I got it saved.

4526
02:48:38,491 --> 02:48:39,541
So I'm good on.

4527
02:48:39,541 --> 02:48:41,158
Yeah, it's good to go.

4528
02:48:41,158 --> 02:48:43,358
Good to go. All right,
let me get those dishes for you.

4529
02:48:43,358 --> 02:48:43,958
Yeah.

4530
02:48:45,025 --> 02:48:47,592
Sure. Oh.

4531
02:48:50,376 --> 02:48:50,859
I got that.

4532
02:48:50,859 --> 02:48:52,326
I got that. Don't worry, don't worry.

4533
02:48:52,326 --> 02:48:54,243
Oh, you got it. OK.

4534
02:48:54,243 --> 02:48:56,343
Oh, you're sexy when you catch it inside.

4535
02:48:56,793 --> 02:48:58,410
Are we only a plane

4536
02:49:00,176 --> 02:49:02,093
the sensory dish is right over here.

4537
02:49:02,093 --> 02:49:06,060
I got that she.

4538
02:49:06,660 --> 02:49:07,661
Looks. Already right.

4539
02:49:07,661 --> 02:49:09,927
We're looking good. Look at us, girl.
Look at us.

4540
02:49:10,111 --> 02:49:11,428
Who would have thought

4541
02:49:14,978 --> 02:49:15,328
the place?

4542
02:49:15,328 --> 02:49:17,395
Ready to thank you?

4543
02:49:17,828 --> 02:49:19,978
Look, all synergy.

4544
02:49:25,079 --> 02:49:27,663
Can't do anything like that.

4545
02:49:28,313 --> 02:49:29,963
Can do with that. It just needs a bun.

4546
02:49:29,963 --> 02:49:31,896
That just needs a bun. Now.

4547
02:49:31,896 --> 02:49:32,613
That's all right.

4548
02:49:32,613 --> 02:49:34,897
It's about to move my
thanks to make sure you know what.

4549
02:49:34,897 --> 02:49:36,863
I'm saying on the side. I understand,
but don't do it.

4550
02:49:36,863 --> 02:49:37,980
Put a dirty dish right there.

4551
02:49:39,114 --> 02:49:41,331
Oh, ok.

4552
02:49:41,447 --> 02:49:43,114
OK, ok, ok.

4553
02:49:43,114 --> 02:49:44,948
Oh, my God. I almost got stuck.

4554
02:49:44,948 --> 02:49:46,864
Came on time. Good job.

4555
02:49:47,198 --> 02:49:49,531
I did. Come on, time.
I always come on time.

4556
02:49:49,531 --> 02:49:50,965
I always come.

4557
02:49:51,181 --> 02:49:53,348
As William often says, right off his line.

4558
02:49:53,515 --> 02:49:56,782
I always come close enough. It's close.

4559
02:49:56,815 --> 02:50:00,666
I always come on your back.

4560
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:02,483
Who's back.

4561
02:50:03,833 --> 02:50:04,866
With you in.

4562
02:50:08,066 --> 02:50:09,683
All these games?

4563
02:50:12,367 --> 02:50:15,601
So don't play the Potter Fishy Moe
when our son

4564
02:50:15,601 --> 02:50:17,934
when you said that it's pretty bad.

4565
02:50:17,934 --> 02:50:19,084
There it is.

4566
02:50:21,534 --> 02:50:22,835
Look at our teamwork.

4567
02:50:22,835 --> 02:50:25,502
Tossing it back and forth. On this thing.

4568
02:50:25,502 --> 02:50:26,652
Oh, no, I OK.

4569
02:50:26,652 --> 02:50:27,185
I fucked it up.

4570
02:50:27,185 --> 02:50:28,202
I fucked it up.

4571
02:50:30,219 --> 02:50:32,219
I think I need a regular burger this time.

4572
02:50:32,219 --> 02:50:33,269
Like no cheese.

02:50:33,269 --> 02:50:35,602

Put that in the dish over here.

4587
02:51:03,239 --> 02:51:05,039
Put on the fire.

4588
02:51:05,039 --> 02:51:07,656
Here's some shredded cheese. Like you.

02:51:08,306 --> 02:51:09,873

02:51:09,873 --> 02:51:12,623
I'm gonna grab the da da da burger.

4591
02:51:12,956 --> 02:51:16,673
Let's start cooking PA.

4592
02:51:17,073 --> 02:51:20,190
So I'm reading another the regular burger,
if possible.

4593
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:21,724
Dirty dishes. Here you go.

4594
02:51:21,724 --> 02:51:23,724
Three regular burgers in a row.

4595
02:51:23,724 --> 02:51:24,907
Oh, OK.

4596
02:51:24,907 --> 02:51:27,174
I don't know why threw that one. Good.

4597
02:51:27,574 --> 02:51:28,758
OK, yeah.

4598
02:51:28,758 --> 02:51:29,791
Oh, where's all the suspense?

4599
02:51:29,791 --> 02:51:30,875
Oh, here's one

4600
02:51:32,258 --> 02:51:34,108

4601
02:51:35,425 --> 02:51:36,275
it's gonna rotate.

4602
02:51:36,275 --> 02:51:38,275
It's going to rotate soon. Get rotating.

4603
02:51:38,275 --> 02:51:39,459
We got the stuff. We got this

4604
02:51:41,726 --> 02:51:42,326

4605
02:51:42,326 --> 02:51:44,459
Be ready to get this one right

4606
02:51:44,459 --> 02:51:45,209
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, she's.

4607
02:51:45,209 --> 02:51:46,026
No, she's not.

4608
02:51:46,026 --> 02:51:47,343
She's not. She's got it.

4609
02:51:47,343 --> 02:51:49,176
OK, it's in. It's in, it's in.

4610
02:51:49,176 --> 02:51:49,493
We've got it.

4611
02:51:49,493 --> 02:51:55,127
Now we just have to not fuck up oh.

4612
02:51:55,377 --> 02:51:57,377
We have enough
time. We're going to buy one more volume.

4613
02:51:57,377 --> 02:51:59,194
One more. Bun. When we're born.
When we're born. I think we could get it.

4614
02:51:59,194 --> 02:52:00,077
We can get it. Seven.

4615
02:52:00,077 --> 02:52:02,378
Yeah, yeah. We have time.
We have time. Five.

4616
02:52:02,378 --> 02:52:06,445
Four, three, two, one.

4617
02:52:06,445 --> 02:52:08,128
Oh, it's so close.

4618
02:52:08,128 --> 02:52:10,028
Oh, that's so close.

4619
02:52:10,028 --> 02:52:11,695
Well, we still did it

4620
02:52:12,779 --> 02:52:14,846
let's go even need it.

4621
02:52:14,846 --> 02:52:16,896
We don't even need that. Said we did it.

4622
02:52:17,612 --> 02:52:18,813
To we're so clean.

4623
02:52:18,813 --> 02:52:21,313
We get so. Good at. These. They're clean.

4624
02:52:21,863 --> 02:52:26,247
Oh, O'Keefe's shifty Chete.

4625
02:52:30,097 --> 02:52:32,814
Oh, that was a really good job.

4626
02:52:32,847 --> 02:52:34,264
You were sexy back there.

4627
02:52:34,264 --> 02:52:35,664
You handled that me real well.

4628
02:52:35,664 --> 02:52:37,081
Well, thank you, you guys.

4629
02:52:37,081 --> 02:52:38,965
I can back that yeah.

4630
02:52:38,965 --> 02:52:40,765
And the buns.

4631
02:52:41,098 --> 02:52:42,782
Very good bun work. Yeah, I think.

4632
02:52:42,782 --> 02:52:44,882
I think you were the handling,
the me and I was handling the buns.

4633
02:52:45,065 --> 02:52:46,682
Yeah, that's true.

4634
02:52:46,682 --> 02:52:48,366
Wait a second.

4635
02:52:48,866 --> 02:52:49,299
Wait a.

4636
02:52:49,299 --> 02:52:51,682
Second. I'm

4637
02:52:54,716 --> 02:52:55,583
not a jokester.

4638
02:52:55,583 --> 02:52:57,950
You're going to be a fucking comedian.

4639
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,667
I am very comedian.

4640
02:52:59,667 --> 02:53:02,334
He has a. Quest for us.

4641
02:53:02,334 --> 02:53:07,917
What's next on the hmm?

4642
02:53:09,401 --> 02:53:10,684
I though I.

4643
02:53:10,684 --> 02:53:12,068
Bring you. Chefs.

4644
02:53:12,068 --> 02:53:14,635
You're in one piece, Kevin.
I didn't think you'd make it.

4645
02:53:14,668 --> 02:53:16,352
Who's Kevin?

4646
02:53:16,385 --> 02:53:18,235
Dog? Oh, that's a dog.

4647
02:53:18,235 --> 02:53:21,002
His name's Kevin and all.

4648
02:53:21,785 --> 02:53:24,052
Is he. Is he, like, the ruler?

4649
02:53:24,452 --> 02:53:28,686
Oh, no, why
are you running all your own in Ryder?

4650
02:53:28,686 --> 02:53:31,653
You're qualified,
but look how your skills have grown.

4651
02:53:32,136 --> 02:53:32,820
It's not just.

4652
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:34,953
Your bowl,
your balloon that's on the up and up.

4653
02:53:35,437 --> 02:53:36,754
There's still much to do.

4654
02:53:36,754 --> 02:53:39,537
The umbrella, they're getting hungrier
with each passing moment.

4655
02:53:40,054 --> 02:53:41,371
Maybe the strange lions.

4656
02:53:41,371 --> 02:53:44,671
To the east will hold the secret
to moderating their munchies.

4657
02:53:45,188 --> 02:53:47,188
There are curious rumours about the place.

4658
02:53:47,488 --> 02:53:49,588
Many myths and legends.

4659
02:53:49,588 --> 02:53:51,638
Do you dare you do?

4660
02:53:51,638 --> 02:53:52,855
Oh, my guts.

4661
02:53:52,855 --> 02:53:54,122
Sick astronomers.

4662
02:53:54,122 --> 02:53:56,005
Well, make sure you stick together.

4663
02:53:56,005 --> 02:53:56,906
And remember.

4664
02:53:56,906 --> 02:53:58,772
Not everything is as it seems.

4665
02:53:58,772 --> 02:53:59,873
In the onion kingdom.

4666
02:54:01,206 --> 02:54:03,840
As everything
as it seems in the ultimate kingdom.

4667
02:54:04,623 --> 02:54:07,807
A dog, a doggy dog washing up.

4668
02:54:07,807 --> 02:54:08,940
Was that mean.

4669
02:54:10,290 --> 02:54:12,090
I'm talk to the dog.

4670
02:54:13,324 --> 02:54:15,357
Or wife in there.

4671
02:54:15,357 --> 02:54:19,474
So I keep I keep like
when I nudge my mike, it just goes really.

4672
02:54:19,508 --> 02:54:21,008
A little disloyal.

4673
02:54:21,008 --> 02:54:21,841
The jury deal.

4674
02:54:21,841 --> 02:54:22,375
Yeah.

4675
02:54:22,508 --> 02:54:23,942
Do you do. Want.

4676
02:54:25,442 --> 02:54:26,942
By the way, out of question one?

4677
02:54:26,942 --> 02:54:28,859
Do you want to stop?

4678
02:54:28,859 --> 02:54:30,842
I don't mind.

4679
02:54:30,842 --> 02:54:33,659
I imagine we probably can't play this game
for quite as long as it takes to

4680
02:54:33,659 --> 02:54:35,093
because it is really stressful.

4681
02:54:35,093 --> 02:54:36,443
So it it's up to you.

4682
02:54:36,443 --> 02:54:37,926
I don't mind personally. It's up to you.

4683
02:54:37,926 --> 02:54:40,076
OK, how about we do a couple more

4684
02:54:40,226 --> 02:54:43,227
a couple more into the new area
and then call it there.

4685
02:54:43,860 --> 02:54:44,310
As it's going to.

4686
02:54:45,477 --> 02:54:47,010
Because it takes to Israel.

4687
02:54:47,010 --> 02:54:50,227
It's it's someone in a way,
it gets relaxing up once

4688
02:54:50,311 --> 02:54:51,728
there's like it's like,
you know, it's it's.

4689
02:54:51,728 --> 02:54:54,778
A very emotional
and this is like this is just this is.

4690
02:54:54,778 --> 02:54:56,161
Just like stress. It keeps.

4691
02:54:56,161 --> 02:54:58,195
Getting more stressful via the second.

4692
02:54:58,628 --> 02:55:01,795
Real man
but all real dick in the arse butterball.

4693
02:55:01,795 --> 02:55:03,295
You know what I'm saying?

4694
02:55:04,596 --> 02:55:04,796
Yeah.

4695
02:55:04,796 --> 02:55:07,529
I mean, that's
why that's why we're lubricated. Mood.

4696
02:55:07,612 --> 02:55:08,946
What is it?

4697
02:55:08,946 --> 02:55:12,630
Stonehenge, it seems 820 points.

4698
02:55:14,847 --> 02:55:16,247
It looks really cool.

4699
02:55:16,247 --> 02:55:17,580
Like the design.

4700
02:55:17,580 --> 02:55:19,714
Yeah. Pizza.

4701
02:55:19,747 --> 02:55:20,814
It's up.

4702
02:55:20,814 --> 02:55:23,097
Well, you can. Order pizza after this.

4703
02:55:23,364 --> 02:55:24,848
I haven't had a good pizza in a bit.

4704
02:55:24,848 --> 02:55:26,814
You asked it. Oh, now.

4705
02:55:26,814 --> 02:55:27,881
I want to order pizza.

4706
02:55:27,881 --> 02:55:29,665
Ricardo with a knife. And you know what?

4707
02:55:29,665 --> 02:55:32,182
I actually kind of want to go out
and get pizza, like, go to a restaurant,

4708
02:55:32,198 --> 02:55:35,399
get restaurant pizza, all right,
let's figure out how we do this stuff.

4709
02:55:35,699 --> 02:55:37,199
Over here now.

4710
02:55:37,199 --> 02:55:38,349
And you're completely like.

4711
02:55:38,349 --> 02:55:40,582
Father, I'm stuck over here.

4712
02:55:40,582 --> 02:55:42,266
Help me out.

4713
02:55:42,266 --> 02:55:44,766
Boy, you must learn to deal with
imprisonment.

4714
02:55:44,933 --> 02:55:46,566
Boy, oh, boy.

4715
02:55:47,583 --> 02:55:48,600
Here you go.

4716
02:55:48,967 --> 02:55:49,917
All right, so one way.

4717
02:55:49,917 --> 02:55:52,017
So what do I do with the tomorrow? I think

4718
02:55:53,284 --> 02:55:55,617
all right, Dough.

4719
02:55:56,317 --> 02:55:56,584
I think.

4720
02:55:56,584 --> 02:55:59,034
I think you put the dough on the board.
Yeah. There you go. You got to.

4721
02:55:59,384 --> 02:56:02,701
One. Got to chop. It, though, for all.

4722
02:56:02,701 --> 02:56:03,418
You know what?

4723
02:56:03,418 --> 02:56:04,385
Here you go.

4724
02:56:04,385 --> 02:56:06,185
Yeah, yeah. There you go.

4725
02:56:06,185 --> 02:56:08,402
And then cheese.

4726
02:56:08,402 --> 02:56:09,969
Cheese boxes.

4727
02:56:09,969 --> 02:56:12,452
Wait, what's OK?

4728
02:56:12,936 --> 02:56:15,036
Yeah. Oh, no way.

4729
02:56:15,752 --> 02:56:17,253
It's it's pushing away. Why?

4730
02:56:17,253 --> 02:56:19,053
They're pushing you away for OK.

4731
02:56:19,053 --> 02:56:21,086
So we got to do with that,
then afterwards. No.

4732
02:56:23,153 --> 02:56:23,787
Oh, shit.

4733
02:56:23,787 --> 02:56:26,737

02:56:27,504 --> 02:56:29,137
Oh. Oh, it's going in the oven.

4736
02:56:29,137 --> 02:56:30,654

02:56:38,971 --> 02:56:39,705
OK, some.

4741
02:56:39,705 --> 02:56:40,622
Of you in chat.

4742
02:56:40,622 --> 02:56:43,589
You hope aspiring chefs
who want to make pizza.

4743
02:56:43,989 --> 02:56:44,939
This is just to let you know

4744
02:56:44,939 --> 02:56:48,606
you do not prepared
pizza dough by smacking it with a knife.

4745
02:56:48,689 --> 02:56:49,889
I got a loft over here.

4746
02:56:51,723 --> 02:56:53,223
I've never seen that before.

4747
02:56:53,223 --> 02:56:55,356
It was like a first fire
seeing someone chop. It's got a.

4748
02:56:55,356 --> 02:56:58,673
Few ready because it looks like the cheese
pizza is like one of the only recipes.

4749
02:57:00,690 --> 02:57:02,307
Are in Harry Potter.

4750
02:57:02,307 --> 02:57:03,607
Where the fuck are we?

4751
02:57:03,607 --> 02:57:05,007
The council's, like, discussing.

4752
02:57:05,007 --> 02:57:06,357
All right. Paul, I read.

Don't look at me.

4757
02:57:16,925 --> 02:57:17,575
Look at me.

4758
02:57:17,725 --> 02:57:19,475
Look at me every hour.

4759
02:57:19,475 --> 02:57:21,509
I go high grade.

4760
02:57:22,926 --> 02:57:23,792
You lost the plate.

4761
02:57:23,792 --> 02:57:25,626

02:57:30,727 --> 02:57:32,143
Harry. Potter is Eric.

4765
02:57:32,143 --> 02:57:35,677
You probably know what happened.

4766
02:57:35,677 --> 02:57:37,944
The place in the corner
now. You know it's OK.

4767
02:57:37,994 --> 02:57:39,927
We're not going somewhere where we got
plenty of time.

4768
02:57:39,927 --> 02:57:42,511
I'm where I send this. Oh, here you go.

Always fucking dead. Oh, my God. Wait.

4773
02:57:51,512 --> 02:57:51,962
Tony, um.

4774
02:57:51,962 --> 02:57:52,679

02:57:52,679 --> 02:57:55,379
Yeah, I got you.

You can you can put that order out now.

4780
02:58:02,763 --> 02:58:04,530
You got plates right out.

4781
02:58:04,530 --> 02:58:06,180
Plates, babe, let's begin

4782
02:58:09,847 --> 02:58:10,980
oh, we don't even get started.

4783
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:13,664
There gonna be breach

4784
02:58:14,714 --> 02:58:17,048
and they re all but oh, no, vokey,
not rebar.

4785
02:58:17,048 --> 02:58:19,415
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Something's happening to my brain.

4786
02:58:19,615 --> 02:58:20,548
No, no, it's OK.

4787
02:58:20,548 --> 02:58:20,981
I like I.

4788
02:58:20,981 --> 02:58:22,048
Like I'm feeling like.

4789
02:58:22,048 --> 02:58:24,448
I'm sure it's very it's very sexy.

4790
02:58:24,782 --> 02:58:26,049
You know, I said that to you.

4791
02:58:26,049 --> 02:58:28,315
It's very sexy
when you do those accents. I don't. Know.

4792
02:58:28,382 --> 02:58:29,049
Or, like.

4793
02:58:29,199 --> 02:58:29,949
I usually think.

4794
02:58:29,949 --> 02:58:32,266
Oh, you want me to use the hybrid accent?

4795
02:58:32,266 --> 02:58:33,933
Yeah, please.

4796
02:58:33,933 --> 02:58:37,283
We can talk to you like your Harry Potter.

4797
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:41,133
You call me Harry Potter again, ok? OK.

4798
02:58:41,133 --> 02:58:42,184
OK, let's calm down there.

4799
02:58:42,184 --> 02:58:45,384
Oh, all right, sir, I expect that one.

4800
02:58:46,801 --> 02:58:49,801
If we still can't get that pizza
that's down there.

4801
02:58:49,801 --> 02:58:51,451
This is our. It's on what.

4802
02:58:51,451 --> 02:58:53,635
It ok, plate by table. Here is the. Play.

4803
02:58:53,651 --> 02:58:54,301
I put the plate right there.

4804
02:58:54,301 --> 02:58:56,035
I put the boy
right there at the bottom of a.

4805
02:58:56,035 --> 02:58:57,302
Burger up above the book.

4806
02:58:58,285 --> 02:58:58,535
Page.

4807
02:58:58,535 --> 02:58:59,485
I'm ordering

4808
02:59:01,085 --> 02:59:03,002
data plate for that. You

4809
02:59:03,152 --> 02:59:04,886
graded off. OK,
if you find out, you idiot.

4810
02:59:04,886 --> 02:59:06,803
I can't grab it. Oh, no, I can't.

4811
02:59:06,803 --> 02:59:07,386
I can't grab it.

4812
02:59:07,386 --> 02:59:08,636
I can't grab it.

4813
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:11,436
Oh, shit.

4814
02:59:11,436 --> 02:59:12,203
What is this?

4815
02:59:12,203 --> 02:59:14,903
Justine, are we OK? Dad?

4816
02:59:14,903 --> 02:59:17,254
Dude,
there's a plate right here of a food.

4817
02:59:17,254 --> 02:59:19,704
It can grab. It can go out
and serve it to the customer.

4818
02:59:19,737 --> 02:59:23,104
Maybe I you a picture right now.

4819
02:59:23,888 --> 02:59:25,688
You know, I feel like I should.

4820
02:59:25,688 --> 02:59:27,421
I can actually stay
on the other side of you.

4821
02:59:27,421 --> 02:59:29,521
You don't have to be separated.

4822
02:59:29,788 --> 02:59:30,572
We just like that.

4823
02:59:30,572 --> 02:59:32,638
You know, it's a good shot.
Would you grab a bunch of these?

4824
02:59:32,672 --> 02:59:33,572
Oh, my God.

4825
02:59:33,572 --> 02:59:35,522
Big brain. Oh, no, no, no way. Well,
we can't that we can't.

4826
02:59:35,522 --> 02:59:37,389
So we can't. We can't. We can't. So

4827
02:59:38,372 --> 02:59:38,906
what do you mean?

4828
02:59:38,906 --> 02:59:39,956
Because that thing of, like,

4829
02:59:39,956 --> 02:59:42,606
if you're on this side, you can't go up
the up and down the stairs.

4830
02:59:43,406 --> 02:59:45,806
I can't. Yeah.

4831
02:59:45,806 --> 02:59:49,407
Oh, I think I recognise too much planning,
to be honest.

4832
02:59:50,607 --> 02:59:51,724
I like in concept.

4833
02:59:51,724 --> 02:59:52,974
Yes. But

4834
02:59:53,407 --> 02:59:55,157
I don't know if we have. OK.

4835
02:59:55,707 --> 02:59:58,674
Well you might not have the brain
part but.

4836
02:59:58,674 --> 03:00:00,241
I know
I think I'm just making an accurate.

4837
03:00:00,241 --> 03:00:02,408
Estimation of what
both of us together are capable of.

4838
03:00:02,875 --> 03:00:04,208
Yeah, you're right.

4839
03:00:08,975 --> 03:00:12,992
OK. All oh, we are with the customer cook.

4840
03:00:12,992 --> 03:00:13,792
I'm Patty.

4841
03:00:13,792 --> 03:00:16,476
No. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

4842
03:00:16,793 --> 03:00:17,276
Oh, shit.

4843
03:00:17,276 --> 03:00:19,893
Oh, crap. OK.

4844
03:00:21,477 --> 03:00:22,110
I'm crabbing.

4845
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:23,677
I'm squid game.

4846
03:00:23,677 --> 03:00:25,794
Squid game, crab game, crab game.

4847
03:00:27,661 --> 03:00:28,494
You ever watch that?

4848
03:00:28,494 --> 03:00:30,544
You ever watch the crab game.

4849
03:00:30,544 --> 03:00:32,844
I've watched the squid keep them.

4850
03:00:32,844 --> 03:00:35,278
It's I want to watch the rest of
it. I never got around to it.

4851
03:00:36,928 --> 03:00:39,995
Critical
thought and the cheese can go on this one.

4852
03:00:40,212 --> 03:00:42,579
Right? Yeah. Cheating on that.

4853
03:00:42,579 --> 03:00:44,129
And that's what.

4854
03:00:44,129 --> 03:00:46,996
Oh, Frank, the icon was in place and.

4855
03:00:47,929 --> 03:00:50,129
It's been pretty well. On the go.

4856
03:00:50,129 --> 03:00:52,413
We go. OK, put down a plate.

4857
03:00:53,213 --> 03:00:55,147
I don't have a plate.

4858
03:00:56,047 --> 03:00:58,280
There is a plate up to the plate.

4859
03:00:58,280 --> 03:01:01,480
Why was there no on the floor?

4860
03:01:01,497 --> 03:01:03,347
Because I don't take those kind of cake.

4861
03:01:03,347 --> 03:01:05,064
It's a little pressure

4862
03:01:06,331 --> 03:01:07,548
get off. OK.

4863
03:01:07,548 --> 03:01:09,348
Oh, oh, oh.

4864
03:01:09,348 --> 03:01:11,348
Yo, yo, yo.

4865
03:01:11,348 --> 03:01:13,832
We're watching our plate
washing our plate.

4866
03:01:13,832 --> 03:01:15,965
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

4867
03:01:15,965 --> 03:01:16,749
I got it.

4868
03:01:17,065 --> 03:01:19,149
I got it. I got it.

4869
03:01:19,149 --> 03:01:20,199
Pop. Another one for you.

4870
03:01:20,199 --> 03:01:20,549
Another one.

4871
03:01:20,549 --> 03:01:22,583
You can another monkey put in three.

4872
03:01:22,583 --> 03:01:24,416
I can put in there.

4873
03:01:24,416 --> 03:01:26,166
Yo, I put it in.

4874
03:01:26,166 --> 03:01:28,683
I don't know. I don't know.
I push it away.

4875
03:01:28,766 --> 03:01:30,933
I make sure we make sure we got a plate.

4876
03:01:31,283 --> 03:01:32,484
There's no plate. There's no plate.

4877
03:01:36,067 --> 03:01:37,617
No seventh day.

4878
03:01:37,617 --> 03:01:39,451
Was that enough. Was it 720.

4879
03:01:39,451 --> 03:01:41,468
Eight 2820.

4880
03:01:43,418 --> 03:01:44,768
We can do that chef. We can.

4881
03:01:44,768 --> 03:01:47,018
Oh go. We have to do it slowly. OK, maybe.

4882
03:01:47,068 --> 03:01:48,118
We can do that. Yeah.

4883
03:01:48,118 --> 03:01:48,685
Yeah we can do that.

4884
03:01:48,685 --> 03:01:50,335
Oh boy, oh, boy.

4885
03:01:50,335 --> 03:01:52,385
All right. All right. OK.

4886
03:01:53,169 --> 03:01:55,252
I see how it is. Oh.

4887
03:01:56,819 --> 03:01:57,569
We got you, dude.

4888
03:01:57,569 --> 03:02:00,636
Hill, what was I, new chef?

4889
03:02:01,386 --> 03:02:03,187
I wasn't even looking

4890
03:02:03,937 --> 03:02:04,803
All right, all right.

4891
03:02:04,803 --> 03:02:06,654
Here's how we do it, is that we go just.

4892
03:02:06,654 --> 03:02:07,920
I think we have it down.

4893
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:10,171
We just need to be a little bit quicker.

4894
03:02:10,171 --> 03:02:10,587
Yeah.

4895
03:02:11,004 --> 03:02:13,388
Boy, doh.

4896
03:02:14,854 --> 03:02:15,638
Cheese

4897
03:02:19,138 --> 03:02:20,738
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm hmm.

4898
03:02:20,738 --> 03:02:23,539
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Oh.

4899
03:02:23,539 --> 03:02:24,505
Fuck me.

4900
03:02:24,505 --> 03:02:25,955
Oh, what I did there

4901
03:02:28,406 --> 03:02:30,273
I legitimately think
we can be on the same.

4902
03:02:30,273 --> 03:02:32,406
We could be
on, like, the same side over there, right?

4903
03:02:32,723 --> 03:02:34,056
I don't know about I don't know about it.

4904
03:02:34,056 --> 03:02:38,673
Like, I, I agree
that it seems like it makes sense. But

4905
03:02:40,707 --> 03:02:41,257
like, let's try.

4906
03:02:41,257 --> 03:02:42,324
Let's try it.

4907
03:02:42,907 --> 03:02:43,124
Yeah.

4908
03:02:43,124 --> 03:02:45,024
It's not served just yet.

4909
03:02:45,024 --> 03:02:46,957
I'll come on over you.

4910
03:02:46,957 --> 03:02:49,058
Can you put the plate on my side?
I don't know.

4911
03:02:49,558 --> 03:02:51,608
They'll grab the plate sill

4912
03:02:54,475 --> 03:02:55,558
oh, fuck.

4913
03:02:56,008 --> 03:02:57,025
Oh, fuck.

4914
03:02:57,158 --> 03:02:57,542
Yeah.

4915
03:02:57,542 --> 03:02:59,525
So I think we just chop
a bunch of tomatoes.

4916
03:02:59,525 --> 03:03:02,076
I'll do that first, and then

4917
03:03:02,442 --> 03:03:04,076
just hoard it. Right?

4918
03:03:04,076 --> 03:03:06,776
Only the only real thing we can do
is jump tomatoes.

4919
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:12,993
Snap a bunch of these little dudes

4920
03:03:12,993 --> 03:03:14,394
and keep them in the corner.

4921
03:03:14,394 --> 03:03:16,527
They don't go bad, right? No.

4922
03:03:17,527 --> 03:03:18,727
I didn't mean do that.

4923
03:03:18,727 --> 03:03:20,394
Repair it go up

4924
03:03:20,877 --> 03:03:23,528
and show up oh,

4925
03:03:26,645 --> 03:03:27,778
look at that.

4926
03:03:27,962 --> 03:03:29,428
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

4927
03:03:29,428 --> 03:03:31,595
It could be big green. Yeah,
it could be Big Green.

4928
03:03:31,629 --> 03:03:34,929
Could be big green. Oh, I love

4929
03:03:36,662 --> 03:03:40,063
you. Look, all these fucking tomatoes did.

4930
03:03:42,363 --> 03:03:44,580
And here we go.

4931
03:03:44,730 --> 03:03:46,713
And then chop wood. Don't want that.

4932
03:03:46,713 --> 03:03:46,947
I do.

4933
03:03:46,947 --> 03:03:49,547
Lots of dough.
Dough is the important part, I think.

4934
03:03:49,547 --> 03:03:50,447
Yeah, just

4935
03:03:51,180 --> 03:03:53,347
a few moments later.

4936
03:03:53,347 --> 03:03:55,448
I'll go.

4937
03:03:55,448 --> 03:03:56,348
I'll sit up.

4938
03:03:56,398 --> 03:03:57,664
I'll sit up here.

4939
03:03:57,664 --> 03:03:58,348
The I think we need.

4940
03:03:58,348 --> 03:04:01,415
Yeah, well, we'll alternate between that

4941
03:04:04,898 --> 03:04:05,849
that's the one down

4942
03:04:05,849 --> 03:04:09,749
like thing we can't see was like get stuck

4943
03:04:12,483 --> 03:04:14,999
OK that's good to go.

4944
03:04:15,116 --> 03:04:17,366
I'll grab
doughnuts down here for some reason

4945
03:04:19,800 --> 03:04:22,500
and it's at the cheese tomato
that one needs tomato.

4946
03:04:23,967 --> 03:04:26,017
I'll put this in the oven though.

4947
03:04:27,901 --> 03:04:29,251
Oh, fuck. Me.

4948
03:04:29,251 --> 03:04:30,084
All right.

4949
03:04:31,168 --> 03:04:31,418
Then.

4950
03:04:31,418 --> 03:04:33,568
Don't threaten me with the good time.

4951
03:04:34,201 --> 03:04:37,268
It's not fox

4952
03:04:37,268 --> 03:04:39,118
I'm going to choke you.

4953
03:04:39,335 --> 03:04:40,635
Oh, are you all right?

4954
03:04:40,635 --> 03:04:41,235
All right.

4955
03:04:42,152 --> 03:04:42,635
All right, all right.

4956
03:04:42,635 --> 03:04:44,586
I can go for a bit. Spice with excitement.

4957
03:04:47,403 --> 03:04:48,503
Move out of the way.

4958
03:04:48,503 --> 03:04:50,753
Oh, my God. Your fat arse is in the way.

4959
03:04:50,753 --> 03:04:53,220
Sorry that my cake is disrupting you.

4960
03:04:53,853 --> 03:04:55,353
It is disrupting me.

4961
03:04:55,353 --> 03:04:57,620
I needs a plate.

4962
03:04:57,987 --> 03:04:59,637
My cake does not need to play God.

4963
03:04:59,637 --> 03:05:01,021
So needy.

4964
03:05:02,521 --> 03:05:03,304
All right?

4965
03:05:03,488 --> 03:05:05,138
I mean, I'm going.

4966
03:05:05,138 --> 03:05:05,754
To go over here.

4967
03:05:05,754 --> 03:05:07,888
I'm going to sit here,
and he's on the other side,

4968
03:05:08,288 --> 03:05:10,105
and I can transfer that directly.

4969
03:05:10,105 --> 03:05:11,555
To the plate. Who's going play? Yeah.

4970
03:05:11,555 --> 03:05:13,372
So there's cheese on that.

4971
03:05:13,372 --> 03:05:16,505
I'll drink.

4972
03:05:17,189 --> 03:05:18,722
I'm going to serve

4973
03:05:18,722 --> 03:05:21,206
the service to the customer
so they don't get pissy at me.

4974
03:05:22,123 --> 03:05:22,406
About.

4975
03:05:22,556 --> 03:05:24,423
Yeah, that needs to be cool.

4976
03:05:24,423 --> 03:05:26,273
A minute less shit

4977
03:05:27,957 --> 03:05:29,757
well, you got one minute left.

4978
03:05:29,757 --> 03:05:32,757
You doing. A transfer?

4979
03:05:32,757 --> 03:05:34,674
I was trying to clean the dirty plate.

4980
03:05:34,674 --> 03:05:35,424
I got eight.

4981
03:05:37,024 --> 03:05:37,808
I think this is working.

4982
03:05:37,808 --> 03:05:39,274
Back when I was Harry Potter.

4983
03:05:39,274 --> 03:05:41,575
All way suck

4984
03:05:44,492 --> 03:05:45,092
for some reason,

4985
03:05:45,092 --> 03:05:48,875
I couldn't clean it while that things were

4986
03:05:48,875 --> 03:05:49,525
costing.

4987
03:05:49,975 --> 03:05:52,376
OK, I'm serving, so I'm serving.

4988
03:05:52,559 --> 03:05:55,259
Serving it OK?

4989
03:05:55,426 --> 03:05:55,643
Yeah.

4990
03:05:55,859 --> 03:06:00,376
I mean, this way.

4991
03:06:00,676 --> 03:06:02,093
We did so much better last time.

4992
03:06:02,093 --> 03:06:02,993
What happened. Here?

4993
03:06:02,993 --> 03:06:03,693
Yeah.

4994
03:06:03,693 --> 03:06:06,427
We that will happen this time.

4995
03:06:06,727 --> 03:06:08,794
I'm confused.

4996
03:06:14,911 --> 03:06:15,278
Yeah,

4997
03:06:15,278 --> 03:06:19,645
we have like 700 last time way
and I feel like we struggled more last.

4998
03:06:19,678 --> 03:06:22,345
What we did because it was last night.

4999
03:06:22,495 --> 03:06:26,046
Maybe we put the pizza on too soon.

5000
03:06:28,796 --> 03:06:31,013
We put the pizza in as what we should do.

5001
03:06:31,013 --> 03:06:33,813
Let's make like 20
because all of the orders are the same.

5002
03:06:34,496 --> 03:06:35,397
Yeah, it's all the same.

5003
03:06:35,397 --> 03:06:37,530
Like 30 pizzas before we start the timer.

5004
03:06:38,397 --> 03:06:40,797
All you mean like
just put it on the floor.

5005
03:06:40,830 --> 03:06:41,497
All I see.

5006
03:06:41,497 --> 03:06:44,064
What you're talking about
and then we just clean plates entirely.

5007
03:06:44,097 --> 03:06:45,064
Yeah.

5008
03:06:45,064 --> 03:06:46,898
All right. All right.

5009
03:06:46,898 --> 03:06:47,314
See, that's.

5010
03:06:47,314 --> 03:06:48,748
How we game works.

5011
03:06:48,748 --> 03:06:50,348
This is how we gamed the system.

5012
03:06:50,348 --> 03:06:53,115
This is how we gain the advantage.

5013
03:06:53,115 --> 03:06:55,749
Also, I just finished all my team
this is so silent.

5014
03:06:56,049 --> 03:06:58,749
My man. My man just got 20 left.

5015
03:06:58,749 --> 03:06:59,666
How much time do you have?

5016
03:07:00,632 --> 03:07:02,633
I've got a big old, like,

5017
03:07:02,633 --> 03:07:05,133
at least, like, I'd like to joke
about the tea with a beard.

5018
03:07:05,166 --> 03:07:07,416
Jesus Christ is in the thermos. Do you?

5019
03:07:07,416 --> 03:07:09,900
How are you
all those people to have a thermos?

5020
03:07:10,467 --> 03:07:12,300
I do. Yeah, it's great. It's great.
I can do it.

5021
03:07:12,300 --> 03:07:14,317
I can do an endurance stream in my tea
will still be hot.

5022
03:07:14,317 --> 03:07:14,967
By the end.

5023
03:07:17,884 --> 03:07:21,034
But didn't you drink all the tea
like one time when we were like I did?

5024
03:07:21,034 --> 03:07:22,651
Yeah. During on third it takes to stream.

5025
03:07:22,651 --> 03:07:23,918
I drank that entire thing of tea.

5026
03:07:23,918 --> 03:07:25,051
It was pretty bad.

5027
03:07:26,402 --> 03:07:27,718
Pretty bad.

5028
03:07:27,968 --> 03:07:28,918
No, no, it was good tea.

5029
03:07:28,918 --> 03:07:31,202
That's why I drank it all about, like,
the fact that I drank the entire thing

5030
03:07:31,202 --> 03:07:32,585
in, like, 2 hours.
Probably not good for my

5031
03:07:37,536 --> 03:07:38,519
go. I

5032
03:07:38,519 --> 03:07:41,453
was going
to grab a bunch of tomatoes again.

5033
03:07:42,636 --> 03:07:45,653
But with the tomato over there, well. One.

5034
03:07:48,304 --> 03:07:48,687
Should remind me.

5035
03:07:48,687 --> 03:07:50,787
Thank you very much for the expert.
Thank you. Thank you.

5036
03:07:50,787 --> 03:07:51,387
I mean.

5037
03:07:52,137 --> 03:07:52,687
Don't

5038
03:07:53,521 --> 03:07:56,254
throw it at your face, apparently.

5039
03:07:56,254 --> 03:07:58,555
How Al

5040
03:07:58,555 --> 03:08:00,905
bruised tomato

5041
03:08:02,972 --> 03:08:04,705
bleep or the don't go

5042
03:08:09,056 --> 03:08:11,406
pug, pug, pug.

5043
03:08:11,406 --> 03:08:13,506
Take it out of the thing. Take it out.

5044
03:08:13,573 --> 03:08:14,273
Good boy.

5045
03:08:15,956 --> 03:08:18,157
I think I could just place it here.

5046
03:08:18,157 --> 03:08:21,924
I'm going to place these things on the
just taunt them with the

5047
03:08:22,024 --> 03:08:23,457
with the pizza

5048
03:08:27,474 --> 03:08:28,474
on the floor.

5049
03:08:28,474 --> 03:08:28,624
Yeah.

5050
03:08:28,624 --> 03:08:30,174
Floor pizza

5051
03:08:38,692 --> 03:08:41,376
and got all the cheese over
just throwing it over because like,

5052
03:08:41,559 --> 03:08:43,676
I know it's faster that way and

5053
03:08:47,159 --> 03:08:49,260
I'll go over on the other side

5054
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:52,760
so I can grab the oh,

5055
03:08:52,977 --> 03:08:54,293
plus. Is this OK?

5056
03:08:58,411 --> 03:09:00,961
Is this this fine fox?

5057
03:09:00,961 --> 03:09:01,828
No, it's fine. Yeah.

5058
03:09:01,828 --> 03:09:02,878
The time hasn't even started yet.

5059
03:09:02,878 --> 03:09:04,144
So we're chillin,

5060
03:09:04,928 --> 03:09:05,995
which

5061
03:09:11,078 --> 03:09:12,512
I got the zone.

5062
03:09:13,045 --> 03:09:15,512
OK, nice.

5063
03:09:15,512 --> 03:09:16,229
Good job.

5064
03:09:17,046 --> 03:09:18,413
Well, is this actually going to work?

5065
03:09:18,413 --> 03:09:22,380
We are so many pizzas
just stacked up up there.

5066
03:09:22,496 --> 03:09:25,880
Way they're not going cold. Oh,

5067
03:09:30,264 --> 03:09:31,514
it's ok.

5068
03:09:31,764 --> 03:09:33,564
It's OK. It's OK.

5069
03:09:33,564 --> 03:09:34,714
What's not cooked?

5070
03:09:34,714 --> 03:09:36,781
It's the pizza on the floor. It's
the pizza on the floor.

5071
03:09:36,781 --> 03:09:38,765
Oh, I took it out too early. Oops.

5072
03:09:38,765 --> 03:09:39,548
Thank you.

5073
03:09:40,981 --> 03:09:43,598
I'll yeah.

5074
03:09:43,682 --> 03:09:45,699
It was that you on the verge
of being cold? It was like two.

5075
03:09:45,699 --> 03:09:46,715
It was like two. Sends me away.

5076
03:09:46,715 --> 03:09:48,999
You ended it really bad.

5077
03:09:49,049 --> 03:09:49,532
I'm good at.

5078
03:09:49,532 --> 03:09:51,666
I walk, I say I'm good at edging.

5079
03:09:51,666 --> 03:09:53,849
And fast on the not my experience
but you know

5080
03:09:53,849 --> 03:09:55,766
as long as as long as you think I'm. OK.

5081
03:09:55,766 --> 03:09:57,366
Motherfucker, would you prefer me.

5082
03:09:59,967 --> 03:10:01,350
He my cheese.

5083
03:10:01,867 --> 03:10:04,234
To. Not like yeah,

5084
03:10:04,434 --> 03:10:08,334
I know exactly what you're thinking of
You are soul your soul.

5085
03:10:08,334 --> 03:10:11,418
Viva sly
along with your calling cocks and.

5086
03:10:11,434 --> 03:10:15,018
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

5087
03:10:15,035 --> 03:10:18,568
Oh, ha ha ha.

5088
03:10:19,919 --> 03:10:22,019
Oh. Bugs.

5089
03:10:22,385 --> 03:10:24,702
Oh. Sorry.

5090
03:10:25,702 --> 03:10:26,252
Sorry.

5091
03:10:26,252 --> 03:10:28,386
Shot all oh, you re sorry.

5092
03:10:28,386 --> 03:10:30,986
I know I you know, I don't worry about me.

5093
03:10:31,353 --> 03:10:32,886
You're fine. You're fine.

5094
03:10:32,886 --> 03:10:35,237
Oh, my God, you arsehole.

5095
03:10:35,587 --> 03:10:39,087
Pull this fucking all this fucking pizza
watch.

5096
03:10:39,420 --> 03:10:41,987
It's on the fuck.

5097
03:10:42,037 --> 03:10:44,188
Up, up, up. On the left one.

5098
03:10:45,238 --> 03:10:45,638
You got it.

5099
03:10:45,638 --> 03:10:46,138
I got it.

5100
03:10:46,138 --> 03:10:47,905
There's so floor if you'd stop.

5101
03:10:47,905 --> 03:10:50,488
All right. You reckon
we could just stop now?

5102
03:10:50,822 --> 03:10:52,738
Now let's let's.

5103
03:10:52,738 --> 03:10:53,972
Do a couple more.

5104
03:10:53,972 --> 03:10:55,105
Let's do a couple more.

5105
03:10:55,105 --> 03:10:55,739
Yeah.

5106
03:10:55,739 --> 03:10:58,022
Emotional damage.

5107
03:10:59,006 --> 03:11:00,873
There's some strategies on the floor
right there.

5108
03:11:00,873 --> 03:11:01,806
Just grab that

5109
03:11:02,756 --> 03:11:04,406
when you shift.

5110
03:11:04,406 --> 03:11:06,056
Oh, that's new strategy.

5111
03:11:06,056 --> 03:11:08,340
What do. I do?

5112
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:09,157
This is nuts.

5113
03:11:09,157 --> 03:11:10,323
Pick it out here.

5114
03:11:10,323 --> 03:11:11,124
It's OK.

5115
03:11:11,124 --> 03:11:13,590
This this is exactly how. Restaurants
do it.

5116
03:11:13,824 --> 03:11:15,991
I'm pretty sure. Yeah,

5117
03:11:16,074 --> 03:11:17,858
they're professionals, guys.

5118
03:11:17,858 --> 03:11:20,374
Not absolutely the most pro fashion
professionals.

5119
03:11:20,424 --> 03:11:23,725
They hired a dog in a sea turtle
to cook their food for them.

5120
03:11:23,725 --> 03:11:24,908
I think that's there on them.

5121
03:11:24,908 --> 03:11:25,975
If anything.

5122
03:11:25,975 --> 03:11:28,075
I thought for a second
I forgot who you're playing as.

5123
03:11:28,075 --> 03:11:30,192
I think you're talking about a real life
events. Like. No.

5124
03:11:30,242 --> 03:11:31,742
Yeah, yeah.

5125
03:11:31,742 --> 03:11:33,842
That was like a sea turtle who did, like,
all of this cooking.

5126
03:11:33,842 --> 03:11:34,476
It was incredible.

5127
03:11:34,476 --> 03:11:37,743
I was like, what OK.

5128
03:11:38,343 --> 03:11:40,143
So, you know, I think.

5129
03:11:40,143 --> 03:11:43,293
He's starting to see pizzas,
not so much pizzas.

5130
03:11:43,293 --> 03:11:47,860
We're like a Domino's right now, just
waiting to like, you know, express that.

5131
03:11:47,910 --> 03:11:48,927
How can I help you?

5132
03:11:48,927 --> 03:11:49,644
All right.

5133
03:11:49,644 --> 03:11:52,028
Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready.

5134
03:11:52,028 --> 03:11:52,828
Yeah. OK.

5135
03:11:52,828 --> 03:11:55,228
We got it. Like,
so it's all about cleaning the plates

5136
03:11:59,078 --> 03:12:01,779
oh. Oh,

5137
03:12:03,779 --> 03:12:07,012
oh, we were the plates.

5138
03:12:07,012 --> 03:12:07,746
Olivia we.

5139
03:12:07,746 --> 03:12:10,046
There's one plate down there.
Do you see that?

5140
03:12:10,046 --> 03:12:11,963
Yeah, I get there.

5141
03:12:11,963 --> 03:12:12,563
Yeah.

5142
03:12:17,847 --> 03:12:18,363
Hold on.

5143
03:12:18,363 --> 03:12:20,880
Let me grab this and clean it

5144
03:12:21,964 --> 03:12:23,164
I got cooked.

5145
03:12:23,164 --> 03:12:24,414
I got cocktails.

5146
03:12:24,414 --> 03:12:25,764
It's OK. I'll make. I'll just.

5147
03:12:25,764 --> 03:12:27,248
I'll just make another pizza.

5148
03:12:27,248 --> 03:12:28,748
In the meantime, there we go.

5149
03:12:28,748 --> 03:12:31,865
And I get the plates

5150
03:12:31,865 --> 03:12:32,915
so many missing plates.

5151
03:12:32,915 --> 03:12:36,382
When all the plates go where they put you.

5152
03:12:36,399 --> 03:12:38,949
I just threw some dough. You

5153
03:12:39,699 --> 03:12:42,216
now I the dough I you got me.

5154
03:12:45,599 --> 03:12:46,916
All the dude we have

5155
03:12:46,916 --> 03:12:50,283
for shredded cheese,
for dough or tomatoes,

5156
03:12:53,784 --> 03:12:54,017
good.

5157
03:12:54,584 --> 03:12:57,184
The job.
The job. You're doing great, babe.

5158
03:12:57,184 --> 03:12:57,984
I can't thank you.

5159
03:12:57,984 --> 03:13:00,484
Can only provide you support
as I'm stuck on the other side.

5160
03:13:02,634 --> 03:13:05,185
And we went through all the pizzas
already.

5161
03:13:05,185 --> 03:13:05,935
That's crazy. No,

5162
03:13:11,402 --> 03:13:12,002
odds.

5163
03:13:12,002 --> 03:13:14,036
You guys want to miss the.

5164
03:13:14,786 --> 03:13:16,352
This is insane.

5165
03:13:16,469 --> 03:13:18,636
This is such we we keep it.

5166
03:13:18,753 --> 03:13:20,986
Strategic, chefs. We.

5167
03:13:21,536 --> 03:13:22,203
You know, you know.

5168
03:13:22,203 --> 03:13:26,303
You know, this is like, dumb arse
like the virgin traditional chef,

5169
03:13:26,403 --> 03:13:28,170
which keeps food in a sanitary position.

5170
03:13:28,170 --> 03:13:31,254
So we just got to work smarter,
not harder.

5171
03:13:31,287 --> 03:13:34,771
The charred, efficient, overcooked
chef leaves 10,000

5172
03:13:34,771 --> 03:13:38,038
copies of the same food on the ground
until they have enough to.

5173
03:13:38,055 --> 03:13:40,588
So right in. Front of the customer to.

5174
03:13:40,588 --> 03:13:44,489
Shred cheese off the ground,
put on a fucking pizza Larry.

5175
03:13:44,589 --> 03:13:45,955
Right in front of them.

5176
03:13:45,955 --> 03:13:47,156
It is official.

5177
03:13:47,156 --> 03:13:49,439
It is efficient. Yeah.

5178
03:13:50,256 --> 03:13:52,106
And they're getting their food.

5179
03:13:54,773 --> 03:13:55,740
They're getting their food.

5180
03:13:55,740 --> 03:13:58,023
That's all the letters. On my screen.

5181
03:13:58,523 --> 03:14:00,057
Is spent on the screen.

5182
03:14:00,057 --> 03:14:02,140
Then I was, like, frothing for cocaine.

5183
03:14:02,140 --> 03:14:03,990
It's been. Like, spitting.

5184
03:14:03,990 --> 03:14:06,157
That's it.
That's disappointing. I looked at

5185
03:14:08,124 --> 03:14:09,024
I got locked in.

5186
03:14:09,024 --> 03:14:10,291
I got locked in.

5187
03:14:11,675 --> 03:14:12,908
I'll grab the pizza.

5188
03:14:12,908 --> 03:14:13,741
Pizza?

5189
03:14:13,808 --> 03:14:15,242
The pizza.

5190
03:14:16,525 --> 03:14:17,492
What are you expecting? Threes.

5191
03:14:17,492 --> 03:14:18,692
What do you expect, by the way?

5192
03:14:18,692 --> 03:14:21,576
I just want to ask, is there

5193
03:14:21,876 --> 03:14:23,426
is there is there a certain preference

5194
03:14:23,426 --> 03:14:26,076
to the spitting over swallowing.

5195
03:14:26,693 --> 03:14:31,293
Or are you doing like if someone like
were to were to swallow for me?

5196
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:34,110
No, I mean, if you were it's

5197
03:14:34,110 --> 03:14:36,327
like if you had the choice
between spitting and swallowing.

5198
03:14:37,077 --> 03:14:38,311
Oh, I'd. Swallow.

5199
03:14:38,311 --> 03:14:40,344
OK, yeah. Hey, what's that part?

5200
03:14:41,094 --> 03:14:41,694
Yeah,

5201
03:14:44,394 --> 03:14:44,861
no, I'm.

5202
03:14:44,861 --> 03:14:46,628
Not even a top or bottom.

5203
03:14:46,628 --> 03:14:49,478
It's just it's just like. Yeah, I like it
where.

5204
03:14:49,495 --> 03:14:52,979
If you if you're mad enough to take a shot
in the mouth, you should get

5205
03:14:52,979 --> 03:14:56,762
at least do them
the decency of using it as sustenance.

5206
03:14:56,762 --> 03:14:59,213
You know?
Mm hmm. Yeah. It's a lot of protein.

5207
03:15:01,079 --> 03:15:03,063
Lots and lots of protein.

5208
03:15:03,296 --> 03:15:05,463
I think we're talking
about the same thing, right?

5209
03:15:05,463 --> 03:15:08,247
To the same thing.
Yeah, of course you are.

5210
03:15:08,247 --> 03:15:09,547
And can you get that fucking bitch?

5211
03:15:09,547 --> 03:15:12,547
Oh, yeah. It's just a little overcooked.

5212
03:15:12,547 --> 03:15:13,381
Get it?

5213
03:15:16,081 --> 03:15:19,748
Why do we have 1300 points?

5214
03:15:20,198 --> 03:15:21,765
Oh, my God.

5215
03:15:21,765 --> 03:15:22,815
This is, like, our best.

5216
03:15:22,815 --> 03:15:24,215
Squirrel is going to look at me.

5217
03:15:24,215 --> 03:15:26,465
Like,
do you guys cheat? And we're like, no.

5218
03:15:26,465 --> 03:15:27,865
No, you didn't.

5219
03:15:27,865 --> 03:15:31,849
She see, he's happy. Oh.

5220
03:15:32,766 --> 03:15:33,416
Look at that.

5221
03:15:33,416 --> 03:15:34,766
31 more point.

5222
03:15:34,766 --> 03:15:36,933
And it would have been kind of cool.

5223
03:15:37,800 --> 03:15:39,933
Oh, yeah, it would have been really cool.

5224
03:15:40,567 --> 03:15:44,400
Probably kind of wheat, if anything.

5225
03:15:45,634 --> 03:15:49,017
You always, always like your back.

5226
03:15:49,234 --> 03:15:50,368
The knuckles.

5227
03:15:50,401 --> 03:15:52,951
Oh, no, that was.
That was my water bottle.

5228
03:15:52,951 --> 03:15:54,851
Right?
I thought that was your back. Oh, no.

5229
03:15:54,851 --> 03:15:56,402
Oh, I'm no

5230
03:15:57,602 --> 03:15:58,085
VOCs.

5231
03:15:58,085 --> 03:16:00,119
I'm nowhere near that.

5232
03:16:00,752 --> 03:16:01,685
I mean, you might be.

5233
03:16:01,685 --> 03:16:03,986
You're like 400, but for me.

5234
03:16:04,269 --> 03:16:08,586
I still got, like,
what, 80, 90 years ahead of me?

5235
03:16:08,819 --> 03:16:10,086
I'm chilling.

5236
03:16:10,436 --> 03:16:10,886
I'm great.

5237
03:16:10,886 --> 03:16:11,753
And I.

5238
03:16:11,753 --> 03:16:12,936
I guess, I guess that's true.

5239
03:16:12,936 --> 03:16:14,637
I mean, not all of us can have.

5240
03:16:14,637 --> 03:16:16,403
Not all of us can have. Have.

5241
03:16:16,403 --> 03:16:17,904
Why are we backing out of them?

5242
03:16:17,904 --> 03:16:20,004
Because I keep accidentally hit
the fucking spacebar.

5243
03:16:20,037 --> 03:16:21,104
Here, get.

5244
03:16:21,104 --> 03:16:24,188
I mean, this is my bag,
you know, I'm sorry.

5245
03:16:24,721 --> 03:16:25,688
I'm sorry.

5246
03:16:28,121 --> 03:16:28,988
What's the subject?

5247
03:16:28,988 --> 03:16:30,155
Me to the pizza. That's where you're at.

5248
03:16:30,155 --> 03:16:33,755
Harry Potter's Hogwarts
School of of mockery.

5249
03:16:34,005 --> 03:16:36,089
Visuals. I thought it was or something.

5250
03:16:36,089 --> 03:16:36,939
There is a bone.

5251
03:16:36,939 --> 03:16:39,239
Yeah, it's
one of the Kevin Love ornaments.

5252
03:16:39,239 --> 03:16:40,022
Given how. Many?

5253
03:16:40,022 --> 03:16:41,706
We have a three fucking wait.

5254
03:16:41,706 --> 03:16:43,473
There's Kevin's. There's a lot of Kevin.

5255
03:16:43,473 --> 03:16:44,273
It's looking Kevin's.

5256
03:16:44,273 --> 03:16:46,323
Have we missed brother brother.

5257
03:16:47,106 --> 03:16:48,923
Brother, brother.

5258
03:16:48,923 --> 03:16:50,457
I'm an occasional brother. Hmm.

5259
03:16:51,574 --> 03:16:53,124
I partake in a brother.

5260
03:16:53,124 --> 03:16:54,307
You know, I. We going to draw, right?

5261
03:16:54,307 --> 03:16:55,974
Why do you have to be the one that drives?

5262
03:16:55,974 --> 03:16:57,624
Why can't I drive?

5263
03:16:57,624 --> 03:16:59,458
Because I'm because I'm a bowler.

5264
03:16:59,458 --> 03:17:01,441
Because I'm a gangster like that.

5265
03:17:02,641 --> 03:17:04,175
Made zero sense.

5266
03:17:04,175 --> 03:17:06,992
Actually made zero sense there.

5267
03:17:07,258 --> 03:17:08,659
Why are you why who made you put.

5268
03:17:08,659 --> 03:17:10,809
You in control of the steering wheel?

5269
03:17:10,809 --> 03:17:12,776
But you on the planet.

5270
03:17:14,676 --> 03:17:16,076
I love the SpongeBob references.

5271
03:17:16,076 --> 03:17:19,143
Thank you. Thank you.

5272
03:17:19,143 --> 03:17:20,826
I can't find the other Kevin levels.

5273
03:17:20,826 --> 03:17:22,560
Do you want to do the John do?

5274
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:24,694
Let's do the super difficult Kevin level
and then we'll see.

5275
03:17:24,694 --> 03:17:26,677
Yeah, let's try and do the Kevin one.

5276
03:17:26,677 --> 03:17:28,777
And then we call it there.

5277
03:17:28,777 --> 03:17:31,444
Yeah. Only 580. How bad could it be?

5278
03:17:31,444 --> 03:17:32,994
Yeah. How bad could it be?

5279
03:17:35,495 --> 03:17:36,395
Steve.

5280
03:17:36,511 --> 03:17:39,495
Oh you said steamed. I said steamed them.

5281
03:17:39,578 --> 03:17:41,845
Oh, we're doing steamed again.

5282
03:17:41,912 --> 03:17:43,445
Well, we're. Masters.

5283
03:17:43,445 --> 03:17:46,946
You're on Oddfellow
but I must say, you seem a good ham.

5284
03:17:47,396 --> 03:17:49,379
You do that very well, you know that.

5285
03:17:49,379 --> 03:17:51,846
It's like you watched. It was times.

5286
03:17:51,846 --> 03:17:54,180
I kind of have all this.

5287
03:17:54,180 --> 03:17:55,947
All this is confusing me. Oh, no. Oh, no.

5288
03:17:55,947 --> 03:17:56,313
Oh, no.

5289
03:17:56,313 --> 03:17:56,847
Oh, no.

5290
03:17:56,847 --> 03:17:59,730
Oh, and there is fire everywhere. OK.

5291
03:17:59,730 --> 03:18:01,797
Really, it's gone. Do that to us.

5292
03:18:02,431 --> 03:18:02,997
All right, well.

5293
03:18:02,997 --> 03:18:03,964
Good luck, sir.

5294
03:18:03,964 --> 03:18:05,998
Let's start steaming some fish.

5295
03:18:06,148 --> 03:18:07,598
When there are carrots.

5296
03:18:07,598 --> 03:18:08,764
We got carrots.

5297
03:18:08,764 --> 03:18:12,715
You got carrots? Oh,

5298
03:18:14,198 --> 03:18:14,882
I think.

5299
03:18:14,882 --> 03:18:17,815
I think we should make use of the fire
extinguisher this time, though.

5300
03:18:17,815 --> 03:18:19,532
I think that's what you have to do.

5301
03:18:19,532 --> 03:18:21,032
So we don't like

5302
03:18:23,066 --> 03:18:24,116
I'll just have you on sound bite.

5303
03:18:24,116 --> 03:18:26,316
Fuck you. Oh, my God.

5304
03:18:27,150 --> 03:18:28,766
Look at all these.

5305
03:18:28,766 --> 03:18:30,417
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh, look.

5306
03:18:34,317 --> 03:18:34,534
Yeah.

5307
03:18:34,534 --> 03:18:35,067
The fires.

5308
03:18:35,067 --> 03:18:36,984
Oh, I'm literally trapped, dude.

5309
03:18:36,984 --> 03:18:39,117

Oh, my God.

5315
03:18:49,318 --> 03:18:50,769
This is confusing.

5316
03:18:53,369 --> 03:18:55,986
Carrot and flowers. Oh.

5317
03:18:55,986 --> 03:18:56,636

You ever had them some.
I've had them some. Yeah.

03:19:06,987 --> 03:19:07,954
It's like

5322
03:19:08,787 --> 03:19:10,437
for sure has shrimp inside of it.

5323
03:19:10,437 --> 03:19:12,604
It's like a dumpling,
but not really a dumpling.

03:19:13,387 --> 03:19:17,455
It's like has one on are dropping

03:19:28,956 --> 03:19:30,656
well, that's very beautiful.

5329
03:19:30,656 --> 03:19:33,323
I thought we were having steamed clams.

5330
03:19:34,973 --> 03:19:35,606
You're silly.

5331
03:19:35,606 --> 03:19:37,073
You're silly. Little
did you know that, right?

5332
03:19:37,073 --> 03:19:39,307
Oh, no, no. We're trapped again.

5333
03:19:39,907 --> 03:19:42,057
Blow it, blow it. Thank you. The job

time, bro.

5336
03:19:49,024 --> 03:19:49,858
Brah.

5337
03:19:51,541 --> 03:19:53,458
Yeah, this
this level is going to be the end of me.

5338
03:19:53,458 --> 03:19:55,958

5339
03:19:59,325 --> 03:20:00,709

5340
03:20:00,709 --> 03:20:02,359
Oh, fuck you.

03:20:16,944 --> 03:20:17,677
OK, it's cooking.

03:20:17,677 --> 03:20:18,511
It's cooking.

Thank you for the fresh clean plates.

That's OK. I'm your nurse. We know.

03:20:39,063 --> 03:20:39,563
All right, we need.

I need the fire extinguisher. Holy shit.

5361
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:47,580
Oh, my God.

5362
03:20:50,064 --> 03:20:50,647
The plate.

5363
03:20:50,647 --> 03:20:52,264
Overdue plate.

5364
03:20:53,164 --> 03:20:54,947
Wait a second. What? What do I do?

5365
03:20:54,947 --> 03:20:57,364
I put the shrimp in the dirt and I put.

5366
03:20:57,364 --> 03:20:58,798
The inside

5367
03:20:59,881 --> 03:21:02,315

03:21:02,315 --> 03:21:06,632
Oh, 10, oh, oh, oh, no.

5369
03:21:06,632 --> 03:21:07,865
I got to chop the shrimp up.

5370
03:21:07,865 --> 03:21:11,166
Sholto you fucking dumb arse.

5371
03:21:15,966 --> 03:21:19,133
OK, now, now we're bugging

5372
03:21:19,717 --> 03:21:20,883
30 seconds.

5373
03:21:20,883 --> 03:21:23,150
30 seconds. This one's off. This one.

5374
03:21:23,217 --> 03:21:24,534
This one's really rough.

5375
03:21:24,534 --> 03:21:27,117
I got trapped. I'm trapped. Oh, no.

5376
03:21:27,117 --> 03:21:27,417
I got it.

5377
03:21:27,417 --> 03:21:30,918
All right, OK.

5378
03:21:32,484 --> 03:21:32,818
General.

5379
03:21:32,818 --> 03:21:35,818
Clinically and strangely.

5380
03:21:36,935 --> 03:21:37,585
All. There's one right there.

5381
03:21:37,585 --> 03:21:39,869
There's one right
there is one right there.

5382
03:21:44,619 --> 03:21:46,769
This is a disaster.

5383
03:21:47,253 --> 03:21:49,103
Oh, no, I can't grab it
because the fire is in the.

5384
03:21:49,103 --> 03:21:50,636
Oh, no, wait. That's the other one.

5385
03:21:50,636 --> 03:21:52,553
Yeah, this is bad. Is really bad.

5386
03:21:52,553 --> 03:21:55,403
Paul Shetler. Pizarro style zero.

5387
03:21:57,804 --> 03:21:58,954
One star.

5388
03:21:58,954 --> 03:22:00,987
Hmm. I mean, technically, beat it.

5389
03:22:00,987 --> 03:22:02,004
But like. You.

5390
03:22:02,004 --> 03:22:04,504
There's just so much fire going around.
What are you guys now?

5391
03:22:04,538 --> 03:22:05,821
You think we can do it?

5392
03:22:05,821 --> 03:22:06,654
Can we do it?

5393
03:22:06,654 --> 03:22:07,738
I think we do it.

5394
03:22:07,738 --> 03:22:09,605
OK, all right.

5395
03:22:12,338 --> 03:22:13,655
Gay, gay, homosexual, gay.

5396
03:22:13,655 --> 03:22:15,155
Thank you for the song.

5397
03:22:24,906 --> 03:22:26,456
About The.

5398
03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:28,757
Fonz.

5399
03:22:29,073 --> 03:22:31,290
Yeah,
I like the fact that at least not on mic.

5400
03:22:31,324 --> 03:22:32,407
Like, not on call.

5401
03:22:32,407 --> 03:22:35,557
I haven't heard you've had you've thanked,
like, subs, but not by name.

5402
03:22:35,857 --> 03:22:39,091
And so all of a sudden, like,
the first gay, gay, homosexual,

5403
03:22:39,091 --> 03:22:42,275
gay, like,
I just wasn't prepared for that.

5404
03:22:42,275 --> 03:22:43,475
I had to read out that name.

5405
03:22:43,475 --> 03:22:44,675
It's golden.

5406
03:22:44,775 --> 03:22:45,158
Is it?

5407
03:22:45,158 --> 03:22:47,342
Is it is a golden boy. Yeah.

5408
03:22:48,159 --> 03:22:50,425
Okay, what's up? What's up, fish?

5409
03:22:50,425 --> 03:22:52,209
That you fish? I'm good at fish.

5410
03:22:56,826 --> 03:22:59,526
Grab this fire extinguisher
and put it close by just in case

5411
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:02,160
this is bullshit.

5412
03:23:04,843 --> 03:23:11,127
I'll grab the flower flower
and bring flowers and carrots.

5413
03:23:11,761 --> 03:23:13,044
Flowers and carrots carrots and flowers.

5414
03:23:13,044 --> 03:23:14,228
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

5415

Wait.

5416
03:23:14,394 --> 03:23:16,195
Where's the fire extinguisher
and the extinguisher?

5417
03:23:16,195 --> 03:23:18,245
Extinguisher. Thanks.

5418
03:23:19,778 --> 03:23:20,595
Thank you.

5419
03:23:23,645 --> 03:23:24,145
There we go.

5420
03:23:24,145 --> 03:23:26,912
We'll see each shrimp

5421
03:23:32,180 --> 03:23:33,463
ok? OK.

5422
03:23:33,463 --> 03:23:36,863
A plate

03:23:39,814 --> 03:23:42,997

5424
03:23:43,381 --> 03:23:45,397

5425
03:23:45,397 --> 03:23:46,231
Right now

5426
03:23:48,964 --> 03:23:50,248
oh, sorry.

5427
03:23:50,248 --> 03:23:50,665
All right,

5428
03:23:52,715 --> 03:23:55,115
I'm going to put this in the bowl.

5429
03:24:01,316 --> 03:24:01,949
That's fine.

5430
03:24:01,949 --> 03:24:04,383
Do it. All this fucking fire.

5431
03:24:04,383 --> 03:24:07,266
That's some fire.

5432
03:24:07,566 --> 03:24:10,017
All this bullshit blazing

5433
03:24:10,733 --> 03:24:12,750
OK. Shrimps going in there.

5434
03:24:13,584 --> 03:24:16,501
And I'm going to put that's all

5435
03:24:16,501 --> 03:24:18,251
flour, flour and shrimp.

5436
03:24:18,251 --> 03:24:20,051
From some church, from church.

5437
03:24:20,184 --> 03:24:21,834
I have a plunger.
Oh, I know you can do another one.

5438
03:24:21,834 --> 03:24:24,035
Yeah, I got this. I got the shrimp.
I got the shrimp.

5439
03:24:24,035 --> 03:24:25,085
I can. I can cook this one.

5440
03:24:29,102 --> 03:24:29,702
Please. No.

5441
03:24:29,702 --> 03:24:31,885
Oh, no, no.

5442
03:24:32,569 --> 03:24:33,936
My the microseconds away.

5443
03:24:33,936 --> 03:24:36,036
Oh, I'm so pissed.

5444
03:24:36,719 --> 03:24:37,919
I got it. I got it.

5445
03:24:37,919 --> 03:24:39,053
Oh, no, no. The fire.

5446
03:24:39,053 --> 03:24:39,603
Oh, no.

5447
03:24:39,603 --> 03:24:42,570
Oh, sell it.

5448
03:24:43,537 --> 03:24:45,420
Oh, my God.

5449
03:24:45,420 --> 03:24:46,703
Parker, this is hard.

5450
03:24:46,703 --> 03:24:49,320
The fire is such a clock.

5451
03:24:49,320 --> 03:24:52,504
Oh, I've never been so, like, I've never.

5452
03:24:52,504 --> 03:24:54,871
Been so caught by fire. Before.

5453
03:24:54,871 --> 03:24:57,505
It's even cooked the flour or not
the flour.

5454
03:24:57,721 --> 03:24:58,905
All of it.

5455
03:24:58,905 --> 03:25:00,138
Jesus,

5456
03:25:04,655 --> 03:25:06,389
and we work together now.

5457
03:25:06,389 --> 03:25:09,422
Do you think it's logical
for one of us to always have the the,

5458
03:25:09,622 --> 03:25:10,889
you know, the fire extinguisher on.

5459
03:25:10,889 --> 03:25:14,223
In it go around with the fire extinguisher
just getting rid of fire?

5460
03:25:14,223 --> 03:25:14,423
Yeah.

5461
03:25:14,423 --> 03:25:17,823
Like, one person handles fire
extinguishing and, like,

5462
03:25:17,823 --> 03:25:21,324
I don't know, cleaning plates,
and maybe that'll work,

5463
03:25:22,857 --> 03:25:25,207
like, get, like,
some kind of system there, because, like,

5464
03:25:25,374 --> 03:25:27,541
we can't just keep, like,
having one person, like,

5465
03:25:28,141 --> 03:25:31,024
each of us, like, go back and forth
with this extinguisher right.

5466
03:25:32,108 --> 03:25:33,091
What do you think?

5467
03:25:33,091 --> 03:25:35,258
Emotional damage.

5468
03:25:35,258 --> 03:25:37,959
Yeah, I think if he's.

5469
03:25:39,242 --> 03:25:41,225
There's a lot going on,
we keep failing orders as well.

5470
03:25:41,225 --> 03:25:41,576
Yeah.

5471
03:25:41,576 --> 03:25:44,392
Like, I can prioritise taking out the fire

5472
03:25:44,609 --> 03:25:47,526
and like when I can, I'll help you out
with the smaller things about that.

5473
03:25:48,059 --> 03:25:50,093
But that sounds good. Yeah.
All right. Let's try that.

5474
03:25:50,326 --> 03:25:52,393
OK, we start

5475
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:56,194
all right.

5476
03:25:56,194 --> 03:25:57,094
All right.

5477
03:25:58,177 --> 03:25:59,194
All right. You that.

5478
03:25:59,194 --> 03:25:59,977
Oh, right.

5479
03:25:59,977 --> 03:26:03,328
Yeah, I got to be
maybe like that guy from fire force. So

5480
03:26:05,795 --> 03:26:07,111
she never watch the the me.

5481
03:26:07,111 --> 03:26:08,011
I don't. Know.

5482
03:26:08,195 --> 03:26:08,878
I was going.

5483
03:26:08,878 --> 03:26:10,378
I show you this picture.

5484
03:26:14,762 --> 03:26:16,329
I know I can help

5485
03:26:19,079 --> 03:26:20,546
we're always in need of, like.

5486
03:26:20,546 --> 03:26:21,746
Flowers

5487
03:26:22,296 --> 03:26:23,430
like that.

5488
03:26:32,897 --> 03:26:33,781
He goes one.

5489
03:26:33,781 --> 03:26:37,181
Put some flowering carrot.

5490
03:26:43,598 --> 03:26:43,765
Good.

5491
03:26:43,765 --> 03:26:46,199
Grab the shrimp and put it in here.
With the sweet good. Yeah.

5492
03:26:46,599 --> 03:26:48,332
Yeah.
And I'm going start taking out some fires.

5493
03:26:49,716 --> 03:26:49,982
Oh, yeah.

5494
03:26:49,982 --> 03:26:50,816
Can you take out this one, please?

5495
03:26:50,816 --> 03:26:51,666
Really quick

5496
03:26:53,166 --> 03:26:53,766
thank you.

5497
03:26:56,633 --> 03:26:58,533
That's one dish.

Balance. Good.

5499
03:26:59,283 --> 03:27:01,800
I'm gonna put it inside.

5500
03:27:02,984 --> 03:27:04,700
It's a flower

5501
03:27:08,584 --> 03:27:09,567

5502
03:27:10,084 --> 03:27:12,151
Clay fish. Fresh fish.

Yeah, fish.

5504
03:27:13,951 --> 03:27:15,818
The fish ones are really easy.

5505
03:27:15,818 --> 03:27:16,418
Yeah,

Yeah. Yeah, I got you.
I got you. Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, you got it. You got it.

5515
03:27:39,754 --> 03:27:40,287
Oh, my God.

The three plates right
now, since that's a priority.

5517
03:27:42,387 --> 03:27:43,237
I have to go

5518
03:27:45,338 --> 03:27:46,388
finally to fish.

5519
03:27:46,388 --> 03:27:47,154
Once.

5520

OK, now plate's going.

5524
03:28:04,373 --> 03:28:06,306
You're doing a really good job of the day
place, by the way.

Oh, nice. Nice.

03:29:11,496 --> 03:29:12,113
Yep. That's ready.

5556
03:29:12,113 --> 03:29:12,896
That's ready.

5557
03:29:17,613 --> 03:29:20,364
Oh. Gaming.

5558
03:29:20,397 --> 03:29:20,764
Gaming.

03:29:20,764 --> 03:29:23,397
Yeah,
we're getting we're getting more gaming.

5560
03:29:30,365 --> 03:29:31,465
There's a fish ready to cut.

5561
03:29:31,465 --> 03:29:32,798
There's a fish already cut.

5562
03:29:32,798 --> 03:29:34,648
Yeah, I'll got that. I'll get the.

5563

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I can play this. You go get the ball.

5570
03:29:56,217 --> 03:29:57,434
Get the fish. Get the fish.

5571
03:29:57,434 --> 03:29:59,034
Yeah. Oh, no, I got the fish.

5572
03:29:59,034 --> 03:30:02,518

Then we go.

5574
03:30:05,518 --> 03:30:06,035
Play.

5575
03:30:06,035 --> 03:30:08,418
Oh, it was. Oh, glory, isn't it?

03:30:08,435 --> 03:30:10,202
No. Oh, my God.

I think we got one more.
I think we need one more.

5578
03:30:13,385 --> 03:30:15,086
Oh, dude.

5579
03:30:15,086 --> 03:30:19,303
The fire literally specifically cooked
the fish. 10.

5580
03:30:19,319 --> 03:30:22,086
I was really. Oh, so close.

5581
03:30:22,086 --> 03:30:24,453
Oh, my gosh.

5582
03:30:24,453 --> 03:30:27,604
Oh, all right. Oh.

5583
03:30:28,287 --> 03:30:29,437
Don't try one more. Enjoy.

5584
03:30:29,437 --> 03:30:32,004
I want to be one more.

5585
03:30:32,187 --> 03:30:33,271
I want to do one more. One more.

5586
03:30:33,271 --> 03:30:34,054
Yeah, just one more.

5587
03:30:34,054 --> 03:30:36,138
OK, last one last one for a moment.

5588
03:30:37,204 --> 03:30:37,805
All right.

5589
03:30:38,455 --> 03:30:40,772
This is our last attempt,
and we'll call it there.

5590
03:30:40,772 --> 03:30:41,555
Let's get.

5591
03:30:45,789 --> 03:30:48,206
Young men

5592
03:30:50,639 --> 03:30:51,956

5593
03:30:51,956 --> 03:30:55,923
once had that one, which is such a.

5594
03:30:56,573 --> 03:30:58,273

Just get that going.

Yeah, I'll get a flower going over here
for eating crab.

5598
03:31:06,207 --> 03:31:07,074
So we got a meat one.

5599
03:31:07,074 --> 03:31:08,308
We got a carrot one.

5600
03:31:08,308 --> 03:31:11,108
OK, meat

5601
03:31:12,991 --> 03:31:13,741

Suck now.

5669
03:33:55,807 --> 03:33:58,324
If one plates, you're not a plate

Just keep it going.
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

And don't fuck up.

5680
03:34:21,276 --> 03:34:22,343
Don't fuck up.

5681
03:34:25,377 --> 03:34:25,677

Oh, yeah. 80.

5698
03:35:00,564 --> 03:35:02,430
We need one more.

5699
03:35:02,430 --> 03:35:05,047
Oh, my God.

5700
03:35:05,047 --> 03:35:06,798
I felt like we were so cracked that right?

5701
03:35:06,798 --> 03:35:08,664
Yeah. We did so well too.

5702
03:35:08,664 --> 03:35:12,331
What's so hard Alonso? Difficult

5703
03:35:17,132 --> 03:35:18,749
oh, kinky.

5704
03:35:18,749 --> 03:35:20,849
Thank you for this.
Super glad you're enjoying this stream.

5705
03:35:20,849 --> 03:35:22,566
We did our best there.

5706
03:35:22,566 --> 03:35:24,599
We did our best yeah.

5707
03:35:24,599 --> 03:35:26,133
That fucking dog.

5708
03:35:26,133 --> 03:35:28,583
That fucking dog.

5709
03:35:28,816 --> 03:35:30,783
Oh, oh.

5710
03:35:30,783 --> 03:35:32,767
But yeah, I'm down.
You want to wrap. It, though?

5711
03:35:32,767 --> 03:35:34,984
Yeah, I'm. Done.
So wrap it up there. That's all for. Now.

5712
03:35:35,334 --> 03:35:36,234
I'm sleepy now.

5713
03:35:36,234 --> 03:35:38,217
I've already done that.
Have you done two stories today?

5714
03:35:38,217 --> 03:35:40,268
Yeah. You have.
You should get some rest there.

5715
03:35:40,284 --> 03:35:41,918
Two streams. Yeah, I will, I will.

5716
03:35:41,918 --> 03:35:43,801
I'm going to get ready for tomorrow.

5717
03:35:43,801 --> 03:35:48,568
I've been out of thing because we didn't
manage to finish Jump King a few days ago.

5718
03:35:48,818 --> 03:35:51,635
I'm thinking tomorrow
I might, like, start a little early,

5719
03:35:51,635 --> 03:35:52,719
see if I can finish jumping.

5720
03:35:52,719 --> 03:35:55,536
If you like an endurance,
you're at the church now or I'm.

5721
03:35:55,536 --> 03:35:56,302
At the church.

5722
03:35:56,302 --> 03:36:00,053
And I recall that the reason it took me
so long to beat it was because, like,

5723
03:36:00,053 --> 03:36:03,270
my brain was so, like, broken
at that point that I just,

5724
03:36:03,820 --> 03:36:05,703
like,
I was getting carpal tunnel in my thumb.

5725
03:36:05,703 --> 03:36:07,554
So, like, every, every time I did a jump

5726
03:36:07,554 --> 03:36:09,570
my thumb would twitch
and I would just jump. Yeah, you're.

5727
03:36:09,687 --> 03:36:11,754
Tired. You're getting, like,
really twitchy, and, like.

5728
03:36:11,754 --> 03:36:12,904
I was hungry.

5729
03:36:12,904 --> 03:36:15,754
Like, I'd been on a string for 17 hours
straight.

5730
03:36:15,754 --> 03:36:17,555
It was not good. Yeah. Oh, good.

5731
03:36:17,555 --> 03:36:20,905
So I was thinking, like,
on a better health, more healthy sound of,

5732
03:36:21,455 --> 03:36:22,555
like, mind and body.

5733
03:36:22,555 --> 03:36:25,589
I reckon I'd be able to beat it in,
like, 2 hours, so I might start tomorrow.

5734
03:36:25,589 --> 03:36:28,239
Just do jump King really early and then
switch to Minecraft in the afternoon.

5735
03:36:28,322 --> 03:36:30,989
All right. Yeah. OK,
thank you so much for.

5736
03:36:30,989 --> 03:36:33,473
Coming out to overcoat with me
in. Shelton.

5737
03:36:33,473 --> 03:36:35,706
It's been a lot of fun. I really enjoyed.

5738
03:36:35,706 --> 03:36:37,623
It. Turned from moulding to, like.

5739
03:36:37,623 --> 03:36:41,524
Sexual to like coordinating like 100%.

5740
03:36:42,124 --> 03:36:45,091
I quite genuinely
these are the most advanced call outs

5741
03:36:45,091 --> 03:36:49,174
I've made in a game
which I used to play like really sweetly.

5742
03:36:49,374 --> 03:36:52,108
Like, I like this is kind of
this is more call.

5743
03:36:52,108 --> 03:36:54,475
That's what I hear in most Apex matches.
This is insane.

5744
03:36:54,725 --> 03:36:56,708
You know,
I had a lot of fun with this yeah.

5745
03:36:56,708 --> 03:36:58,709
I a lot of fun to do one.

5746
03:36:58,709 --> 03:37:00,025
Thank you for cooking with me.

5747
03:37:00,025 --> 03:37:03,226
Well, it's uncanny. Thank you. All right.

Have a good day, dude.
Take care and get some rest.

5749
03:37:05,576 --> 03:37:07,109
We worked really hard. All right.

5750
03:37:07,109 --> 03:37:08,793
I'll see you around.

5751
03:37:08,793 --> 03:37:09,393
Bye bye.

5752
03:37:09,393 --> 03:37:12,893
Bye bye. VOCs secure. Bye bye.

5753
03:37:15,127 --> 03:37:17,577
OK, let me close out of

5754
03:37:17,577 --> 03:37:21,477
this, and I'll take my chef's
hat off for a second.

5755
03:37:21,477 --> 03:37:25,294
So give me a monumental all right?

5756
03:37:26,495 --> 03:37:29,312
So I can so we can talk about
what happened earlier,

5757
03:37:29,495 --> 03:37:32,345

I didn't see

5758
03:37:32,729 --> 03:37:35,345
what our one sound
and shot the entire time.

5759
03:37:35,345 --> 03:37:37,712
I just I couldn't adjust the I can moment

5760
03:37:39,863 --> 03:37:42,930
Hmm. Hello?

5761
03:37:43,080 --> 03:37:43,530

03:37:43,530 --> 03:37:46,680
Matsuura and Hepner. Both of you.

5763
03:37:46,913 --> 03:37:49,414

Like, hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds,

5768
03:37:56,881 --> 03:38:00,415
like a bowel vacuum
for for like number one spots.

5769
03:38:00,415 --> 03:38:03,698
Yeah, I was insane.

5770
03:38:03,698 --> 03:38:06,415
Yeah, it was like a sub war
that was happening the entire time.

5771
03:38:06,582 --> 03:38:10,532
Meanwhile, me and Vox were just, like,
fucking around and just, like, tossing

5772
03:38:10,766 --> 03:38:15,733
bread and cheese all over the place,
like, oh, my God, guys, you're insane.

5773
03:38:18,233 --> 03:38:19,716
You should do it. It.

Thank you so much for all the gift

Oh, my goodness.

5929
03:45:31,859 --> 03:45:34,259

03:45:34,259 --> 03:45:36,809

while we do this.

5934
03:45:46,377 --> 03:45:48,660
OK, so Barbie

5935
03:45:51,527 --> 03:45:54,494
you guys do this, by the way, like

5936
03:45:55,945 --> 03:45:58,595
make a pop noise of your mouth.

5937
03:46:06,479 --> 03:46:08,946
Yeah, you do that.

5938
03:46:09,796 --> 03:46:10,863
I really like doing that

5939
03:46:10,863 --> 03:46:13,080
a lot when I'm just, you know,

5940
03:46:14,163 --> 03:46:16,447
hibernate no fermenting,
just sitting there.

5941
03:46:16,647 --> 03:46:19,964
It's like my it's like when I go like
it's like when you say, ah,

5942
03:46:20,014 --> 03:46:23,847
you don't want to say next, but
it's more like a gesture, like I do a lot.

5943
03:46:24,064 --> 03:46:25,531
It's kind of like it's not a bad habit.

5944
03:46:25,531 --> 03:46:27,864
It's just a behavioural things like

5945
03:46:29,248 --> 03:46:30,781
I'm, I describe it so.

5946
03:46:30,781 --> 03:46:32,581
It's really silly

5947
03:46:35,048 --> 03:46:37,082
also of, of.

5948
03:46:37,082 --> 03:46:37,499
Of that.

5949
03:46:37,499 --> 03:46:40,049
Before I head off I want to say

5950
03:46:40,499 --> 03:46:43,166
we're not going to, we're going to have
our summer shrooms tomorrow.

5951
03:46:43,166 --> 03:46:43,683
Right.

5952
03:46:43,683 --> 03:46:45,183
I might start a little bit earlier

5953
03:46:45,183 --> 03:46:48,266
and it's going to be like 2 hours
ish long as usual.

5954
03:46:48,483 --> 03:46:52,350
I'll try to write a script like you are,
you know, as planned and

5955
03:46:52,950 --> 03:46:53,967
I'll know how this is going to go.

5956
03:46:53,967 --> 03:46:59,284
It's going to be another chill,
comforting summer day and I, I'm

5957
03:46:59,317 --> 03:47:02,068
a little nervous since in our script
writing is not my forte,

5958
03:47:02,068 --> 03:47:05,285
but I'll try my best to ah,
you know, have another.

5959
03:47:05,618 --> 03:47:06,335
Good night.

5960
03:47:06,335 --> 03:47:09,818
Comforting summer session
and we'll see how that goes.

5961
03:47:12,519 --> 03:47:14,886
So if you guys like the previous summer
sessions, be sure.

5962
03:47:14,886 --> 03:47:16,619
Show for that, OK?

5963
03:47:17,703 --> 03:47:18,836
All right.

5964
03:47:19,436 --> 03:47:21,053
I'm going to go and look for so-and-so
right now.

5965
03:47:21,053 --> 03:47:23,103
So take care, guys. Yeah, OK.

5966
03:47:24,353 --> 03:47:27,353
Let's see who's live right now.

5967
03:47:28,837 --> 03:47:32,554
Who is live and wants to get rated.

5968
03:47:33,304 --> 03:47:35,988
We have a

5969
03:47:36,838 --> 03:47:39,938
mm hmm.

5970
03:47:40,171 --> 03:47:42,572
OK. Oh, we can go and rage shy.

5971
03:47:42,572 --> 03:47:45,089
Lily, I don't think we've ever rated Lily
before.

5972
03:47:45,605 --> 03:47:46,989
Now become a nice right.

5973
03:47:46,989 --> 03:47:47,489
Yeah.

5974
03:47:47,489 --> 03:47:49,106
Let's go read Lily

5975
03:47:54,156 --> 03:47:56,456
take care, everybody, and be sure to rest.

5976
03:47:56,456 --> 03:47:59,607
Well, I know it's like Night-Time
for a lot of you, so go to sleep.

5977
03:47:59,607 --> 03:48:00,840
Soon, all right? Don't stay up too late.

5978
03:48:00,840 --> 03:48:05,191
And if you haven't already, please, again,
go support my friends.

5979
03:48:05,191 --> 03:48:07,974
Go support Vox's
Journal and subscribe to him.

5980
03:48:07,974 --> 03:48:10,224
If you haven't done so,
he is a wonderful person.

5981
03:48:10,224 --> 03:48:11,858
And in order to show

5982
03:48:13,175 --> 03:48:14,125
some love

5983
03:48:14,458 --> 03:48:18,508
and a big thanks to him for loving again
with me, it's always fun.

5984
03:48:19,109 --> 03:48:20,375
No matter what.

5985
03:48:20,759 --> 03:48:23,042
It's always an enjoyable time
when it comes to him.

5986
03:48:23,909 --> 03:48:25,976
No, I love you.

5987
03:48:25,976 --> 03:48:26,976

03:48:26,976 --> 03:48:28,593
Take care, OK?

As well.

5990
03:48:31,176 --> 03:48:33,510
And they'll see you tomorrow.

5991
03:48:33,577 --> 03:48:35,460
Bye bye.

5992
03:48:35,460 --> 03:48:37,994
Bye bye. Love

5993

5994
03:48:42,478 --> 03:48:43,794
Bye bye.

5995
03:48:45,211 --> 03:48:46,328
All right, let's go.

5996
03:48:46,328 --> 03:48:47,578
Where's my button?

5997
03:48:48,778 --> 03:48:49,778
My button.

5998
03:48:49,862 --> 03:48:55,845
Well, there it is. OK.
